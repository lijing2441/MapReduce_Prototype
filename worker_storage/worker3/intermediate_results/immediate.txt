it 1

on 1
mr 1
douglass 1
to 1
address 1
the 1
convention 1
he 1
came 1
forward 1
to 1
the 1
platform 1
with 1
a 1
hesitancy 1
and 1
embarrassment 1
necessarily 1
the 1
attendants 1
of 1
a 1
sensitive 1
mind 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
novel 1
position 1
after 1
apologizing 1
for 1
his 1
ignorance 1
and 1
reminding 1
the 1
audience 1
that 1
slavery 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
school 1
for 1
the 1
human 1
intellect 1
and 1
heart 1
he 1
proceeded 1
to 1
narrate 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
history 1
as 1
a 1
slave 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
his 1
speech 1
gave 1
utterance 1
to 1
many 1
noble 1
thoughts 1
and 1
thrilling 1
reflections 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
his 1
seat 1
filled 1
with 1
hope 1
and 1
admiration 1
i 1
rose 1
and 1
declared 1
that 1
patrick 1
henry 1
of 1
revolutionary 1
fame 1
never 1
made 1
a 1
speech 1
more 1
eloquent 1
in 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
liberty 1
than 1
the 1
one 1
we 1
had 1
just 1
listened 1
to 1
from 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
that 1
hunted 1
fugitive 1
so 1
i 1
believed 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
such 1
is 1
my 1
belief 1
now 1
i 1
reminded 1
the 1
audience 1
of 1
the 1
peril 1
which 1
surrounded 1
this 1
self 1
emancipated 1
young 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
north 1
even 1
in 1
massachusetts 1
on 1
the 1
soil 1
of 1
the 1
pilgrim 1
fathers 1
among 1
the 1
descendants 1
of 1
revolutionary 1
sires 1
and 1
i 1
appealed 1
to 1
them 1
whether 1
they 1
would 1
ever 1
allow 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
carried 1
back 1
into 1
slavery 1
law 1
or 1
no 1
law 1
constitution 1
or 1
no 1
constitution 1
the 1
response 1
was 1
unanimous 1
and 1
in 1
thunder 1
tones 1
no 1
will 1
you 1
succor 1
and 1
protect 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
brother 1
man 1
a 1
resident 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
bay 1
state 1
yes 1
shouted 1
the 1
whole 1
mass 1
with 1
an 1
energy 1
so 1
startling 1
that 1
the 1
ruthless 1
tyrants 1
south 1
of 1
mason 1
and 1
dixon 1
s 1
line 1
might 1
almost 1
have 1
heard 1
the 1
mighty 1
burst 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
recognized 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
pledge 1
of 1
an 1
invincible 1
determination 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
gave 1
it 1
never 1
to 1
betray 1
him 1
that 1
wanders 1
but 1
to 1
hide 1
the 1
outcast 1
and 1
firmly 1
to 1
abide 1
the 1
consequences 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
deeply 1
impressed 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
if 1
mr 1
douglass 1
could 1
be 1
persuaded 1
to 1
consecrate 1
his 1
time 1
and 1
talents 1
to 1
the 1
promotion 1
of 1
the 1
anti 1
slavery 1
enterprise 1
a 1
powerful 1
impetus 1
would 1
be 1
given 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
stunning 1
blow 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
inflicted 1
on 1
northern 1
prejudice 1
against 1
a 1
colored 1
complexion 1
i 1
therefore 1
endeavored 1
to 1
instil 1
hope 1
and 1
courage 1
into 1
his 1
mind 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
dare 1
to 1
engage 1
in 1
a 1
vocation 1
so 1
anomalous 1
and 1
responsible 1
for 1
a 1
person 1
in 1
his 1
situation 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
seconded 1
in 1
this 1
effort 1
by 1
warm 1
hearted 1
friends 1
especially 1
by 1
the 1
late 1
general 1
agent 1
of 1
the 1
massachusetts 1
anti 1
slavery 1
society 1
mr 1
john 1
a 1
collins 1
whose 1
judgment 1
in 1
this 1
instance 1
entirely 1
coincided 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
could 1
give 1
no 1
encouragement 1
with 1
unfeigned 1
diffidence 1
he 1
expressed 1
his 1
conviction 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
adequate 1
to 1
the 1
performance 1
of 1
so 1
great 1
a 1
task 1
the 1
path 1
marked 1
out 1
was 1
wholly 1
an 1
untrodden 1
one 1
he 1
was 1
sincerely 1
apprehensive 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
do 1
more 1
harm 1
than 1
good 1
after 1
much 1
deliberation 1
however 1
he 1
consented 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
trial 1
and 1
ever 1
since 1
that 1
period 1
he 1
has 1
acted 1
as 1
a 1
lecturing 1
agent 1
under 1
the 1
auspices 1
either 1
of 1
the 1
american 1
or 1
the 1
massachusetts 1
anti 1
slavery 1
society 1
in 1
labors 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
most 1
abundant 1
and 1
his 1
success 1
in 1
combating 1
prejudice 1
in 1
gaining 1
proselytes 1
in 1
agitating 1
the 1
public 1
mind 1
has 1
far 1
surpassed 1
the 1
most 1
sanguine 1
expectations 1
that 1
were 1
raised 1
at 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
his 1
brilliant 1
career 1
he 1
has 1
borne 1
himself 1
with 1
gentleness 1
and 1
meekness 1
yet 1
with 1
true 1
manliness 1
of 1
character 1
as 1
a 1
public 1
speaker 1
he 1
excels 1
in 1
pathos 1
wit 1
comparison 1
imitation 1
strength 1
of 1
reasoning 1
and 1
fluency 1
of 1
language 1
there 1
is 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
union 1
of 1
head 1
and 1
heart 1
which 1
is 1
indispensable 1
to 1
an 1
enlightenment 1
of 1
the 1
heads 1
and 1
a 1
winning 1
of 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
others 1
may 1
his 1
strength 1
continue 1
to 1
be 1
equal 1
to 1
his 1
day 1
may 1
he 1
continue 1
to 1
grow 1
in 1
grace 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
god 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
increasingly 1
serviceable 1
in 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
bleeding 1
humanity 1
whether 1
at 1
home 1
or 1
abroad 1

themselves 1

baseness 1

illiberality 1

henceforth 1

point 1
of 1
human 1
excellence 1
it 1
may 1
perhaps 1
be 1
fairly 1
questioned 1
whether 1
any 1
other 1
portion 1

privations 1

horrors 1
of 1
slavery 1
without 1
having 1
become 1
more 1
degraded 1
in 1
the 1

than 1
the 1

moral 1
nature 1
obliterate 1
all 1
traces 1
of 1
their 1
relationship 1
to 1
mankind 1

yet 1
how 1
wonderfully 1
they 1
have 1
sustained 1
the 1
mighty 1
load 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
frightful 1
bondage 1
under 1
which 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
groaning 1

centuries 1

the 1
effect 1
of 1

every 1

man 1
_ 1
an 1
american 1
sailor 1
who 1
was 1
cast 1
away 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
of 1
africa 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
kept 1
in 1
slavery 1
for 1
three 1
years 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
expiration 1
of 1
that 1
period 1
found 1
to 1
be 1
imbruted 1
and 1
stultified 1
he 1
had 1
lost 1
all 1
reasoning 1
power 1
and 1
having 1
forgotten 1
his 1
native 1
language 1
could 1
only 1
utter 1
some 1
savage 1
gibberish 1

nobody 1
could 1
understand 1

even 1

institution 1

this 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
case 1
of 1
mental 1
deterioration 1
it 1
proves 1
at 1
least 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
slave 1
can 1
sink 1
as 1
low 1
in 1
the 1
scale 1
of 1
humanity 1
as 1
the 1
black 1
one 1
mr 1
douglass 1
has 1
very 1
properly 1
chosen 1
to 1
write 1
his 1
own 1
narrative 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
style 1
and 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
his 1
ability 1
rather 1
than 1
to 1
employ 1
some 1
one 1
else 1
it 1
is 1
therefore 1
entirely 1
his 1
own 1
production 1
and 1
considering 1
how 1
long 1
and 1
dark 1
was 1
the 1
career 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
run 1
as 1
a 1
slave 1
how 1
few 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
opportunities 1
to 1
improve 1
his 1
mind 1
since 1
he 1
broke 1
his 1
iron 1
fetters 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
judgment 1
highly 1
creditable 1
to 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
heart 1
he 1
who 1
can 1
peruse 1
it 1
without 1
a 1
tearful 1
eye 1
a 1
heaving 1
breast 1
an 1
afflicted 1
spirit 1
without 1
being 1
filled 1
with 1
an 1
unutterable 1
abhorrence 1
of 1
slavery 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
abettors 1
and 1
animated 1
with 1
a 1
determination 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
immediate 1
overthrow 1
of 1
that 1
execrable 1
system 1
without 1
trembling 1
for 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
this 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
a 1
righteous 1
god 1
who 1
is 1
ever 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
oppressed 1
and 1
whose 1
arm 1
is 1
not 1
shortened 1
that 1
it 1
cannot 1
save 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
flinty 1
heart 1
and 1
be 1
qualified 1
to 1
act 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
trafficker 1
in 1
slaves 1
and 1
the 1
souls 1
of 1
men 1
i 1
am 1
confident 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
essentially 1
true 1
in 1
all 1
its 1
statements 1
that 1
nothing 1
has 1
been 1
set 1
down 1
in 1
malice 1
nothing 1
exaggerated 1
nothing 1
drawn 1
from 1
the 1
imagination 1
that 1
it 1
comes 1
short 1
of 1
the 1
reality 1
rather 1
than 1
overstates 1
a 1
single 1
fact 1
in 1
regard 1
to 1
slavery 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
experience 1
of 1
frederick 1
douglass 1
as 1
a 1
slave 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
peculiar 1
one 1
his 1
lot 1
was 1
not 1
especially 1
a 1
hard 1
one 1
his 1
case 1
may 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
a 1
very 1
fair 1
specimen 1
of 1
the 1
treatment 1
of 1
slaves 1
in 1
maryland 1
in 1
which 1
state 1
it 1
is 1
conceded 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
better 1
fed 1
and 1
less 1
cruelly 1
treated 1
than 1
in 1
georgia 1
alabama 1
or 1
louisiana 1
many 1
have 1
suffered 1
incomparably 1
more 1
while 1
very 1
few 1
on 1
the 1
plantations 1
have 1
suffered 1
less 1
than 1
himself 1
yet 1
how 1
deplorable 1
was 1
his 1
situation 1
what 1
terrible 1
chastisements 1
were 1
inflicted 1
upon 1
his 1
person 1
what 1
still 1
more 1
shocking 1
outrages 1
were 1
perpetrated 1
upon 1
his 1
mind 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
noble 1
powers 1
and 1
sublime 1
aspirations 1
how 1
like 1
a 1
brute 1
was 1
he 1
treated 1
even 1
by 1
those 1
professing 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
mind 1
in 1
them 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
christ 1
jesus 1
to 1
what 1
dreadful 1
liabilities 1
was 1
he 1
continually 1
subjected 1
how 1
destitute 1
of 1
friendly 1
counsel 1
and 1
aid 1
even 1
in 1
his 1
greatest 1
extremities 1
how 1
heavy 1
was 1
the 1
midnight 1
of 1
woe 1
which 1
shrouded 1
in 1
blackness 1
the 1
last 1
ray 1
of 1
hope 1
and 1
filled 1
the 1
future 1
with 1
terror 1
and 1
gloom 1
what 1
longings 1
after 1
freedom 1
took 1
possession 1
of 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
how 1
his 1
misery 1
augmented 1
in 1
proportion 1
as 1
he 1
grew 1
reflective 1
and 1
intelligent 1
thus 1
demonstrating 1
that 1
a 1
happy 1
slave 1
is 1
an 1
extinct 1
man 1
how 1
he 1
thought 1
reasoned 1
felt 1
under 1
the 1
lash 1
of 1
the 1
driver 1
with 1
the 1
chains 1
upon 1
his 1
limbs 1
what 1
perils 1
he 1
encountered 1
in 1
his 1
endeavors 1
to 1
escape 1
from 1
his 1
horrible 1
doom 1
and 1
how 1
signal 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
deliverance 1
and 1
preservation 1
in 1
the 1

of 1

nation 1
of 1
pitiless 1
enemies 1
this 1
narrative 1
contains 1
many 1
affecting 1
incidents 1
many 1
passages 1
of 1
great 1
eloquence 1
and 1
power 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
the 1
most 1
thrilling 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
all 1
is 1
the 1
description 1
douglass 1
gives 1
of 1
his 1
feelings 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
soliloquizing 1
respecting 1
his 1
fate 1
and 1
the 1
chances 1
of 1
his 1
one 1

by 1
the 1
living 1
spirit 1
of 1

that 1
passage 1

so 1
profoundly 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
slavery 1
are 1
many 1
persons 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
stubbornly 1
incredulous 1
whenever 1
they 1
read 1
or 1
listen 1
to 1
any 1
recital 1
of 1
the 1
cruelties 1
which 1
are 1
daily 1
inflicted 1
on 1
its 1
victims 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
deny 1
that 1
the 1
slaves 1
are 1
held 1
as 1
property 1
but 1
that 1
terrible 1
fact 1
seems 1
to 1
convey 1
to 1
their 1
minds 1
no 1
idea 1
of 1
injustice 1
exposure 1
to 1
outrage 1
or 1
savage 1
barbarity 1
tell 1
them 1
of 1
cruel 1
scourgings 1
of 1
mutilations 1
and 1
brandings 1
of 1
scenes 1
of 1
pollution 1
and 1
blood 1
of 1
the 1
banishment 1
of 1
all 1
light 1
and 1
knowledge 1
and 1
they 1
affect 1
to 1
be 1
greatly 1
indignant 1
at 1
such 1
enormous 1
exaggerations 1
such 1
wholesale 1
misstatements 1
such 1
abominable 1
libels 1
on 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
southern 1
planters 1
as 1
if 1
all 1
these 1
direful 1
outrages 1
were 1
not 1
the 1
natural 1
results 1
of 1
slavery 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
less 1
cruel 1

reduce 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
to 1
the 1
condition 1

to 1

in 1

some 1
few 1

their 1
incredulity 1
arises 1
from 1
a 1

generally 1
it 1
indicates 1

desire 1

are 1

frankly 1
disclosed 1

easily 1
be 1
disproved 1

are 1
untrue 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
his 1
narrative 1

relates 1
two 1
instances 1
of 1
murderous 1
cruelty 1
in 1

of 1
which 1
a 1

deliberately 1
shot 1
a 1

1845 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
you 1
remember 1
the 1
old 1
fable 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
where 1
the 1
lion 1
complained 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
misrepresented 1
when 1
the 1
lions 1
wrote 1
history 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
the 1
time 1
has 1
come 1
when 1
the 1
lions 1
write 1
history 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
left 1
long 1
enough 1
to 1
gather 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
slavery 1
from 1
the 1
involuntary 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
masters 1
one 1
might 1
indeed 1
rest 1
sufficiently 1
satisfied 1
with 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
evident 1
must 1
be 1
in 1
general 1
the 1
results 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
relation 1
without 1
seeking 1
farther 1
to 1
find 1
whether 1
they 1
have 1
followed 1
in 1
every 1
instance 1
indeed 1
those 1
who 1
stare 1
at 1
the 1
half 1
peck 1
of 1
corn 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
love 1
to 1
count 1
the 1
lashes 1
on 1
the 1
slave 1
s 1
back 1
are 1
seldom 1
the 1
stuff 1
out 1
of 1
which 1
reformers 1
and 1
abolitionists 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
i 1
remember 1
that 1
in 1
1838 1
many 1
were 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
results 1
of 1
the 1
west 1
india 1
experiment 1
before 1
they 1
could 1
come 1
into 1
our 1
ranks 1
those 1
results 1
have 1
come 1
long 1
ago 1
but 1
alas 1
few 1
of 1
that 1
number 1
have 1
come 1
with 1
them 1
as 1
converts 1
a 1
man 1
must 1
be 1
disposed 1
to 1
judge 1
of 1
emancipation 1
by 1
other 1
tests 1
than 1
whether 1
it 1
has 1
increased 1
the 1
produce 1
of 1
sugar 1
and 1
to 1
hate 1
slavery 1
for 1
other 1
reasons 1
than 1
because 1
it 1
starves 1
men 1
and 1
whips 1
women 1
before 1
he 1
is 1
ready 1
to 1
lay 1
the 1
first 1
stone 1
of 1
his 1
anti 1
slavery 1
life 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
learn 1
in 1
your 1
story 1
how 1
early 1
the 1
most 1
neglected 1
of 1
god 1
s 1
children 1
waken 1
to 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
their 1
rights 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
injustice 1
done 1
them 1
experience 1
is 1
a 1
keen 1
teacher 1
and 1
long 1
before 1
you 1
had 1
mastered 1
your 1
a 1
b 1
c 1
or 1
knew 1
where 1
the 1
white 1
sails 1
of 1
the 1
chesapeake 1
were 1
bound 1
you 1
began 1
i 1
see 1
to 1
gauge 1
the 1
wretchedness 1
of 1
the 1
slave 1
not 1
by 1
his 1
hunger 1
and 1
want 1
not 1
by 1
his 1
lashes 1
and 1
toil 1
but 1
by 1
the 1
cruel 1
and 1
blighting 1
death 1
which 1
gathers 1
over 1
his 1
soul 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
this 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
circumstance 1
which 1
makes 1
your 1
recollections 1
peculiarly 1
valuable 1
and 1
renders 1
your 1
early 1
insight 1
the 1
more 1
remarkable 1
you 1
come 1
from 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
where 1
we 1
are 1
told 1
slavery 1
appears 1
with 1
its 1
fairest 1
features 1
let 1
us 1
hear 1
then 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
at 1
its 1
best 1
estate 1

on 1
its 1
bright 1
side 1
if 1
it 1
has 1
one 1
and 1
then 1
imagination 1
may 1
task 1
her 1
powers 1
to 1
add 1
dark 1
lines 1
to 1
the 1
picture 1
as 1
she 1
travels 1
southward 1
to 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
colored 1
man 1
valley 1
of 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
death 1
where 1
the 1
mississippi 1
sweeps 1
along 1
again 1
we 1
have 1
known 1
you 1
long 1

put 1
the 1
most 1
entire 1
confidence 1
in 1
your 1
truth 1
candor 1
and 1
sincerity 1

and 1
i 1
am 1
confident 1
every 1
one 1
who 1
reads 1
your 1
book 1
will 1
feel 1
persuaded 1
that 1
you 1
give 1
them 1
a 1
fair 1
specimen 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
truth 1
no 1
one 1
sided 1
portrait 1
no 1
wholesale 1
complaints 1
but 1
strict 1
justice 1
done 1
whenever 1
individual 1
kindliness 1
has 1
neutralized 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
deadly 1
system 1
with 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
strangely 1
allied 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
with 1
us 1
too 1
some 1
years 1
and 1
can 1
fairly 1
compare 1
the 1
twilight 1
of 1
rights 1
which 1
your 1
race 1
enjoy 1
at 1
the 1
north 1
with 1
that 1
noon 1
of 1

which 1
they 1

us 1
whether 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
half 1
free 1
colored 1
man 1
of 1
massachusetts 1
is 1
worse 1
off 1
than 1
the 1
pampered 1
slave 1
of 1
the 1
rice 1
swamps 1
in 1
reading 1
your 1
life 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
unfairly 1
picked 1
out 1
some 1
rare 1
specimens 1
of 1
cruelty 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
bitter 1
drops 1
which 1
even 1
you 1
have 1
drained 1
from 1
the 1
cup 1
are 1
no 1
incidental 1
aggravations 1
no 1
individual 1
ills 1
but 1
such 1
as 1
must 1
mingle 1
always 1
and 1
necessarily 1
in 1
the 1
lot 1
of 1
every 1
slave 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
essential 1
ingredients 1
not 1
the 1
occasional 1
results 1
of 1
the 1
system 1
after 1
all 1
i 1
shall 1
read 1
your 1
book 1
with 1
trembling 1
for 1
you 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
when 1
you 1
were 1
beginning 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
your 1
real 1
name 1
and 1
birthplace 1
you 1
may 1
remember 1
i 1
stopped 1
you 1
and 1
preferred 1
to 1
remain 1
ignorant 1
of 1
all 1
with 1
the 1

vague 1
description 1
so 1
i 1
continued 1
till 1
the 1
other 1
day 1
when 1
you 1
read 1
me 1
your 1
memoirs 1
i 1
hardly 1
knew 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
whether 1
to 1
thank 1
you 1
or 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
them 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
still 1
dangerous 1
in 1
massachusetts 1
for 1
honest 1
men 1
to 1
tell 1
their 1
names 1
they 1
say 1
the 1
fathers 1
in 1
1776 1
signed 1
the 1
declaration 1
of 1
independence 1
with 1
the 1
halter 1
about 1
their 1
necks 1
you 1
too 1
publish 1
your 1
declaration 1
of 1
freedom 1
with 1
danger 1
compassing 1
you 1
around 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
broad 1
lands 1
which 1
the 1
constitution 1
of 1
the 1
united 1
states 1
overshadows 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
single 1
spot 1
however 1
narrow 1
or 1
desolate 1
where 1
a 1
fugitive 1
slave 1
can 1
plant 1
himself 1
and 1
say 1
i 1
am 1
safe 1
the 1
whole 1
armory 1
of 1
northern 1
law 1
has 1
no 1
shield 1
for 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
free 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
in 1
your 1
place 1
i 1
should 1
throw 1
the 1
ms 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
you 1
perhaps 1
may 1
tell 1
your 1
story 1
in 1
safety 1
endeared 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
so 1
many 1
warm 1
hearts 1
by 1
rare 1
gifts 1
and 1
a 1
still 1
rarer 1
devotion 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
service 1
of 1
others 1
but 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
owing 1
only 1
to 1
your 1
labors 1
and 1
the 1
fearless 1
efforts 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
trampling 1
the 1
laws 1
and 1
constitution 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
under 1
their 1
feet 1
are 1
determined 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
hide 1
the 1
outcast 1
and 1
that 1
their 1
hearths 1
shall 1
be 1
spite 1
of 1

the 1

if 1
some 1
time 1
or 1
other 1
the 1
humblest 1
may 1
stand 1
in 1
our 1
streets 1
and 1
bear 1
witness 1
in 1
safety 1
against 1
the 1
cruelties 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
the 1
victim 1
yet 1
it 1
is 1
sad 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
these 1
very 1
throbbing 1
hearts 1
which 1
welcome 1
your 1

was 1
not 1
sure 1
of 1
the 1
exact 1
year 1
of 1
his 1
birth 1
but 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
1817 1
or 1
1818 1
as 1
a 1
young 1
boy 1
he 1
was 1
sent 1
to 1
baltimore 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
house 1
servant 1
where 1
he 1
learned 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
write 1
with 1
the 1
assistance 1
of 1
his 1
master 1

he 1
married 1

free 1
colored 1
woman 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
met 1

the 1
massachusetts 1
anti 1

society 1
in 1
nantucket 1
and 1
so 1
greatly 1
impressed 1
the 1
group 1
that 1
they 1
immediately 1
employed 1
him 1
as 1
an 1
agent 1
he 1
was 1
such 1
an 1
impressive 1
orator 1
that 1
numerous 1
persons 1
doubted 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
a 1
slave 1
so 1
he 1
wrote 1
narrative 1

the 1
life 1
of 1
frederick 1

consistently 1
argued 1
for 1
the 1
emancipation 1

was 1
active 1
in 1
securing 1

protecting 1
the 1

the 1

little 1
of 1
their 1
ages 1
as 1
horses 1
know 1
of 1
theirs 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
wish 1
of 1
most 1
masters 1
within 1
my 1
knowledge 1
to 1
keep 1
their 1
slaves 1
thus 1
ignorant 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
remember 1
to 1
have 1
ever 1
met 1
a 1
slave 1
who 1
could 1
tell 1
of 1
his 1
birthday 1
they 1
seldom 1
come 1
nearer 1
to 1
it 1

fall 1
time 1
a 1
want 1
of 1
information 1
concerning 1
my 1
own 1
was 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
unhappiness 1
to 1
me 1
even 1
during 1
childhood 1
the 1
white 1
children 1
could 1
tell 1
their 1
ages 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
why 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
deprived 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
privilege 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
inquiries 1
of 1
my 1
master 1
concerning 1
it 1
he 1
deemed 1
all 1
such 1
inquiries 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
slave 1
improper 1
and 1
impertinent 1
and 1
evidence 1
of 1
a 1
restless 1
spirit 1
the 1
nearest 1
estimate 1
i 1
can 1
give 1
makes 1
me 1
now 1
between 1
twenty 1
seven 1
and 1
twenty 1
eight 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
this 1
from 1
hearing 1
my 1
master 1
say 1
some 1
time 1
during 1
1835 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
seventeen 1
years 1
old 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
named 1
harriet 1
bailey 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
isaac 1
and 1
betsey 1
bailey 1
both 1
colored 1
and 1
quite 1
dark 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
darker 1
complexion 1
than 1
either 1
my 1
grandmother 1
or 1
grandfather 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
white 1
man 1
he 1
was 1
admitted 1
to 1
be 1
such 1
by 1
all 1
i 1
ever 1
heard 1
speak 1
of 1
my 1
parentage 1
the 1
opinion 1
was 1
also 1
whispered 1
that 1
my 1
master 1
was 1
my 1
father 1
but 1
of 1
the 1
correctness 1
of 1
this 1
opinion 1
i 1
know 1
nothing 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
knowing 1
was 1
withheld 1
from 1
me 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
separated 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
but 1
an 1
infant 1
before 1
i 1
knew 1
her 1
as 1
my 1
mother 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
common 1
custom 1
in 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
maryland 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
ran 1
away 1
to 1
part 1
children 1
from 1
their 1
mothers 1
at 1
a 1
very 1
early 1
age 1
frequently 1
before 1
the 1
child 1
has 1
reached 1
its 1
twelfth 1
month 1
its 1
mother 1
is 1
taken 1
from 1
it 1
and 1
hired 1
out 1
on 1
some 1
farm 1
a 1
considerable 1
distance 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
is 1
placed 1
under 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
too 1
old 1
for 1
field 1
labor 1
for 1
what 1
this 1
separation 1
is 1
done 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
unless 1
it 1
be 1
to 1
hinder 1
the 1
development 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
affection 1
toward 1
its 1
mother 1
and 1
to 1
blunt 1
and 1
destroy 1
the 1
natural 1
affection 1
of 1
the 1
mother 1
for 1
the 1
child 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
inevitable 1
result 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
my 1
mother 1
to 1
know 1
her 1
as 1
such 1
more 1
than 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
times 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
each 1
of 1
these 1
times 1
was 1
very 1
short 1
in 1
duration 1
and 1
at 1
night 1
she 1
was 1
hired 1
by 1
a 1
mr 1
stewart 1
who 1
lived 1
about 1
twelve 1
miles 1
from 1
my 1
home 1
she 1
made 1
her 1
journeys 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
travelling 1
the 1
whole 1
distance 1
on 1
foot 1
after 1
the 1
performance 1
of 1
her 1
day 1
s 1
work 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
field 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
whipping 1
is 1
the 1
penalty 1
of 1
not 1
being 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
at 1
sunrise 1
unless 1
a 1
slave 1
has 1
special 1
permission 1
from 1
his 1
or 1
her 1
master 1
to 1
the 1
contrary 1
a 1
permission 1
which 1
they 1
seldom 1
get 1
and 1
one 1
that 1
gives 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
gives 1
it 1
the 1
proud 1
name 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
kind 1
master 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
recollect 1
of 1
ever 1
seeing 1
my 1
mother 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
she 1
was 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
would 1
lie 1
down 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
get 1
me 1
to 1
sleep 1
but 1
long 1
before 1
i 1
waked 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
very 1
little 1
communication 1
ever 1
took 1
place 1
between 1
us 1
death 1
soon 1
ended 1
what 1
little 1
we 1
could 1
have 1
while 1
she 1
lived 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
her 1
hardships 1
and 1
suffering 1
she 1
died 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
seven 1
years 1
old 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
master 1
s 1
farms 1
near 1
lee 1
s 1
mill 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
be 1
present 1
during 1
her 1
illness 1
at 1
her 1
death 1
or 1
burial 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
long 1
before 1
i 1
knew 1
any 1

any 1
considerable 1
extent 1
her 1
soothing 1
presence 1
her 1
tender 1
and 1
watchful 1
care 1
i 1
received 1
the 1
tidings 1
of 1
her 1
death 1
with 1
much 1
the 1
same 1
emotions 1
i 1
should 1

probably 1
felt 1
at 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
a 1
stranger 1
called 1
thus 1
suddenly 1
away 1
she 1
left 1
me 1
without 1
the 1
slightest 1
intimation 1
of 1
who 1

or 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
true 1
and 1
true 1
or 1
false 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
but 1
little 1
consequence 1
to 1
my 1
purpose 1
whilst 1
the 1
fact 1
remains 1
in 1
all 1
its 1
glaring 1
odiousness 1
that 1
slaveholders 1
have 1
ordained 1
and 1
by 1
law 1
established 1
that 1
the 1
children 1
of 1
slave 1
women 1
shall 1
in 1
all 1
cases 1
follow 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
their 1
mothers 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
done 1
too 1
obviously 1
to 1
administer 1
to 1
their 1
own 1
lusts 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
gratification 1
of 1
their 1
wicked 1
desires 1
profitable 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
pleasurable 1
for 1
by 1
this 1
cunning 1
arrangement 1
the 1
slaveholder 1
in 1
cases 1
not 1
a 1
few 1
sustains 1
to 1
his 1
slaves 1
the 1
double 1
relation 1
of 1
master 1
and 1
father 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
such 1
cases 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
worthy 1
of 1
remark 1
that 1
such 1
slaves 1
invariably 1
suffer 1
greater 1
hardships 1
and 1
have 1
more 1
to 1
contend 1
with 1
than 1
others 1
they 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
a 1
constant 1
offence 1
to 1
their 1
mistress 1
she 1
is 1
ever 1
disposed 1
to 1
find 1
fault 1
with 1
them 1
they 1
can 1
seldom 1
do 1
any 1
thing 1
to 1
please 1
her 1
she 1
is 1
never 1
better 1
pleased 1
than 1
when 1
she 1
sees 1
them 1
under 1
the 1
lash 1
especially 1
when 1
she 1
suspects 1
her 1
husband 1
of 1
showing 1
to 1
his 1
mulatto 1
children 1
favors 1
which 1
he 1
withholds 1
from 1
his 1
black 1
slaves 1
the 1
master 1
is 1
frequently 1
compelled 1
to 1
sell 1
this 1
class 1
of 1
his 1
slaves 1
out 1
of 1
deference 1
to 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
his 1
white 1
wife 1
and 1
cruel 1
as 1
the 1
deed 1
may 1
strike 1
any 1
one 1
to 1
be 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
sell 1
his 1
own 1
children 1
to 1
human 1
flesh 1
mongers 1
it 1
is 1
often 1
the 1
dictate 1
of 1
humanity 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
for 1
unless 1
he 1
does 1
this 1
he 1
must 1
not 1
only 1
whip 1
them 1
himself 1
but 1
must 1
stand 1
by 1
and 1
see 1
one 1
white 1
son 1
tie 1
up 1
his 1
brother 1
of 1
but 1
few 1
shades 1
darker 1
complexion 1
than 1
himself 1
and 1
ply 1
the 1
gory 1
lash 1
to 1
his 1
naked 1
back 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
lisp 1
one 1
word 1
of 1
disapproval 1
it 1
is 1
set 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
parental 1
partiality 1
and 1
only 1
makes 1
a 1
bad 1
matter 1
worse 1
both 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
the 1
slave 1
whom 1
he 1
would 1
protect 1
and 1
defend 1
every 1
year 1
brings 1
with 1
it 1
multitudes 1
of 1
this 1
class 1
of 1
slaves 1
it 1
was 1
doubtless 1
in 1
consequence 1
of 1
a 1
knowledge 1
of 1
this 1
fact 1
that 1
one 1
great 1
statesman 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
predicted 1
the 1
downfall 1
of 1
slavery 1
by 1
the 1
inevitable 1
laws 1
of 1
population 1
whether 1
this 1
prophecy 1
is 1
ever 1
fulfilled 1
or 1
not 1
it 1
is 1
nevertheless 1
plain 1
that 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
looking 1
class 1
of 1
people 1
are 1
springing 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
south 1
and 1
are 1
now 1
held 1
in 1
slavery 1
from 1
those 1
originally 1
brought 1
to 1
this 1
country 1
from 1
africa 1
and 1
if 1
their 1
increase 1
do 1
no 1
other 1
good 1
it 1
will 1
do 1
away 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
the 1
argument 1
that 1
god 1
cursed 1
ham 1
and 1
therefore 1
american 1
slavery 1
is 1
right 1
if 1
the 1
lineal 1
descendants 1
of 1
ham 1
are 1
alone 1
to 1
be 1
scripturally 1
enslaved 1
it 1
is 1
certain 1
that 1
slavery 1
at 1
the 1
south 1
must 1
soon 1
become 1
unscriptural 1
for 1
thousands 1
are 1
ushered 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
annually 1
who 1
like 1
myself 1
owe 1
their 1
existence 1
to 1
white 1
fathers 1
and 1
those 1
fathers 1
most 1
frequently 1
their 1
own 1
masters 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
two 1
masters 1
my 1
first 1
master 1
s 1
name 1
was 1
anthony 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
remember 1
his 1
first 1
name 1
he 1
was 1
generally 1
called 1
captain 1
anthony 1
a 1
title 1
which 1
i 1
presume 1
he 1
acquired 1
by 1
sailing 1
a 1
craft 1
on 1
the 1
chesapeake 1
bay 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
considered 1
a 1
rich 1
slaveholder 1
he 1
owned 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
farms 1
and 1
about 1
thirty 1
slaves 1
his 1
farms 1
and 1
slaves 1
were 1
under 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
an 1
overseer 1
the 1
overseer 1
s 1
name 1
was 1
plummer 1
mr 1
plummer 1
was 1
a 1
miserable 1
drunkard 1
a 1
profane 1
swearer 1
and 1
a 1
savage 1
monster 1
he 1
always 1
went 1
armed 1
with 1
a 1
cowskin 1
and 1
a 1
heavy 1
cudgel 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
him 1
to 1
cut 1
and 1
slash 1
the 1
women 1
s 1
heads 1
so 1
horribly 1
that 1
even 1
master 1
would 1
be 1
enraged 1
at 1
his 1
cruelty 1
and 1
would 1
threaten 1
to 1
whip 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
mind 1
himself 1
master 1
however 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
humane 1
slaveholder 1
it 1
required 1
extraordinary 1
barbarity 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
an 1
overseer 1
to 1
affect 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
cruel 1
man 1
hardened 1
by 1
a 1
long 1
life 1
of 1
slaveholding 1
he 1
would 1
at 1
times 1
seem 1
to 1
take 1
great 1
pleasure 1
in 1
whipping 1
a 1
slave 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
been 1
awakened 1
at 1
the 1
dawn 1
of 1
day 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
heart 1
rending 1
shrieks 1
of 1
an 1
own 1
aunt 1
of 1
mine 1
whom 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
tie 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
joist 1
and 1
whip 1
upon 1
her 1
naked 1
back 1
till 1
she 1
was 1
literally 1
covered 1
with 1
blood 1
no 1
words 1
no 1
tears 1
no 1
prayers 1
from 1
his 1
gory 1
victim 1
seemed 1
to 1
move 1
his 1
iron 1
heart 1
from 1
its 1
bloody 1
purpose 1
the 1
louder 1
she 1
screamed 1
the 1
harder 1
he 1
whipped 1
and 1
where 1
the 1
blood 1
ran 1
fastest 1
there 1
he 1
whipped 1
longest 1
he 1
would 1
whip 1
her 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
scream 1
and 1
whip 1
her 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
hush 1
and 1
not 1
until 1
overcome 1
by 1
fatigue 1
would 1
he 1
cease 1
to 1
swing 1
the 1
blood 1
clotted 1
cowskin 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
ever 1
witnessed 1
this 1
horrible 1
exhibition 1
i 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
child 1
but 1
i 1
well 1
remember 1
it 1
i 1
never 1
shall 1
forget 1
it 1
whilst 1
i 1
remember 1
any 1
thing 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
series 1
of 1
such 1
outrages 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
doomed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
witness 1
and 1
a 1
participant 1
it 1
struck 1
me 1
with 1
awful 1
force 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
blood 1
stained 1
gate 1
the 1
entrance 1
to 1
the 1
hell 1
of 1
slavery 1
through 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
pass 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
terrible 1
spectacle 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
commit 1
to 1
paper 1
the 1
feelings 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
beheld 1
it 1
this 1
occurrence 1
took 1
place 1
very 1
soon 1
after 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
and 1
under 1
the 1
following 1
circumstances 1
aunt 1
hester 1
went 1
out 1
one 1
night 1
where 1
or 1
for 1
what 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
and 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
absent 1
when 1
my 1
master 1
desired 1
her 1
presence 1
he 1
had 1
ordered 1
her 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
evenings 1
and 1
warned 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
never 1
let 1
him 1
catch 1
her 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
paying 1
attention 1
to 1
her 1
belonging 1
to 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
s 1
name 1
was 1
ned 1
roberts 1
generally 1
called 1
lloyd 1
s 1
ned 1
why 1
master 1
was 1
so 1
careful 1
of 1
her 1
may 1
be 1
safely 1
left 1
to 1
conjecture 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
woman 1
of 1
noble 1
form 1
and 1
of 1
graceful 1
proportions 1
having 1
very 1
few 1
equals 1
and 1
fewer 1
superiors 1
in 1
personal 1
appearance 1
among 1
the 1
colored 1
or 1
white 1
women 1
of 1
our 1
neighborhood 1
aunt 1
hester 1
had 1
not 1
only 1
disobeyed 1
his 1
orders 1
in 1
going 1
out 1
but 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
lloyd 1
s 1
ned 1
which 1
circumstance 1
i 1
found 1
from 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
while 1
whipping 1
her 1
was 1
the 1
chief 1
offence 1
had 1
he 1
been 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
pure 1
morals 1
himself 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
thought 1
interested 1
in 1
protecting 1
the 1
innocence 1
of 1
my 1
aunt 1
but 1
those 1
who 1
knew 1
him 1
will 1
not 1
suspect 1
him 1
of 1
any 1
such 1
virtue 1
before 1
he 1
commenced 1
whipping 1
aunt 1
hester 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
stripped 1
her 1
from 1
neck 1
to 1
waist 1
leaving 1
her 1
neck 1
shoulders 1
and 1
back 1
entirely 1
naked 1
he 1
then 1
told 1
her 1
to 1
cross 1
her 1
hands 1
calling 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
a 1
d 1
d 1
b 1
h 1
after 1
crossing 1
her 1
hands 1
he 1
tied 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
rope 1
and 1
led 1
her 1
to 1
a 1
stool 1
under 1
a 1
large 1
hook 1
in 1
the 1
joist 1
put 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
he 1
made 1
her 1
get 1
upon 1
the 1
stool 1
and 1
tied 1
her 1
hands 1
to 1
the 1
hook 1
she 1
now 1
stood 1
fair 1
for 1
his 1
infernal 1
purpose 1
her 1
arms 1
were 1
stretched 1
up 1
at 1
their 1
full 1
length 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
ends 1
of 1
her 1
toes 1
he 1
then 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
now 1
you 1
d 1
d 1
b 1
h 1
i 1
ll 1
learn 1
you 1
how 1
to 1
disobey 1
my 1
orders 1
and 1
after 1
rolling 1
up 1
his 1
sleeves 1
he 1
commenced 1
to 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
heavy 1
cowskin 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
warm 1
red 1
blood 1
amid 1
heart 1
rending 1
shrieks 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
horrid 1
oaths 1
from 1
him 1
came 1
dripping 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
terrified 1
and 1
horror 1
stricken 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
that 1
i 1
hid 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
closet 1
and 1
dared 1
not 1
venture 1
out 1
till 1
long 1
after 1
the 1
bloody 1
transaction 1
was 1
over 1
i 1
expected 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
my 1
turn 1
next 1
it 1
was 1

to 1

was 1
a 1
profane 1

was 1
enough 1
to 1

both 1

fellow 1
slaves 1
were 1
peculiarly 1
enthusiastic 1
while 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
they 1
would 1
make 1
the 1
dense 1
old 1
woods 1
for 1
miles 1
around 1
reverberate 1
with 1
their 1
wild 1
songs 1
revealing 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
highest 1
joy 1
and 1
the 1
deepest 1
sadness 1
they 1
would 1
compose 1
and 1
sing 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
along 1
consulting 1
neither 1

frequently 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
they 1
would 1
sometimes 1
sing 1
the 1
most 1
pathetic 1
sentiment 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
rapturous 1
tone 1

the 1
most 1

into 1
all 1
of 1
their 1
songs 1

would 1
manage 1
to 1
weave 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
house 1

would 1
they 1
do 1
this 1
when 1
leaving 1

they 1
would 1
then 1
sing 1
most 1
exultingly 1
the 1
following 1
words 1

yea 1
o 1
yea 1
o 1
this 1
they 1
would 1
sing 1
as 1
a 1
chorus 1
to 1
words 1
which 1
to 1
many 1
would 1
seem 1
unmeaning 1
jargon 1
but 1
which 1
nevertheless 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
meaning 1
to 1
themselves 1
i 1
have 1
sometimes 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
mere 1
hearing 1
of 1
those 1
songs 1
would 1
do 1
more 1
to 1
impress 1
some 1
minds 1
with 1
the 1
horrible 1
character 1
of 1
slavery 1
than 1
the 1
reading 1
of 1
whole 1
volumes 1
of 1
philosophy 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
could 1
do 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
when 1
a 1
slave 1
understand 1
the 1
deep 1
meaning 1
of 1
those 1
rude 1
and 1
apparently 1
incoherent 1
songs 1
i 1
was 1
myself 1
within 1
the 1
circle 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
neither 1
saw 1
nor 1
heard 1
as 1
those 1
without 1
might 1
see 1
and 1
hear 1
they 1
told 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
woe 1
which 1
was 1
then 1
altogether 1
beyond 1
my 1
feeble 1
comprehension 1
they 1
were 1
tones 1
loud 1
long 1
and 1
deep 1
they 1
breathed 1
the 1
prayer 1
and 1
complaint 1
of 1
souls 1
boiling 1
over 1
with 1
the 1
bitterest 1
anguish 1
every 1
tone 1
was 1
a 1
testimony 1
against 1
slavery 1
and 1
a 1
prayer 1
to 1
god 1
for 1
deliverance 1
from 1
chains 1
the 1
hearing 1
of 1
those 1
wild 1
notes 1
always 1
depressed 1
my 1
spirit 1
and 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
ineffable 1
sadness 1
i 1
have 1
frequently 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
tears 1
while 1
hearing 1
them 1
the 1
mere 1
recurrence 1
to 1
those 1
songs 1
even 1
now 1
afflicts 1
me 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
am 1
writing 1
these 1
lines 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
feeling 1
has 1
already 1
found 1
its 1
way 1
down 1
my 1
cheek 1
to 1
those 1
songs 1
i 1
trace 1
my 1
first 1
glimmering 1
conception 1
of 1
the 1
dehumanizing 1
character 1
of 1
slavery 1
i 1
can 1
never 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
that 1
conception 1
those 1
songs 1
still 1
follow 1
me 1
to 1
deepen 1
my 1
hatred 1
of 1
slavery 1
and 1
quicken 1
my 1
sympathies 1
for 1
my 1
brethren 1
in 1
bonds 1
if 1
any 1
one 1
wishes 1
to 1
be 1
impressed 1
with 1
the 1
soul 1
killing 1
effects 1
of 1
slavery 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
to 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
and 1
on 1
allowance 1
day 1
place 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
pine 1
woods 1
and 1
there 1
let 1
him 1
in 1
silence 1
analyze 1
the 1
sounds 1
that 1
shall 1
pass 1
through 1
the 1
chambers 1
of 1
his 1
soul 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
thus 1
impressed 1
it 1
will 1
only 1
be 1
because 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
flesh 1
in 1
his 1
obdurate 1
heart 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
been 1
utterly 1
astonished 1
since 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
north 1
to 1
find 1
persons 1
who 1
could 1
speak 1
of 1
the 1
singing 1
among 1
slaves 1
as 1
evidence 1
of 1
their 1
contentment 1
and 1
happiness 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
conceive 1
of 1
a 1
greater 1
mistake 1
slaves 1
sing 1
most 1
when 1
they 1
are 1
most 1
unhappy 1
the 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
slave 1
represent 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
relieved 1
by 1
them 1
only 1
as 1
an 1
aching 1
heart 1
is 1
relieved 1
by 1
its 1
tears 1
at 1
least 1
such 1
is 1
my 1
experience 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
sung 1
to 1
drown 1
my 1
sorrow 1
but 1
seldom 1
to 1
express 1
my 1
happiness 1
crying 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
singing 1
for 1
joy 1
were 1
alike 1
uncommon 1
to 1
me 1
while 1
in 1
the 1
jaws 1
of 1
slavery 1
the 1
singing 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
cast 1
away 1
upon 1
a 1
desolate 1
island 1
might 1
be 1
as 1
appropriately 1
considered 1
as 1
evidence 1
of 1
contentment 1
and 1
happiness 1
as 1
the 1
singing 1
of 1
a 1
slave 1
the 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
are 1
prompted 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
emotion 1

iii 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
kept 1
a 1
large 1
and 1
finely 1
cultivated 1
garden 1
which 1
afforded 1
almost 1
constant 1
employment 1
for 1
four 1
men 1
besides 1
the 1
chief 1
gardener 1
mr 1
m 1
durmond 1
this 1
garden 1
was 1
probably 1
the 1
greatest 1
attraction 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
during 1
the 1
summer 1
months 1
people 1
came 1
from 1
far 1
and 1
near 1
from 1
baltimore 1
easton 1
and 1
annapolis 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
it 1
abounded 1
in 1
fruits 1
of 1
almost 1
every 1
description 1
from 1
the 1
hardy 1
apple 1
of 1
the 1
north 1
to 1
the 1
delicate 1
orange 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
this 1
garden 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
least 1
source 1
of 1
trouble 1
on 1
the 1
plantation 1
its 1
excellent 1
fruit 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
temptation 1
to 1
the 1
hungry 1
swarms 1
of 1
boys 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
older 1
slaves 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
colonel 1
few 1
of 1
whom 1
had 1
the 1
virtue 1
or 1
the 1
vice 1
to 1
resist 1
it 1
scarcely 1
a 1
day 1
passed 1
during 1
the 1
summer 1
but 1
that 1
some 1
slave 1
had 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
lash 1
for 1
stealing 1
fruit 1
the 1
colonel 1
had 1
to 1
resort 1
to 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
stratagems 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
slaves 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
the 1
last 1
and 1
most 1
successful 1
one 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
tarring 1
his 1
fence 1
all 1
around 1
after 1
which 1
if 1
a 1
slave 1
was 1
caught 1
with 1
any 1
tar 1
upon 1
his 1
person 1
it 1
was 1
deemed 1
sufficient 1
proof 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
either 1
been 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
or 1
had 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
in 1
either 1
case 1
he 1
was 1
severely 1
whipped 1
by 1
the 1
chief 1
gardener 1
this 1
plan 1
worked 1
well 1
the 1
slaves 1
became 1
as 1
fearful 1
of 1
tar 1
as 1
of 1
the 1
lash 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
realize 1
the 1
impossibility 1
of 1
touching 1
tar 1
without 1
being 1
defiled 1
the 1
colonel 1
also 1
kept 1
a 1
splendid 1
riding 1
equipage 1
his 1
stable 1
and 1
carriage 1
house 1
presented 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
some 1
of 1
our 1
large 1
city 1
livery 1
establishments 1
his 1
horses 1
were 1
of 1
the 1
finest 1
form 1
and 1
noblest 1
blood 1
his 1
carriage 1
house 1
contained 1
three 1
splendid 1
coaches 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
gigs 1
besides 1
dearborns 1
and 1
barouches 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
fashionable 1
style 1
this 1
establishment 1
was 1
under 1
the 1
care 1
of 1

young 1
barney 1

was 1
their 1
sole 1
work 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
an 1
easy 1
employment 1
for 1
in 1
nothing 1
was 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
more 1
particular 1
than 1
in 1
the 1
management 1
of 1
his 1
horses 1
the 1
slightest 1
inattention 1
to 1
these 1
was 1
unpardonable 1
and 1
was 1
visited 1
upon 1
those 1
under 1
whose 1
care 1
they 1
were 1
placed 1
with 1
the 1
severest 1
punishment 1
no 1
excuse 1
could 1
shield 1
them 1
if 1
the 1
colonel 1
only 1
suspected 1
any 1
want 1
of 1
attention 1
to 1
his 1
horses 1
a 1
supposition 1
which 1
he 1
frequently 1
indulged 1
and 1
one 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
made 1
the 1
office 1
of 1
old 1
and 1
young 1
barney 1
a 1
very 1
trying 1
one 1
they 1
never 1
knew 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
safe 1
from 1
punishment 1
they 1
were 1
frequently 1
whipped 1
when 1
least 1
deserving 1
and 1
escaped 1
whipping 1
when 1
most 1
deserving 1
it 1
every 1
thing 1
depended 1
upon 1
the 1
looks 1
of 1
the 1
horses 1
and 1
the 1
state 1
of 1

mind 1
when 1
his 1
horses 1
were 1
brought 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
use 1
if 1
a 1
horse 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
fast 1
enough 1
or 1
hold 1
his 1
head 1
high 1
enough 1
it 1
was 1
owing 1
to 1
some 1
fault 1
of 1
his 1
keepers 1
it 1
was 1
painful 1
to 1
stand 1
near 1
the 1
stable 1

and 1
hear 1
the 1
various 1
complaints 1

not 1
brook 1
any 1
contradiction 1
from 1
a 1
slave 1
when 1
he 1
spoke 1
a 1
slave 1
must 1
stand 1
listen 1
and 1
tremble 1
and 1
such 1
was 1
literally 1
the 1
case 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
make 1
old 1
barney 1
a 1
man 1
between 1
fifty 1
and 1
sixty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
uncover 1
his 1
bald 1
head 1
kneel 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
cold 1
damp 1
ground 1
and 1
receive 1
upon 1
his 1
naked 1
and 1
toil 1
worn 1
shoulders 1
more 1
than 1
thirty 1
lashes 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
had 1
three 1
sons 1
edward 1
murray 1
and 1
daniel 1
and 1
three 1
sons 1
in 1
law 1
mr 1
winder 1
mr 1
nicholson 1
and 1
mr 1
lowndes 1
all 1
of 1
these 1
lived 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
house 1
farm 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
luxury 1
of 1
whipping 1
the 1
servants 1
when 1
they 1
pleased 1
from 1
old 1
barney 1
down 1
to 1
william 1
wilkes 1
the 1
coach 1
driver 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
winder 1
make 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
servants 1
stand 1
off 1
from 1
him 1
a 1
suitable 1
distance 1
to 1
be 1
touched 1
with 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
at 1
every 1
stroke 1
raise 1
great 1
ridges 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
to 1
describe 1
the 1
wealth 1
of 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
would 1
be 1
almost 1
equal 1
to 1
describing 1
the 1
riches 1
of 1
job 1
he 1
kept 1
from 1
ten 1
to 1
fifteen 1
house 1
servants 1
he 1
was 1
said 1
to 1
own 1
a 1
thousand 1
slaves 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
this 1
estimate 1
quite 1
within 1
the 1
truth 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
owned 1
so 1
many 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
them 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
them 1
nor 1
did 1
all 1
the 1
slaves 1
of 1
the 1
out 1
farms 1
know 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
reported 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
while 1
riding 1
along 1
the 1
road 1
one 1
day 1
he 1
met 1
a 1
colored 1
man 1
and 1
addressed 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
usual 1
manner 1
of 1
speaking 1
to 1
colored 1
people 1
on 1
the 1
public 1
highways 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
well 1
boy 1
whom 1
do 1
you 1
belong 1
to 1
to 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
replied 1
the 1
slave 1
well 1
does 1
the 1
colonel 1
treat 1
you 1
well 1
no 1
sir 1
was 1
the 1
ready 1
reply 1
what 1
does 1
he 1
work 1
you 1
too 1
hard 1
yes 1
sir 1
well 1
don 1
t 1
he 1
give 1
you 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
yes 1
sir 1
he 1
gives 1
me 1
enough 1
such 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
colonel 1
after 1
ascertaining 1
where 1
the 1
slave 1
belonged 1
rode 1
on 1
the 1
man 1
also 1
went 1
on 1
about 1
his 1
business 1
not 1
dreaming 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
conversing 1
with 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
thought 1
said 1
and 1
heard 1
nothing 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
until 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
weeks 1
afterwards 1
the 1
poor 1
man 1
was 1
then 1
informed 1
by 1
his 1
overseer 1
that 1
for 1
having 1
found 1
fault 1
with 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
to 1
be 1
sold 1
to 1
a 1
georgia 1
trader 1
he 1
was 1
immediately 1
chained 1
and 1
handcuffed 1
and 1
thus 1
without 1
a 1
moment 1
s 1
warning 1
he 1
was 1
snatched 1
away 1
and 1
forever 1
sundered 1
from 1
his 1
family 1
and 1
friends 1
by 1
a 1
hand 1
more 1
unrelenting 1
than 1
death 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
penalty 1
of 1
telling 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
telling 1
the 1
simple 1
truth 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
plain 1
questions 1
it 1
is 1
partly 1
in 1
consequence 1
of 1
such 1
facts 1
that 1
slaves 1
when 1
inquired 1
of 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
condition 1
and 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
their 1
masters 1
almost 1
universally 1
say 1
they 1
are 1
contented 1
and 1
that 1
their 1
masters 1
are 1
kind 1
the 1
slaveholders 1
have 1
been 1
known 1
to 1
send 1
in 1
spies 1
among 1
their 1
slaves 1
to 1
ascertain 1
their 1
views 1
and 1
feelings 1
in 1
regard 1
to 1
their 1
condition 1
the 1
frequency 1
of 1
this 1
has 1
had 1
the 1
effect 1
to 1
establish 1
among 1
the 1
slaves 1
the 1
maxim 1
that 1
a 1
still 1
tongue 1
makes 1
a 1
wise 1
head 1
they 1
suppress 1
the 1
truth 1
rather 1
than 1
take 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
telling 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
so 1
doing 1
prove 1
themselves 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
family 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
any 1
thing 1
to 1
say 1
of 1
their 1
masters 1
it 1
is 1
generally 1
in 1
their 1
masters 1
favor 1
especially 1
when 1
speaking 1
to 1
an 1
untried 1
man 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
frequently 1
asked 1
when 1
a 1
slave 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
kind 1
master 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
remember 1
ever 1
to 1
have 1
given 1
a 1
negative 1
answer 1
nor 1
did 1
i 1
in 1
pursuing 1
this 1
course 1
consider 1
myself 1
as 1
uttering 1
what 1
was 1
absolutely 1
false 1
for 1
i 1
always 1
measured 1
the 1
kindness 1
of 1
my 1
master 1
by 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
kindness 1
set 1
up 1
among 1
slaveholders 1
around 1
us 1
moreover 1
slaves 1
are 1
like 1
other 1
people 1
and 1
imbibe 1
prejudices 1
quite 1
common 1
to 1
others 1
they 1
think 1
their 1
own 1
better 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
others 1
many 1
under 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
this 1
prejudice 1
think 1
their 1
own 1
masters 1
are 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
masters 1
of 1
other 1
slaves 1
and 1
this 1
too 1
in 1
some 1
cases 1
when 1
the 1
very 1
reverse 1
is 1
true 1
indeed 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
uncommon 1
for 1
slaves 1
even 1
to 1
fall 1
out 1
and 1
quarrel 1
among 1
themselves 1
about 1
the 1
relative 1
goodness 1
of 1
their 1
masters 1
each 1
contending 1
for 1
the 1
superior 1
goodness 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
over 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
same 1
time 1
they 1
mutually 1
execrate 1
their 1
masters 1
when 1
viewed 1
separately 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
on 1
our 1
plantation 1
when 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
slaves 1
met 1
the 1
slaves 1
of 1
jacob 1
jepson 1
they 1
seldom 1
parted 1
without 1
a 1
quarrel 1
about 1
their 1
masters 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
slaves 1
contending 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
richest 1
and 1
mr 1
jepson 1
s 1
slaves 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
smartest 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
slaves 1
would 1
boast 1
his 1
ability 1
to 1
buy 1
and 1
sell 1
jacob 1
jepson 1
mr 1
jepson 1
s 1
slaves 1
would 1
boast 1
his 1
ability 1
to 1
whip 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
these 1
quarrels 1
would 1
almost 1
always 1
end 1
in 1
a 1
fight 1
between 1
the 1
parties 1
and 1
those 1
that 1
whipped 1
were 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
gained 1
the 1
point 1
at 1
issue 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
greatness 1
of 1
their 1
masters 1
was 1
transferable 1
to 1
themselves 1
it 1
was 1
considered 1
as 1
being 1
bad 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
s 1
slave 1
was 1
deemed 1
a 1
disgrace 1
indeed 1
chapter 1
iv 1
mr 1
hopkins 1
remained 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
of 1
overseer 1
why 1
his 1
career 1
was 1
so 1
short 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
but 1
suppose 1
he 1
lacked 1
the 1
necessary 1
severity 1
to 1
suit 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
mr 1
hopkins 1
was 1
succeeded 1
by 1
mr 1
austin 1
gore 1
a 1
man 1
possessing 1
in 1
an 1
eminent 1
degree 1
all 1
those 1
traits 1
of 1
character 1
indispensable 1
to 1
what 1
is 1
called 1
a 1
first 1
rate 1
overseer 1
mr 1
gore 1
had 1
served 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
in 1
the 1
capacity 1
of 1
overseer 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
out 1
farms 1
and 1
had 1
shown 1
himself 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
high 1
station 1
of 1
overseer 1
upon 1
the 1
home 1
or 1
great 1
house 1
farm 1
mr 1
gore 1
was 1
proud 1
ambitious 1
and 1
persevering 1
he 1
was 1
artful 1
cruel 1
and 1
obdurate 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
the 1
man 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
the 1
place 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
it 1
afforded 1
scope 1
for 1
the 1
full 1
exercise 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
powers 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
perfectly 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
could 1
torture 1
the 1
slightest 1
look 1
word 1
or 1
gesture 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1

impudence 1

would 1
treat 1
it 1
accordingly 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
no 1

back 1

himself 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
wrongfully 1
accused 1
mr 1
gore 1
acted 1
fully 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
maxim 1
laid 1
down 1
by 1
slaveholders 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
that 1
a 1
dozen 1
slaves 1
should 1
suffer 1
under 1
the 1
lash 1
than 1
that 1
the 1
overseer 1
should 1
be 1
convicted 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
slaves 1
of 1
having 1
been 1
at 1
fault 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
innocent 1
a 1
slave 1
might 1
be 1
it 1
availed 1
him 1
nothing 1
when 1
accused 1
by 1
mr 1
gore 1
of 1
any 1
misdemeanor 1
to 1
be 1
accused 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
convicted 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
convicted 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
punished 1
the 1
one 1
always 1
following 1
the 1
other 1
with 1
immutable 1
certainty 1
to 1
escape 1
punishment 1
was 1
to 1
escape 1
accusation 1
and 1
few 1
slaves 1
had 1
the 1
fortune 1
to 1
do 1
either 1
under 1
the 1
overseership 1
of 1
mr 1
gore 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
proud 1
enough 1
to 1
demand 1
the 1
most 1
debasing 1
homage 1
of 1
the 1
slave 1
and 1
quite 1
servile 1
enough 1
to 1
crouch 1
himself 1
at 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
the 1
master 1
he 1
was 1
ambitious 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
contented 1
with 1
nothing 1
short 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
rank 1
of 1
overseers 1
and 1
persevering 1
enough 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
height 1
of 1
his 1
ambition 1
he 1
was 1
cruel 1
enough 1
to 1
inflict 1
the 1
severest 1
punishment 1
artful 1
enough 1
to 1
descend 1
to 1
the 1
lowest 1
trickery 1
and 1
obdurate 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
insensible 1
to 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
a 1
reproving 1
conscience 1
he 1
was 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
overseers 1
the 1
most 1
dreaded 1
by 1
the 1
slaves 1
his 1
presence 1
was 1
painful 1
his 1
eye 1
flashed 1
confusion 1
and 1
seldom 1
was 1
his 1
sharp 1
shrill 1
voice 1
heard 1
without 1
producing 1
horror 1
and 1
trembling 1
in 1
their 1
ranks 1
mr 1
gore 1
was 1
a 1
grave 1
man 1
and 1
though 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
he 1
indulged 1
in 1
no 1
jokes 1
said 1
no 1
funny 1
words 1
seldom 1
smiled 1
his 1
words 1
were 1
in 1
perfect 1
keeping 1
with 1
his 1
looks 1
and 1
his 1
looks 1
were 1
in 1
perfect 1
keeping 1
with 1
his 1
words 1
overseers 1
will 1
sometimes 1
indulge 1
in 1
a 1
witty 1
word 1
even 1
with 1
the 1
slaves 1
not 1
so 1
with 1
mr 1
gore 1
he 1
spoke 1
but 1
to 1
command 1
and 1
commanded 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
obeyed 1
he 1
dealt 1
sparingly 1
with 1
his 1
words 1
and 1
bountifully 1
with 1
his 1
whip 1
never 1
using 1
the 1
former 1
where 1
the 1
latter 1
would 1
answer 1
as 1
well 1
when 1
he 1
whipped 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
from 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
duty 1
and 1
feared 1
no 1
consequences 1
he 1
did 1
nothing 1
reluctantly 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
disagreeable 1
always 1
at 1
his 1
post 1
never 1
inconsistent 1
he 1
never 1
promised 1
but 1
to 1
fulfil 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
word 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
inflexible 1
firmness 1
and 1
stone 1
like 1
coolness 1
his 1
savage 1
barbarity 1
was 1
equalled 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
consummate 1
coolness 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
committed 1
the 1
grossest 1
and 1
most 1
savage 1
deeds 1
upon 1
the 1
slaves 1
under 1
his 1
charge 1
mr 1
gore 1
once 1
undertook 1
to 1
whip 1
one 1
of 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
slaves 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
demby 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
demby 1
but 1
few 1
stripes 1
when 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
scourging 1
he 1
ran 1
and 1
plunged 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
creek 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
at 1
the 1
depth 1
of 1
his 1
shoulders 1
refusing 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
mr 1
gore 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
three 1
calls 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
third 1
call 1
he 1
would 1
shoot 1
him 1
the 1
first 1
call 1
was 1
given 1
demby 1
made 1
no 1
response 1
but 1
stood 1
his 1
ground 1
the 1
second 1
and 1
third 1
calls 1
were 1
given 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
result 1
mr 1
gore 1
then 1
without 1
consultation 1
or 1
deliberation 1
with 1
any 1
one 1
not 1
even 1
giving 1
demby 1
an 1
additional 1
call 1
raised 1
his 1
musket 1
to 1
his 1
face 1
taking 1
deadly 1
aim 1
at 1
his 1
standing 1
victim 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
poor 1
demby 1
was 1
no 1
more 1
his 1
mangled 1
body 1
sank 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
and 1
blood 1
and 1
brains 1
marked 1
the 1
water 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
stood 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
horror 1
flashed 1
through 1
every 1
soul 1
upon 1
the 1
plantation 1
excepting 1
mr 1
gore 1
he 1
alone 1
seemed 1
cool 1
and 1
collected 1
he 1
was 1
asked 1
by 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
and 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
why 1
he 1
resorted 1
to 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
expedient 1
his 1
reply 1
was 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
remember 1
that 1
demby 1
had 1
become 1
unmanageable 1
he 1
was 1
setting 1
a 1
dangerous 1
example 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
slaves 1
one 1
which 1
if 1
suffered 1
to 1
pass 1
without 1
some 1
such 1
demonstration 1
on 1
his 1
part 1
would 1
finally 1
lead 1
to 1
the 1
total 1
subversion 1
of 1
all 1
rule 1
and 1
order 1
upon 1
the 1
plantation 1
he 1
argued 1
that 1
if 1
one 1
slave 1
refused 1
to 1
be 1
corrected 1
and 1
escaped 1
with 1
his 1
life 1
the 1
other 1
slaves 1
would 1
soon 1
copy 1
the 1
example 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
which 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
freedom 1
of 1
the 1
slaves 1
and 1
the 1
enslavement 1
of 1
the 1
whites 1
mr 1
gore 1
s 1
defence 1
was 1
satisfactory 1
he 1
was 1
continued 1
in 1
his 1
station 1
as 1
overseer 1
upon 1
the 1
home 1
plantation 1
his 1
fame 1
as 1
an 1
overseer 1
went 1
abroad 1
his 1
horrid 1
crime 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
submitted 1
to 1
judicial 1
investigation 1
it 1
was 1
committed 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
slaves 1
and 1
they 1
of 1
course 1
could 1
neither 1
institute 1
a 1
suit 1
nor 1
testify 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
thus 1
the 1
guilty 1
perpetrator 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
bloodiest 1
and 1
most 1
foul 1
murders 1
goes 1
unwhipped 1
of 1
justice 1
and 1
uncensured 1
by 1
the 1
community 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
lives 1
mr 1
gore 1
lived 1
in 1
st 1

s 1
talbot 1
county 1

when 1
i 1
left 1
there 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
alive 1
he 1
very 1
probably 1
lives 1
there 1
now 1
and 1
if 1
so 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
then 1
as 1
highly 1
esteemed 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
respected 1
as 1
though 1
his 1
guilty 1
soul 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
stained 1
with 1
his 1
brother 1
s 1
blood 1
i 1
speak 1
advisedly 1
when 1
i 1
say 1
this 1
that 1

a 1
slave 1
or 1
any 1
colored 1
person 1
in 1
talbot 1
county 1
maryland 1
is 1
not 1
treated 1
as 1
a 1
crime 1
either 1
by 1
the 1
courts 1
or 1
the 1
community 1
mr 1

lanman 1
of 1
st 1
michael 1

killed 1
two 1
slaves 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
he 1
killed 1
with 1
a 1
hatchet 1
by 1
knocking 1
his 1
brains 1
out 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
boast 1
of 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
the 1
awful 1
and 1
bloody 1
deed 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
him 1
do 1
so 1
laughingly 1
saying 1
among 1
other 1
things 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
benefactor 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
and 1
that 1
when 1
others 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
relieved 1
of 1
the 1
d 1

niggers 1
the 1
wife 1
of 1
mr 1
giles 1
hicks 1
living 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
where 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
live 1
murdered 1
my 1
wife 1
s 1
cousin 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
between 1
fifteen 1
and 1
sixteen 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
mangling 1
her 1
person 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
manner 1
breaking 1
her 1
nose 1
and 1
breastbone 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
expired 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
afterward 1
she 1
was 1
immediately 1
buried 1
but 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
in 1
her 1
untimely 1
grave 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
before 1
she 1
was 1
taken 1
up 1
and 1
examined 1
by 1
the 1
coroner 1
who 1
decided 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
her 1
death 1
by 1
severe 1
beating 1
the 1
offence 1
for 1
which 1
this 1
girl 1
was 1
thus 1
murdered 1
was 1
this 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
set 1
that 1
night 1
to 1
mind 1
mrs 1
hicks 1
s 1
baby 1
and 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
fell 1
asleep 1
and 1
the 1
baby 1
cried 1
she 1
having 1
lost 1
her 1
rest 1
for 1
several 1
nights 1
previous 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
the 1
crying 1
they 1
were 1
both 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
mrs 1
hicks 1
mrs 1
hicks 1
finding 1
the 1
girl 1
slow 1
to 1
move 1
jumped 1
from 1
her 1
bed 1
seized 1
an 1
oak 1
stick 1
of 1
wood 1
by 1
the 1
fireplace 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
broke 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
nose 1
and 1
breastbone 1
and 1
thus 1
ended 1
her 1
life 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
this 1
most 1
horrid 1
murder 1
produced 1
no 1
sensation 1
in 1
the 1
community 1
it 1
did 1
produce 1
sensation 1
but 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
murderess 1
to 1
punishment 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
warrant 1
issued 1
for 1
her 1
arrest 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
never 1
served 1
thus 1
she 1
escaped 1
not 1
only 1
punishment 1
but 1
even 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
being 1
arraigned 1
before 1
a 1
court 1
for 1
her 1
horrid 1
crime 1
whilst 1
i 1
am 1
detailing 1
bloody 1
deeds 1
which 1
took 1
place 1
during 1
my 1
stay 1
on 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
i 1
will 1
briefly 1
narrate 1
another 1
which 1
occurred 1
about 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
as 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
demby 1
by 1
mr 1
gore 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
slaves 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
spending 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
their 1
nights 1
and 1
sundays 1
in 1
fishing 1
for 1
oysters 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
made 1
up 1
the 1
deficiency 1
of 1
their 1
scanty 1
allowance 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
belonging 1
to 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
while 1
thus 1
engaged 1
happened 1
to 1
get 1
beyond 1
the 1
limits 1
of 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
premises 1
of 1
mr 1
beal 1
bondly 1
at 1
this 1
trespass 1
mr 1
bondly 1
took 1
offence 1
and 1
with 1
his 1
musket 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
blew 1
its 1
deadly 1
contents 1
into 1
the 1
poor 1
old 1
man 1
mr 1
bondly 1
came 1
over 1
to 1
see 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
whether 1
to 1
pay 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
property 1
or 1
to 1
justify 1
himself 1
in 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
this 1
whole 1
fiendish 1
transaction 1
was 1
soon 1
hushed 1
up 1
there 1
was 1
very 1
little 1
said 1
about 1
it 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
nothing 1
done 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
common 1
saying 1
even 1
among 1
little 1
white 1
boys 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
a 1
half 1
cent 1
to 1
kill 1
a 1
nigger 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
cent 1
to 1
bury 1
one 1
chapter 1
v 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
treatment 1
while 1
i 1
lived 1
on 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
similar 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
slave 1
children 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
old 1
enough 1
to 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
and 1
there 1
being 1
little 1
else 1
than 1
field 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
leisure 1
time 1
the 1
most 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
drive 1
up 1
the 1
cows 1
at 1
evening 1
keep 1
the 1
fowls 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
keep 1
the 1
front 1
yard 1
clean 1
and 1
run 1
of 1
errands 1
for 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
s 1
daughter 1
mrs 1
lucretia 1
auld 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
leisure 1
time 1
i 1
spent 1
in 1
helping 1
master 1
daniel 1
lloyd 1
in 1
finding 1
his 1
birds 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
shot 1
them 1
my 1
connection 1
with 1
master 1
daniel 1
was 1
of 1
some 1
advantage 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
became 1
quite 1
attached 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
protector 1
of 1
me 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
allow 1
the 1
older 1
boys 1
to 1
impose 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
would 1
divide 1
his 1
cakes 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
seldom 1
whipped 1
by 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
and 1
suffered 1
little 1
from 1
any 1
thing 1
else 1
than 1
hunger 1
and 1
cold 1
i 1
suffered 1
much 1
from 1
hunger 1
but 1
much 1
more 1
from 1
cold 1
in 1
hottest 1
summer 1
and 1
coldest 1
winter 1
i 1
was 1
kept 1
almost 1
naked 1
no 1
shoes 1
no 1
stockings 1
no 1
jacket 1
no 1
trousers 1
nothing 1
on 1
but 1
a 1
coarse 1
tow 1
linen 1
shirt 1
reaching 1
only 1
to 1
my 1
knees 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
bed 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
perished 1
with 1
cold 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
coldest 1
nights 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
steal 1
a 1
bag 1
which 1
was 1
used 1
for 1
carrying 1
corn 1

the 1
mill 1

bag 1
and 1
there 1

damp 1
clay 1
floor 1

my 1
head 1
in 1
and 1
feet 1
out 1
my 1
feet 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
cracked 1
with 1
the 1
frost 1
that 1
the 1
pen 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
writing 1
might 1
be 1
laid 1
in 1
the 1
gashes 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
regularly 1
allowanced 1
our 1
food 1
was 1
coarse 1
corn 1
meal 1
boiled 1
this 1
was 1
called 1
mush 1
it 1
was 1
put 1
into 1
a 1
large 1
wooden 1
tray 1
or 1
trough 1
and 1
set 1
down 1
upon 1

like 1

many 1

would 1

the 1
mush 1
some 1
with 1
oyster 1
shells 1

secured 1
the 1
best 1
place 1
and 1
few 1
left 1
the 1
trough 1
satisfied 1
i 1
was 1
probably 1
between 1
seven 1
and 1
eight 1
years 1
old 1
when 1
i 1
left 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
i 1
left 1
it 1
with 1
joy 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
the 1
ecstasy 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
received 1
the 1
intelligence 1
that 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
anthony 1
had 1
determined 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
to 1
baltimore 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
mr 1
hugh 1
auld 1
brother 1
to 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
s 1
son 1
in 1
law 1
captain 1
thomas 1
auld 1
i 1
received 1
this 1
information 1
about 1
three 1
days 1
before 1
my 1
departure 1
they 1
were 1
three 1
of 1
the 1
happiest 1
days 1
i 1
ever 1
enjoyed 1
i 1
spent 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
of 1
all 1
these 1
three 1
days 1
in 1
the 1
creek 1
washing 1
off 1
the 1
plantation 1
scurf 1
and 1
preparing 1
myself 1
for 1
my 1
departure 1
the 1
pride 1
of 1
appearance 1
which 1
this 1
would 1
indicate 1
was 1
not 1
my 1
own 1
i 1
spent 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
washing 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
because 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
but 1
because 1
mrs 1
lucretia 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
i 1
must 1
get 1
all 1
the 1
dead 1
skin 1
off 1
my 1
feet 1
and 1
knees 1
before 1
i 1
could 1
go 1
to 1
baltimore 1
for 1
the 1
people 1
in 1
baltimore 1
were 1
very 1
cleanly 1
and 1
would 1
laugh 1
at 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
looked 1
dirty 1
besides 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
trousers 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
put 1
on 1
unless 1
i 1
got 1
all 1
the 1
dirt 1
off 1
me 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
owning 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
trousers 1
was 1
great 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
almost 1
a 1
sufficient 1
motive 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
take 1
off 1
what 1
would 1
be 1
called 1
by 1
pig 1
drovers 1
the 1
mange 1
but 1
the 1
skin 1
itself 1
i 1
went 1
at 1
it 1
in 1
good 1
earnest 1
working 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
reward 1
the 1
ties 1
that 1
ordinarily 1
bind 1
children 1
to 1
their 1
homes 1
were 1
all 1
suspended 1
in 1
my 1
case 1
i 1
found 1
no 1
severe 1
trial 1
in 1
my 1
departure 1
my 1
home 1
was 1
charmless 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
home 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
parting 1
from 1
it 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
feel 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
leaving 1
any 1
thing 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
enjoyed 1
by 1
staying 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
dead 1
my 1
grandmother 1
lived 1
far 1
off 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
seldom 1
saw 1
her 1
i 1
had 1
two 1
sisters 1
and 1
one 1
brother 1
that 1
lived 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
house 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
the 1
early 1
separation 1
of 1
us 1
from 1
our 1
mother 1
had 1
well 1
nigh 1
blotted 1
the 1
fact 1
of 1
our 1
relationship 1
from 1
our 1
memories 1
i 1
looked 1
for 1
home 1
elsewhere 1
and 1
was 1
confident 1
of 1
finding 1
none 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
relish 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
one 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
leaving 1
if 1
however 1
i 1
found 1
in 1
my 1
new 1
home 1
hardship 1
hunger 1
whipping 1
and 1
nakedness 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
consolation 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
escaped 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
by 1
staying 1
having 1
already 1
had 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
taste 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
and 1
having 1
endured 1
them 1
there 1
i 1
very 1
naturally 1
inferred 1
my 1
ability 1
to 1
endure 1
them 1
elsewhere 1
and 1
especially 1
at 1
baltimore 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
feeling 1
about 1
baltimore 1
that 1
is 1
expressed 1
in 1
the 1
proverb 1
that 1
being 1
hanged 1
in 1
england 1
is 1
preferable 1
to 1
dying 1
a 1
natural 1
death 1
in 1
ireland 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
strongest 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
baltimore 1
cousin 1
tom 1
though 1
not 1
fluent 1
in 1
speech 1
had 1
inspired 1
me 1
with 1
that 1
desire 1
by 1
his 1
eloquent 1
description 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
i 1
could 1
never 1
point 1
out 1
any 1
thing 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
house 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
beautiful 1
or 1
powerful 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
something 1
at 1
baltimore 1
far 1
exceeding 1
both 1
in 1
beauty 1
and 1
strength 1
the 1
object 1
which 1
i 1
pointed 1
out 1
to 1
him 1
even 1
the 1
great 1
house 1
itself 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
pictures 1
was 1
far 1
inferior 1
to 1
many 1
buildings 1
in 1
baltimore 1
so 1
strong 1
was 1
my 1
desire 1
that 1
i 1
thought 1
a 1
gratification 1
of 1
it 1
would 1
fully 1
compensate 1
for 1
whatever 1
loss 1
of 1
comforts 1
i 1
should 1
sustain 1
by 1
the 1
exchange 1
i 1
left 1
without 1
a 1
regret 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
highest 1
hopes 1
of 1
future 1
happiness 1
we 1
sailed 1
out 1
of 1
miles 1
river 1
for 1
baltimore 1
on 1
a 1
saturday 1
morning 1
i 1
remember 1
only 1
the 1
day 1
of 1
the 1
week 1
for 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
month 1
nor 1
the 1
months 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
on 1
setting 1
sail 1
i 1
walked 1
aft 1
and 1
gave 1
to 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
what 1
i 1
hoped 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
last 1
look 1
i 1
then 1
placed 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
bows 1
of 1
the 1
sloop 1
and 1
there 1
spent 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
in 1
looking 1
ahead 1
interesting 1
myself 1
in 1
what 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
rather 1
than 1
in 1
things 1
near 1
by 1
or 1
behind 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
of 1
that 1
day 1
we 1
reached 1
annapolis 1
the 1
capital 1
of 1
the 1
state 1
we 1
stopped 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
shore 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
large 1
town 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
and 1
though 1
it 1
would 1
look 1
small 1
compared 1
with 1
some 1
of 1
our 1
new 1
england 1
factory 1
villages 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
a 1
wonderful 1
place 1
for 1
its 1
size 1
more 1
imposing 1
even 1
than 1
the 1
great 1
house 1
farm 1
we 1
arrived 1
at 1
baltimore 1
early 1
on 1
sunday 1
morning 1
landing 1
at 1
smith 1
s 1
wharf 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
bowley 1
s 1
wharf 1
we 1
had 1
on 1
board 1
the 1
sloop 1
a 1
large 1
flock 1
of 1
sheep 1
and 1
after 1
aiding 1
in 1
driving 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
slaughterhouse 1
of 1
mr 1
curtis 1
on 1
louden 1
slater 1
s 1
hill 1
i 1
was 1
conducted 1
by 1
rich 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hands 1
belonging 1
on 1
board 1
of 1
the 1
sloop 1
to 1
my 1
new 1
home 1
in 1
alliciana 1
street 1
near 1
mr 1
gardner 1
s 1
ship 1
yard 1
on 1
fells 1
point 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
auld 1
were 1
both 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
met 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
their 1
little 1
son 1
thomas 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
saw 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
white 1
face 1
beaming 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
kindly 1
emotions 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
my 1
new 1
mistress 1
sophia 1
auld 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
describe 1
the 1
rapture 1
that 1
flashed 1
through 1
my 1
soul 1
as 1
i 1
beheld 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
strange 1
sight 1
to 1
me 1
brightening 1
up 1
my 1
pathway 1
with 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
happiness 1
little 1
thomas 1
was 1
told 1
there 1
was 1
his 1
freddy 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
told 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
little 1
thomas 1
and 1
thus 1
i 1
entered 1
upon 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
my 1
new 1
home 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
cheering 1
prospect 1
ahead 1
i 1
look 1
upon 1
my 1
departure 1
from 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
as 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
events 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
and 1
even 1
quite 1
probable 1
that 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
mere 1
circumstance 1
of 1
being 1
removed 1
from 1
that 1
plantation 1
to 1
baltimore 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
day 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
here 1
seated 1
by 1
my 1
own 1
table 1
in 1
the 1
enjoyment 1
of 1
freedom 1
and 1
the 1
happiness 1
of 1
home 1
writing 1
this 1
narrative 1
been 1
confined 1
in 1
the 1
galling 1
chains 1
of 1
slavery 1
going 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
baltimore 1
laid 1
the 1
foundation 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
gateway 1
to 1
all 1
my 1
subsequent 1
prosperity 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
regarded 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
first 1
plain 1
manifestation 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
providence 1
which 1
has 1
ever 1
since 1
attended 1
me 1
and 1
marked 1
my 1
life 1
with 1
so 1
many 1
favors 1
i 1
regarded 1
the 1
selection 1
of 1
myself 1
as 1
being 1
somewhat 1
remarkable 1
there 1
were 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
slave 1
children 1
that 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
sent 1
from 1
the 1
plantation 1
to 1
baltimore 1
there 1
were 1
those 1
younger 1
those 1
older 1
and 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
age 1
i 1
was 1
chosen 1
from 1
among 1
them 1
all 1
and 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
last 1
and 1
only 1
choice 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
deemed 1
superstitious 1
and 1
even 1
egotistical 1
in 1
regarding 1
this 1
event 1
as 1
a 1
special 1
interposition 1
of 1
divine 1
providence 1
in 1
my 1
favor 1
but 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
false 1
to 1
the 1
earliest 1
sentiments 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
if 1
i 1
suppressed 1
the 1
opinion 1
i 1
prefer 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
myself 1
even 1
at 1
the 1
hazard 1
of 1
incurring 1
the 1
ridicule 1
of 1
others 1
rather 1
than 1
to 1
be 1
false 1
and 1
incur 1
my 1

my 1
earliest 1
recollection 1
i 1
date 1
the 1
entertainment 1
of 1
a 1
deep 1
conviction 1
that 1
slavery 1
would 1
not 1
always 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
hold 1
me 1
within 1
its 1
foul 1
embrace 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
darkest 1
hours 1
of 1
my 1
career 1
in 1
slavery 1
this 1
living 1

of 1
faith 1
and 1
spirit 1
of 1
hope 1
departed 1
not 1
from 1
me 1
but 1
remained 1
like 1
ministering 1
angels 1
to 1
cheer 1
me 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
this 1
good 1
spirit 1

my 1
new 1
mistress 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
all 1
she 1
appeared 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
met 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
a 1
woman 1
of 1
the 1
kindest 1
heart 1
and 1
finest 1
feelings 1
she 1
had 1
never 1
had 1
a 1
slave 1
under 1
her 1
control 1
previously 1
to 1
myself 1
and 1
prior 1
to 1
her 1
marriage 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
dependent 1
upon 1
her 1
own 1
industry 1
for 1
a 1
living 1
she 1
was 1
by 1
trade 1
a 1
weaver 1
and 1
by 1
constant 1
application 1
to 1
her 1
business 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
degree 1
preserved 1
from 1
the 1
blighting 1
and 1
dehumanizing 1
effects 1
of 1
slavery 1
i 1
was 1
utterly 1
astonished 1
at 1
her 1
goodness 1
i 1
scarcely 1
knew 1
how 1
to 1
behave 1
towards 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
entirely 1
unlike 1
any 1
other 1
white 1
woman 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
approach 1
her 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
accustomed 1
to 1
approach 1
other 1
white 1
ladies 1
my 1
early 1
instruction 1
was 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
place 1
the 1
crouching 1
servility 1
usually 1
so 1
acceptable 1
a 1
quality 1
in 1
a 1
slave 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
when 1
manifested 1
toward 1
her 1
her 1
favor 1
was 1
not 1
gained 1
by 1
it 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
disturbed 1
by 1
it 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
deem 1
it 1
impudent 1
or 1
unmannerly 1
for 1
a 1
slave 1
to 1
look 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
the 1
meanest 1
slave 1
was 1
put 1
fully 1
at 1
ease 1
in 1
her 1
presence 1
and 1
none 1
left 1
without 1
feeling 1
better 1
for 1
having 1
seen 1
her 1
her 1
face 1
was 1
made 1
of 1
heavenly 1
smiles 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
of 1
tranquil 1
music 1
but 1
alas 1
this 1
kind 1
heart 1
had 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
to 1
remain 1
such 1
the 1
fatal 1
poison 1
of 1
irresponsible 1
power 1
was 1
already 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
and 1
soon 1
commenced 1
its 1
infernal 1
work 1
that 1
cheerful 1
eye 1
under 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
slavery 1
soon 1
became 1
red 1
with 1
rage 1
that 1
voice 1
made 1
all 1
of 1
sweet 1
accord 1
changed 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
harsh 1
and 1
horrid 1
discord 1
and 1
that 1
angelic 1
face 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
demon 1
very 1
soon 1
after 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
auld 1
she 1
very 1
kindly 1
commenced 1
to 1
teach 1
me 1
the 1
a 1
b 1
c 1
after 1
i 1
had 1
learned 1
this 1
she 1
assisted 1
me 1
in 1
learning 1
to 1
spell 1
words 1
of 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
letters 1
just 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
of 1
my 1
progress 1
mr 1
auld 1
found 1
out 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
forbade 1
mrs 1
auld 1
to 1
instruct 1
me 1
further 1
telling 1
her 1
among 1
other 1
things 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
unlawful 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
unsafe 1
to 1
teach 1
a 1
slave 1
to 1
read 1
to 1
use 1
his 1
own 1
words 1
further 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
give 1
a 1
nigger 1
an 1
inch 1
he 1
will 1
take 1
an 1
ell 1
a 1
nigger 1
should 1
know 1
nothing 1
but 1
to 1
obey 1
his 1
master 1
to 1
do 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
told 1
to 1
do 1
learning 1
would 1
_spoil_ 1
the 1
best 1
nigger 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
now 1
said 1
he 1
if 1
you 1
teach 1
that 1
nigger 1
speaking 1
of 1
myself 1
how 1
to 1
read 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
keeping 1
him 1
it 1
would 1
forever 1
unfit 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
he 1
would 1
at 1
once 1
become 1
unmanageable 1
and 1
of 1
no 1
value 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
as 1
to 1
himself 1
it 1
could 1
do 1
him 1
no 1
good 1
but 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
harm 1
it 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
discontented 1
and 1
unhappy 1
these 1
words 1
sank 1
deep 1
into 1
my 1
heart 1
stirred 1
up 1
sentiments 1
within 1
that 1
lay 1
slumbering 1
and 1
called 1
into 1
existence 1
an 1
entirely 1
new 1
train 1
of 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
special 1
revelation 1
explaining 1
dark 1
and 1
mysterious 1
things 1
with 1
which 1
my 1
youthful 1
understanding 1
had 1
struggled 1
but 1
struggled 1
in 1
vain 1
i 1
now 1
understood 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
most 1
perplexing 1
difficulty 1
to 1
wit 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
s 1
power 1
to 1
enslave 1
the 1
black 1
man 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
grand 1
achievement 1
and 1
i 1
prized 1
it 1
highly 1
from 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
understood 1
the 1
pathway 1
from 1
slavery 1
to 1
freedom 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
what 1
i 1
wanted 1
and 1
i 1
got 1
it 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
when 1
i 1
the 1
least 1
expected 1
it 1
whilst 1
i 1
was 1
saddened 1
by 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
losing 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
my 1
kind 1
mistress 1
i 1
was 1
gladdened 1
by 1
the 1
invaluable 1
instruction 1
which 1
by 1
the 1
merest 1
accident 1
i 1
had 1
gained 1
from 1
my 1
master 1
though 1
conscious 1
of 1
the 1
difficulty 1
of 1
learning 1
without 1
a 1
teacher 1
i 1
set 1
out 1
with 1
high 1
hope 1
and 1
a 1
fixed 1
purpose 1
at 1
whatever 1
cost 1
of 1
trouble 1
to 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
very 1
decided 1
manner 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
strove 1
to 1
impress 1
his 1
wife 1
with 1
the 1
evil 1
consequences 1
of 1
giving 1
me 1
instruction 1
served 1
to 1
convince 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
sensible 1
of 1
the 1
truths 1
he 1
was 1
uttering 1
it 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
best 1
assurance 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
rely 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
confidence 1
on 1
the 1
results 1
which 1
he 1
said 1
would 1
flow 1
from 1
teaching 1
me 1
to 1
read 1
what 1
he 1
most 1
dreaded 1
that 1
i 1
most 1
desired 1
what 1
he 1
most 1
loved 1
that 1
i 1
most 1
hated 1
that 1
which 1
to 1
him 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
evil 1
to 1
be 1
carefully 1
shunned 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
great 1
good 1
to 1
be 1
diligently 1
sought 1
and 1
the 1
argument 1
which 1
he 1
so 1
warmly 1
urged 1
against 1
my 1
learning 1
to 1
read 1
only 1
served 1
to 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
desire 1
and 1
determination 1
to 1
learn 1
in 1
learning 1
to 1
read 1
i 1
owe 1
almost 1
as 1
much 1
to 1
the 1
bitter 1
opposition 1
of 1
my 1
master 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
kindly 1
aid 1
of 1
my 1
mistress 1
i 1
acknowledge 1
the 1
benefit 1
of 1
both 1
i 1
had 1
resided 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
in 1
baltimore 1
before 1
i 1
observed 1
a 1
marked 1
difference 1
in 1
the 1
treatment 1
of 1
slaves 1
from 1
that 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
witnessed 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
a 1
city 1
slave 1
is 1
almost 1
a 1
freeman 1
compared 1
with 1
a 1
slave 1
on 1
the 1
plantation 1
he 1
is 1
much 1
better 1
fed 1
and 1
clothed 1
and 1
enjoys 1
privileges 1
altogether 1
unknown 1
to 1
the 1
slave 1
on 1
the 1
plantation 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
vestige 1
of 1
decency 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
shame 1
that 1
does 1
much 1
to 1
curb 1
and 1
check 1
those 1
outbreaks 1
of 1
atrocious 1
cruelty 1
so 1
commonly 1
enacted 1
upon 1
the 1
plantation 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
desperate 1
slaveholder 1
who 1
will 1
shock 1
the 1
humanity 1
of 1
his 1
non 1
slaveholding 1
neighbors 1
with 1
the 1
cries 1
of 1
his 1
lacerated 1
slave 1
few 1
are 1
willing 1
to 1
incur 1
the 1
odium 1
attaching 1
to 1
the 1
reputation 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
cruel 1
master 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
things 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
known 1
as 1
not 1
giving 1
a 1
slave 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
every 1
city 1
slaveholder 1
is 1
anxious 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
known 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
feeds 1
his 1
slaves 1
well 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
due 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
do 1
give 1
their 1
slaves 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
there 1
are 1
however 1
some 1
painful 1
exceptions 1
to 1
this 1
rule 1
directly 1
opposite 1
to 1
us 1
on 1
philpot 1
street 1
lived 1
mr 1
thomas 1
hamilton 1
he 1
owned 1
two 1
slaves 1
their 1
names 1
were 1
henrietta 1
and 1
mary 1
henrietta 1
was 1
about 1
twenty 1
two 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
mary 1
was 1
about 1
fourteen 1
and 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
mangled 1
and 1
emaciated 1
creatures 1
i 1
ever 1
looked 1
upon 1
these 1
two 1
were 1
the 1
most 1
so 1
his 1
heart 1
must 1
be 1
harder 1
than 1
stone 1
that 1
could 1
look 1
upon 1
these 1
unmoved 1
the 1
head 1
neck 1
and 1
shoulders 1
of 1
mary 1
were 1
literally 1
cut 1
to 1
pieces 1
i 1
have 1
frequently 1
felt 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
found 1
it 1
nearly 1
covered 1
with 1
festering 1
sores 1
caused 1
by 1
the 1
lash 1
of 1
her 1
cruel 1
mistress 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
her 1
master 1
ever 1
whipped 1
her 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
eye 1
witness 1
to 1
the 1
cruelty 1
of 1
mrs 1
hamilton 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
mr 1
hamilton 1
s 1
house 1
nearly 1
every 1
day 1
mrs 1
hamilton 1
used 1
to 1
sit 1
in 1
a 1
large 1
chair 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
cowskin 1
always 1
by 1
her 1
side 1
and 1
scarce 1
an 1
hour 1
passed 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
but 1
was 1
marked 1
by 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
slaves 1
the 1
girls 1
seldom 1
passed 1
her 1
without 1
her 1
saying 1
move 1
faster 1
you 1
_black 1
gip 1
_ 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
giving 1
them 1
a 1
blow 1
with 1
the 1
cowskin 1
over 1
the 1
head 1
or 1
shoulders 1
often 1
drawing 1
the 1
blood 1
she 1
would 1
then 1
say 1
take 1
that 1
you 1
_black 1
gip 1
_ 1
continuing 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
move 1
faster 1
i 1
ll 1
move 1
you 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
cruel 1
lashings 1
to 1
which 1
these 1
slaves 1
were 1
subjected 1
they 1
were 1
kept 1
nearly 1
half 1
starved 1
they 1
seldom 1
knew 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
eat 1
a 1
full 1
meal 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
mary 1
contending 1
with 1
the 1
pigs 1
for 1
the 1
offal 1
thrown 1
into 1
the 1
street 1
so 1
much 1

chapter 1
vii 1
i 1
lived 1
in 1
master 1
hugh 1
s 1
family 1
about 1
seven 1
years 1
during 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
succeeded 1
in 1
learning 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
write 1
in 1
accomplishing 1
this 1
i 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
resort 1
to 1
various 1
stratagems 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
regular 1
teacher 1
my 1
mistress 1
who 1
had 1
kindly 1
commenced 1
to 1
instruct 1
me 1
had 1
in 1
compliance 1
with 1
the 1
advice 1
and 1
direction 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
not 1
only 1
ceased 1
to 1
instruct 1
but 1
had 1
set 1
her 1
face 1
against 1
my 1
being 1
instructed 1
by 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
it 1
is 1
due 1
however 1
to 1
my 1
mistress 1
to 1
say 1
of 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
adopt 1
this 1
course 1
of 1
treatment 1
immediately 1
she 1
at 1
first 1
lacked 1
the 1
depravity 1
indispensable 1
to 1
shutting 1
me 1
up 1
in 1
mental 1
darkness 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
necessary 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
training 1
in 1
the 1
exercise 1
of 1
irresponsible 1
power 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
equal 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
treating 1
me 1
as 1
though 1
i 1
were 1
a 1
brute 1
my 1
mistress 1
was 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
a 1
kind 1
and 1
tender 1
hearted 1
woman 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
simplicity 1
of 1
her 1
soul 1
she 1
commenced 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
went 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
her 1
to 1
treat 1
me 1
as 1
she 1
supposed 1
one 1
human 1
being 1
ought 1
to 1
treat 1
another 1
in 1
entering 1
upon 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
a 1
slaveholder 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
perceive 1
that 1
i 1
sustained 1
to 1
her 1
the 1
relation 1
of 1
a 1
mere 1
chattel 1
and 1
that 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
treat 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
was 1
not 1
only 1
wrong 1
but 1
dangerously 1
so 1
slavery 1
proved 1
as 1
injurious 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
there 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
pious 1
warm 1
and 1
tender 1
hearted 1
woman 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sorrow 1
or 1
suffering 1
for 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
tear 1
she 1
had 1
bread 1
for 1
the 1
hungry 1
clothes 1
for 1
the 1
naked 1
and 1
comfort 1
for 1
every 1
mourner 1
that 1
came 1
within 1
her 1
reach 1
slavery 1
soon 1
proved 1
its 1
ability 1
to 1
divest 1
her 1
of 1
these 1
heavenly 1
qualities 1
under 1
its 1
influence 1
the 1
tender 1
heart 1
became 1
stone 1
and 1
the 1
lamblike 1
disposition 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
tiger 1
like 1
fierceness 1
the 1
first 1
step 1
in 1
her 1
downward 1
course 1
was 1
in 1
her 1
ceasing 1
to 1
instruct 1
me 1
she 1
now 1
commenced 1
to 1
practise 1
her 1
husband 1
s 1
precepts 1
she 1
finally 1
became 1
even 1
more 1
violent 1
in 1
her 1
opposition 1
than 1
her 1
husband 1
himself 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
satisfied 1
with 1
simply 1
doing 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
commanded 1
she 1
seemed 1
anxious 1
to 1
do 1
better 1
nothing 1
seemed 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
more 1
angry 1
than 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
newspaper 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
here 1
lay 1
the 1
danger 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
her 1
rush 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
face 1
made 1
all 1
up 1
of 1
fury 1
and 1
snatch 1
from 1
me 1
a 1
newspaper 1
in 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
fully 1
revealed 1
her 1
apprehension 1
she 1
was 1
an 1
apt 1
woman 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
experience 1
soon 1
demonstrated 1
to 1
her 1
satisfaction 1
that 1
education 1
and 1
slavery 1
were 1
incompatible 1
with 1
each 1
other 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
most 1
narrowly 1
watched 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
separate 1
room 1
any 1
considerable 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
suspected 1
of 1
having 1
a 1
book 1
and 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
called 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
myself 1
all 1
this 1
however 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
the 1
first 1
step 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
mistress 1
in 1
teaching 1
me 1
the 1
alphabet 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
the 1
_inch 1
_ 1
and 1
no 1
precaution 1
could 1
prevent 1
me 1
from 1
taking 1
the 1
_ell 1
_ 1
the 1
plan 1
which 1
i 1
adopted 1
and 1
the 1
one 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
most 1
successful 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
making 1
friends 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
little 1
white 1
boys 1
whom 1
i 1
met 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
as 1
many 1
of 1
these 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
i 1
converted 1
into 1
teachers 1
with 1
their 1
kindly 1
aid 1
obtained 1
at 1
different 1
times 1
and 1
in 1
different 1
places 1
i 1
finally 1
succeeded 1
in 1
learning 1
to 1
read 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
sent 1
of 1
errands 1
i 1
always 1
took 1
my 1
book 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
by 1
going 1
one 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
errand 1
quickly 1
i 1
found 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
lesson 1
before 1
my 1
return 1
i 1
used 1
also 1
to 1
carry 1
bread 1
with 1
me 1
enough 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
always 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
always 1
welcome 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
much 1
better 1
off 1
in 1
this 1
regard 1
than 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
white 1
children 1
in 1
our 1
neighborhood 1
this 1
bread 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
bestow 1
upon 1
the 1
hungry 1
little 1
urchins 1
who 1
in 1
return 1
would 1
give 1
me 1
that 1
more 1
valuable 1
bread 1
of 1
knowledge 1
i 1
am 1
strongly 1
tempted 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
of 1
those 1
little 1
boys 1
as 1
a 1
testimonial 1
of 1
the 1
gratitude 1
and 1
affection 1
i 1
bear 1
them 1
but 1
prudence 1
forbids 1
not 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
injure 1
me 1
but 1
it 1
might 1
embarrass 1
them 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
almost 1
an 1
unpardonable 1
offence 1
to 1
teach 1
slaves 1
to 1
read 1
in 1
this 1
christian 1
country 1
it 1
is 1
enough 1
to 1
say 1
of 1
the 1
dear 1
little 1
fellows 1
that 1
they 1
lived 1
on 1
philpot 1
street 1
very 1
near 1
durgin 1
and 1
bailey 1
s 1
ship 1
yard 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
talk 1
this 1
matter 1
of 1
slavery 1
over 1
with 1
them 1
i 1
would 1
sometimes 1
say 1
to 1
them 1
i 1
wished 1
i 1
could 1
be 1
as 1
free 1
as 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
men 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
free 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
twenty 1
one 1
_but 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
slave 1
for 1
life 1
_ 1
have 1
not 1
i 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
be 1
free 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
these 1
words 1
used 1
to 1
trouble 1
them 1
they 1
would 1
express 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
liveliest 1
sympathy 1
and 1
console 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
something 1
would 1
occur 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
free 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
about 1
twelve 1
years 1
old 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
being 1
_a 1
slave 1
for 1
life_ 1
began 1
to 1
bear 1
heavily 1
upon 1
my 1
heart 1
just 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
got 1
hold 1
of 1
a 1
book 1
entitled 1
the 1
columbian 1
orator 1
every 1
opportunity 1
i 1
got 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
read 1
this 1
book 1
among 1
much 1
of 1
other 1
interesting 1
matter 1
i 1
found 1
in 1
it 1
a 1
dialogue 1
between 1
a 1
master 1
and 1
his 1
slave 1
the 1
slave 1
was 1
represented 1
as 1
having 1
run 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
master 1
three 1
times 1
the 1
dialogue 1
represented 1
the 1
conversation 1
which 1
took 1
place 1
between 1
them 1
when 1
the 1
slave 1
was 1
retaken 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
in 1
this 1
dialogue 1
the 1
whole 1
argument 1
in 1
behalf 1
of 1
slavery 1
was 1
brought 1
forward 1
by 1
the 1
master 1
all 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
disposed 1
of 1
by 1
the 1
slave 1
the 1
slave 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
say 1
some 1
very 1
smart 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
impressive 1
things 1
in 1
reply 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
things 1
which 1
had 1
the 1
desired 1
though 1
unexpected 1
effect 1
for 1
the 1
conversation 1
resulted 1
in 1
the 1
voluntary 1
emancipation 1
of 1
the 1
slave 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
master 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
book 1
i 1
met 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
sheridan 1
s 1
mighty 1
speeches 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
behalf 1
of 1
catholic 1
emancipation 1
these 1
were 1
choice 1
documents 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
read 1
them 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
with 1
unabated 1
interest 1
they 1
gave 1
tongue 1
to 1
interesting 1
thoughts 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
soul 1
which 1
had 1
frequently 1
flashed 1
through 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
died 1
away 1
for 1
want 1
of 1
utterance 1
the 1
moral 1
which 1
i 1
gained 1
from 1
the 1
dialogue 1
was 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
truth 1
over 1
the 1
conscience 1
of 1
even 1
a 1
slaveholder 1
what 1
i 1
got 1
from 1
sheridan 1
was 1
a 1
bold 1
denunciation 1
of 1
slavery 1
and 1
a 1
powerful 1
vindication 1
of 1
human 1
rights 1
the 1
reading 1
of 1
these 1
documents 1
enabled 1
me 1
to 1
utter 1
my 1
thoughts 1
and 1
to 1
meet 1
the 1
arguments 1
brought 1
forward 1
to 1
sustain 1
slavery 1
but 1
while 1
they 1
relieved 1
me 1
of 1
one 1
difficulty 1
they 1
brought 1
on 1
another 1
even 1
more 1
painful 1
than 1
the 1
one 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
relieved 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
read 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
abhor 1
and 1
detest 1
my 1
enslavers 1
i 1
could 1
regard 1
them 1
in 1
no 1
other 1
light 1
than 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
successful 1
robbers 1
who 1
had 1
left 1
their 1
homes 1
and 1
gone 1
to 1
africa 1
and 1
stolen 1
us 1
from 1
our 1
homes 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
land 1
reduced 1
us 1
to 1
slavery 1
i 1
loathed 1
them 1
as 1
being 1
the 1
meanest 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
most 1
wicked 1
of 1
men 1
as 1
i 1
read 1
and 1
contemplated 1
the 1
subject 1
behold 1
that 1
very 1
discontentment 1
which 1
master 1
hugh 1
had 1
predicted 1
would 1
follow 1
my 1
learning 1
to 1
read 1
had 1
already 1
come 1
to 1
torment 1
and 1
sting 1
my 1
soul 1
to 1
unutterable 1
anguish 1
as 1
i 1
writhed 1
under 1
it 1
i 1
would 1
at 1
times 1
feel 1
that 1
learning 1
to 1
read 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
curse 1
rather 1
than 1
a 1
blessing 1
it 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
my 1
wretched 1
condition 1
without 1
the 1
remedy 1
it 1
opened 1
my 1
eyes 1
to 1
the 1
horrible 1
pit 1
but 1
to 1
no 1
ladder 1
upon 1
which 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
in 1
moments 1
of 1
agony 1
i 1
envied 1
my 1
fellow 1
slaves 1
for 1
their 1
stupidity 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
wished 1
myself 1
a 1
beast 1
i 1
preferred 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
the 1
meanest 1
reptile 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
any 1
thing 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
thinking 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
everlasting 1
thinking 1
of 1
my 1
condition 1
that 1
tormented 1
me 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
getting 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
by 1
every 1
object 1
within 1
sight 1
or 1
hearing 1
animate 1
or 1
inanimate 1
the 1
silver 1
trump 1
of 1
freedom 1
had 1
roused 1
my 1
soul 1
to 1
eternal 1
wakefulness 1
freedom 1
now 1
appeared 1
to 1
disappear 1
no 1
more 1
forever 1
it 1
was 1
heard 1
in 1
every 1
sound 1
and 1
seen 1
in 1
every 1
thing 1
it 1
was 1
ever 1
present 1
to 1
torment 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
my 1
wretched 1
condition 1
i 1
saw 1
nothing 1
without 1
seeing 1
it 1
i 1
heard 1
nothing 1
without 1
hearing 1
it 1
and 1
felt 1
nothing 1
without 1
feeling 1
it 1
it 1
looked 1
from 1
every 1
star 1
it 1
smiled 1
in 1
every 1
calm 1
breathed 1
in 1
every 1
wind 1
and 1
moved 1
in 1
every 1
storm 1
i 1
often 1
found 1
myself 1
regretting 1
my 1
own 1
existence 1
and 1
wishing 1
myself 1
dead 1
and 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
being 1
free 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
killed 1
myself 1
or 1
done 1
something 1
for 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
killed 1
while 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
i 1
was 1
eager 1
to 1
hear 1
any 1
one 1
speak 1
of 1
slavery 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
ready 1
listener 1
every 1
little 1
while 1
i 1
could 1
hear 1
something 1
about 1
the 1
abolitionists 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
i 1
found 1
what 1
the 1
word 1
meant 1
it 1
was 1
always 1
used 1
in 1
such 1
connections 1
as 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
an 1
interesting 1
word 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
a 1
slave 1
ran 1
away 1
and 1
succeeded 1
in 1
getting 1
clear 1
or 1
if 1
a 1
slave 1
killed 1
his 1
master 1
set 1
fire 1
to 1
a 1
barn 1
or 1
did 1
any 1
thing 1
very 1
wrong 1
in 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
a 1
slaveholder 1
it 1
was 1
spoken 1
of 1
as 1
the 1
fruit 1
of 1
_abolition 1
_ 1
hearing 1
the 1
word 1
in 1
this 1
connection 1
very 1
often 1
i 1
set 1
about 1
learning 1
what 1
it 1
meant 1
the 1
dictionary 1
afforded 1
me 1
little 1
or 1
no 1
help 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
abolishing 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
abolished 1
here 1
i 1
was 1
perplexed 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
ask 1
any 1
one 1
about 1
its 1
meaning 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
satisfied 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
something 1
they 1
wanted 1
me 1
to 1
know 1
very 1
little 1
about 1
after 1
a 1
patient 1
waiting 1
i 1
got 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
city 1
papers 1
containing 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
petitions 1
from 1
the 1
north 1
praying 1
for 1
the 1
abolition 1
of 1
slavery 1
in 1
the 1
district 1
of 1
columbia 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
slave 1
trade 1
between 1
the 1
states 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
understood 1
the 1
words 1
_abolition_ 1
and 1
_abolitionist 1
_ 1
and 1
always 1
drew 1
near 1
when 1
that 1
word 1
was 1
spoken 1
expecting 1
to 1
hear 1
something 1
of 1
importance 1
to 1
myself 1
and 1
fellow 1
slaves 1
the 1
light 1
broke 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
went 1
one 1
day 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
wharf 1
of 1
mr 1
waters 1
and 1
seeing 1
two 1
irishmen 1
unloading 1
a 1
scow 1
of 1
stone 1
i 1
went 1
unasked 1
and 1
helped 1
them 1
when 1
we 1
had 1
finished 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
came 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
a 1
slave 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
was 1
he 1
asked 1
are 1
ye 1
a 1
slave 1
for 1
life 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
good 1
irishman 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
deeply 1
affected 1
by 1
the 1
statement 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
pity 1
so 1
fine 1
a 1
little 1
fellow 1
as 1
myself 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
for 1
life 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
shame 1
to 1
hold 1
me 1
they 1
both 1
advised 1
me 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
north 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
find 1
friends 1
there 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
free 1
i 1
pretended 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
interested 1
in 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
and 1
treated 1
them 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
them 1
for 1
i 1
feared 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
treacherous 1
white 1
men 1
have 1
been 1
known 1
to 1
encourage 1
slaves 1
to 1
escape 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
reward 1
catch 1
them 1
and 1
return 1
them 1
to 1
their 1
masters 1
i 1
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
these 1
seemingly 1
good 1
men 1
might 1
use 1
me 1
so 1
but 1
i 1
nevertheless 1
remembered 1
their 1
advice 1
and 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
i 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
a 1
time 1
at 1
which 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
safe 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
escape 1
i 1
was 1
too 1
young 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
doing 1
so 1
immediately 1
besides 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
write 1
as 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
occasion 1
to 1
write 1
my 1
own 1
pass 1
i 1
consoled 1
myself 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
one 1
day 1
find 1
a 1
good 1
chance 1
meanwhile 1
i 1
would 1
learn 1
to 1
write 1
the 1
idea 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
i 1
might 1
learn 1
to 1
write 1
was 1
suggested 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
being 1
in 1
durgin 1
and 1
bailey 1
s 1
ship 1
yard 1
and 1
frequently 1
seeing 1
the 1
ship 1
carpenters 1
after 1
hewing 1
and 1
getting 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
timber 1
ready 1
for 1
use 1
write 1
on 1
the 1
timber 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
ship 1
for 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
intended 1
when 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
timber 1
was 1
intended 1
for 1
the 1
larboard 1
side 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
marked 1
thus 1
l 1
when 1
a 1
piece 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
starboard 1
side 1

would 1
be 1
marked 1
thus 1
s 1
a 1
piece 1

be 1

aft 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
marked 1
thus 1
s 1
a 1
i 1
soon 1
learned 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
these 1
letters 1
and 1
for 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
intended 1
when 1
placed 1
upon 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
timber 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
yard 1
i 1
immediately 1
commenced 1
copying 1
them 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
four 1
letters 1
named 1
after 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
met 1
with 1
any 1
boy 1
who 1
i 1
knew 1
could 1
write 1
i 1
would 1
tell 1
him 1
i 1
could 1
write 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
the 1
next 1
word 1
would 1
be 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
you 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
you 1
try 1
it 1
i 1
would 1
then 1
make 1
the 1
letters 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
fortunate 1
as 1
to 1
learn 1
and 1
ask 1
him 1
to 1
beat 1
that 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
lessons 1
in 1
writing 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
possible 1
i 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
gotten 1
in 1
any 1
other 1
way 1
during 1
this 1
time 1
my 1
copy 1
book 1
was 1
the 1
board 1
fence 1
brick 1
wall 1
and 1
pavement 1
my 1
pen 1
and 1
ink 1
was 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
chalk 1
with 1
these 1
i 1
learned 1
mainly 1
how 1
to 1
write 1
i 1
then 1
commenced 1
and 1
continued 1
copying 1
the 1
italics 1
in 1
webster 1
s 1
spelling 1
book 1
until 1
i 1
could 1
make 1
them 1
all 1
without 1
looking 1
on 1
the 1
book 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
my 1
little 1
master 1
thomas 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
school 1
and 1
learned 1
how 1
to 1
write 1
and 1
had 1
written 1
over 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
copy 1
books 1
these 1
had 1
been 1
brought 1
home 1
and 1
shown 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
our 1
near 1
neighbors 1
and 1
then 1
laid 1
aside 1
my 1
mistress 1
used 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
class 1
meeting 1
at 1
the 1
wilk 1
street 1
meetinghouse 1
every 1
monday 1
afternoon 1
and 1
leave 1
me 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
when 1
left 1
thus 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
writing 1
in 1
the 1
spaces 1
left 1
in 1
master 1
thomas 1
s 1
copy 1
book 1
copying 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
written 1
i 1
continued 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
until 1
i 1
could 1
write 1
a 1
hand 1
very 1
similar 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
master 1
thomas 1
thus 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
tedious 1
effort 1
for 1
years 1
i 1
finally 1
succeeded 1
in 1
learning 1
how 1
to 1
write 1
chapter 1
viii 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
after 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
baltimore 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
s 1
youngest 1
son 1
richard 1
died 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
three 1
years 1
and 1
six 1
months 1
after 1
his 1
death 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
captain 1
anthony 1
died 1
leaving 1
only 1
his 1
son 1
andrew 1
and 1
daughter 1
lucretia 1
to 1
share 1
his 1
estate 1
he 1
died 1
while 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
daughter 1
at 1
hillsborough 1
cut 1
off 1
thus 1
unexpectedly 1
he 1
left 1
no 1
will 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
disposal 1
of 1
his 1
property 1
it 1
was 1
therefore 1
necessary 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
valuation 1
of 1
the 1
property 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
equally 1
divided 1
between 1
mrs 1
lucretia 1
and 1
master 1
andrew 1
i 1
was 1
immediately 1
sent 1
for 1
to 1
be 1
valued 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
property 1
here 1
again 1
my 1
feelings 1
rose 1
up 1
in 1
detestation 1
of 1
slavery 1
i 1
had 1
now 1
a 1
new 1
conception 1
of 1
my 1
degraded 1
condition 1
prior 1
to 1
this 1
i 1
had 1
become 1
if 1
not 1
insensible 1
to 1
my 1
lot 1
at 1
least 1
partly 1
so 1
i 1
left 1
baltimore 1
with 1
a 1
young 1
heart 1
overborne 1
with 1
sadness 1
and 1
a 1
soul 1
full 1
of 1
apprehension 1
i 1
took 1
passage 1
with 1
captain 1
rowe 1
in 1
the 1
schooner 1
wild 1
cat 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
sail 1
of 1
about 1
twenty 1
four 1
hours 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
near 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
my 1
birth 1
i 1
had 1
now 1
been 1
absent 1
from 1
it 1
almost 1
if 1
not 1
quite 1
five 1
years 1
i 1
however 1
remembered 1
the 1
place 1
very 1
well 1
i 1
was 1
only 1
about 1
five 1
years 1
old 1
when 1
i 1
left 1
it 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
live 1
with 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
on 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
between 1
ten 1
and 1
eleven 1
years 1
old 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
ranked 1
together 1
at 1
the 1
valuation 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
old 1
and 1
young 1
married 1
and 1
single 1
were 1
ranked 1
with 1
horses 1
sheep 1
and 1
swine 1
there 1
were 1
horses 1
and 1
men 1
cattle 1
and 1
women 1
pigs 1
and 1
children 1
all 1
holding 1
the 1
same 1
rank 1
in 1
the 1
scale 1
of 1
being 1
and 1
were 1
all 1
subjected 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
narrow 1
examination 1
silvery 1
headed 1
age 1
and 1
sprightly 1
youth 1
maids 1
and 1
matrons 1
had 1
to 1
undergo 1
the 1
same 1
indelicate 1
inspection 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
i 1
saw 1
more 1
clearly 1
than 1
ever 1
the 1
brutalizing 1
effects 1
of 1
slavery 1
upon 1
both 1
slave 1
and 1
slaveholder 1
after 1
the 1
valuation 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
division 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
language 1
to 1
express 1
the 1
high 1
excitement 1
and 1
deep 1
anxiety 1
which 1
were 1
felt 1
among 1
us 1
poor 1
slaves 1
during 1
this 1
time 1
our 1
fate 1
for 1
life 1
was 1
now 1
to 1
be 1
decided 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
more 1
voice 1
in 1
that 1
decision 1
than 1
the 1
brutes 1
among 1
whom 1
we 1
were 1
ranked 1
a 1
single 1
word 1
from 1
the 1
white 1
men 1
was 1
enough 1
against 1
all 1
our 1
wishes 1
prayers 1
and 1
entreaties 1
to 1
sunder 1
forever 1
the 1
dearest 1
friends 1
dearest 1
kindred 1
and 1
strongest 1
ties 1
known 1
to 1
human 1
beings 1
in 1
addition 1
to 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
separation 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
horrid 1
dread 1
of 1
falling 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
master 1
andrew 1
he 1
was 1
known 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
most 1
cruel 1
wretch 1
a 1
common 1
drunkard 1
who 1
had 1
by 1
his 1
reckless 1
mismanagement 1
and 1
profligate 1
dissipation 1
already 1
wasted 1
a 1
large 1
portion 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
property 1
we 1
all 1
felt 1
that 1
we 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
sold 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
the 1
georgia 1
traders 1
as 1
to 1
pass 1
into 1
his 1
hands 1
for 1
we 1
knew 1
that 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
our 1
inevitable 1
condition 1
a 1
condition 1
held 1
by 1
us 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
utmost 1
horror 1
and 1
dread 1
i 1
suffered 1
more 1
anxiety 1
than 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
slaves 1
i 1
had 1
known 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
kindly 1
treated 1
they 1
had 1
known 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
little 1
or 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
very 1
deed 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
of 1
sorrow 1
and 1
acquainted 1
with 1
grief 1
their 1
backs 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
familiar 1
with 1
the 1
bloody 1
lash 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
become 1
callous 1
mine 1
was 1
yet 1
tender 1
for 1
while 1
at 1
baltimore 1
i 1
got 1
few 1
whippings 1
and 1
few 1
slaves 1
could 1
boast 1
of 1
a 1
kinder 1
master 1
and 1
mistress 1
than 1
myself 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
passing 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
hands 1
into 1
those 1
of 1
master 1
andrew 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
before 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
sample 1
of 1
his 1
bloody 1
disposition 1
took 1
my 1
little 1
brother 1
by 1
the 1
throat 1
threw 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
heel 1
of 1
his 1
boot 1
stamped 1
upon 1
his 1
head 1
till 1
the 1
blood 1
gushed 1
from 1
his 1
nose 1
and 1
ears 1
was 1
well 1
calculated 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
anxious 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
fate 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
committed 1
this 1
savage 1
outrage 1
upon 1
my 1
brother 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
serve 1
me 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
days 1
meaning 1
i 1
suppose 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
possession 1
thanks 1
to 1
a 1
kind 1
providence 1
i 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
portion 1
of 1
mrs 1
lucretia 1
and 1
was 1
sent 1
immediately 1
back 1
to 1
baltimore 1
to 1
live 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
master 1
hugh 1
their 1
joy 1
at 1
my 1
return 1
equalled 1
their 1
sorrow 1
at 1
my 1
departure 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
glad 1
day 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
escaped 1
a 1
worse 1
than 1
lion 1
s 1
jaws 1
i 1
was 1
absent 1
from 1
baltimore 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
valuation 1
and 1
division 1
just 1
about 1
one 1
month 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
six 1
very 1
soon 1
after 1
my 1
return 1
to 1
baltimore 1
my 1
mistress 1
lucretia 1
died 1
leaving 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
one 1
child 1
amanda 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
after 1
her 1
death 1
master 1
andrew 1
died 1
now 1
all 1
the 1
property 1
of 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
slaves 1
included 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
strangers 1
strangers 1
who 1
had 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
accumulating 1
it 1
not 1
a 1
slave 1
was 1
left 1
free 1
all 1
remained 1
slaves 1
from 1
the 1
youngest 1
to 1
the 1
oldest 1
if 1
any 1
one 1
thing 1
in 1
my 1
experience 1
more 1
than 1
another 1
served 1
to 1
deepen 1
my 1
conviction 1
of 1
the 1
infernal 1
character 1
of 1
slavery 1
and 1
to 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
unutterable 1
loathing 1
of 1
slaveholders 1
it 1
was 1
their 1
base 1
ingratitude 1
to 1
my 1
poor 1
old 1
grandmother 1
she 1
had 1
served 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
faithfully 1
from 1
youth 1
to 1
old 1
age 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
source 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
wealth 1
she 1
had 1
peopled 1
his 1
plantation 1
with 1
slaves 1
she 1
had 1
become 1
a 1
great 1
grandmother 1
in 1
his 1
service 1
she 1
had 1
rocked 1
him 1
in 1
infancy 1
attended 1
him 1
in 1
childhood 1
served 1
him 1
through 1
life 1
and 1
at 1
his 1
death 1
wiped 1
from 1
his 1
icy 1
brow 1
the 1
cold 1
death 1
sweat 1
and 1
closed 1
his 1
eyes 1
forever 1
she 1
was 1
nevertheless 1
left 1
a 1
slave 1
a 1
slave 1
for 1
life 1
a 1
slave 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
strangers 1
and 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
she 1
saw 1
her 1
children 1
her 1
grandchildren 1
and 1
her 1
great 1
grandchildren 1
divided 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
sheep 1
without 1
being 1
gratified 1
with 1
the 1
small 1
privilege 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
word 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
or 1
her 1
own 1
destiny 1
and 1
to 1
cap 1
the 1
climax 1
of 1
their 1
base 1
ingratitude 1
and 1
fiendish 1
barbarity 1
my 1
grandmother 1
who 1
was 1
now 1
very 1
old 1
having 1
outlived 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
children 1
having 1
seen 1
the 1
beginning 1
and 1
end 1
of 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
her 1
present 1
owners 1
finding 1
she 1
was 1
of 1
but 1
little 1
value 1
her 1
frame 1
already 1
racked 1
with 1
the 1
pains 1
of 1
old 1
age 1
and 1
complete 1
helplessness 1
fast 1
stealing 1
over 1
her 1
once 1
active 1
limbs 1
they 1
took 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
built 1
her 1
a 1
little 1
hut 1
put 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
mud 1
chimney 1
and 1
then 1
made 1
her 1
welcome 1
to 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
supporting 1
herself 1
there 1
in 1
perfect 1
loneliness 1
thus 1
virtually 1
turning 1
her 1
out 1
to 1
die 1
if 1
my 1
poor 1
old 1
grandmother 1
now 1
lives 1
she 1
lives 1
to 1
suffer 1
in 1
utter 1
loneliness 1
she 1
lives 1
to 1
remember 1
and 1
mourn 1
over 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
children 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
grandchildren 1
and 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
great 1
grandchildren 1
they 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
slave 1

sold 1
and 1
gone 1
to 1
the 1

lone 1
where 1
the 1
slave 1
whip 1
ceaseless 1
swings 1
where 1
the 1
noisome 1
insect 1
stings 1
where 1
the 1
fever 1

strews 1
poison 1
with 1
the 1

gone 1

gropes 1
her 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
age 1
for 1
a 1
drink 1
of 1
water 1

of 1
the 1
voices 1

hears 1
by 1
day 1
the 1
moans 1
of 1
the 1
dove 1
and 1
by 1
night 1

owl 1
all 1
is 1
gloom 1
the 1
grave 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
door 1

now 1
when 1
weighed 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
pains 1

aches 1
of 1
old 1
age 1
when 1
the 1
head 1
inclines 1
to 1
the 1
feet 1
when 1
the 1
beginning 1

ending 1
of 1
human 1
existence 1
meet 1
and 1
helpless 1
infancy 1
and 1
painful 1
old 1
age 1
combine 1
together 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
this 1
most 1
needful 1
time 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
exercise 1
of 1
that 1
tenderness 1
and 1
affection 1
which 1
children 1
only 1
can 1
exercise 1
towards 1
a 1
declining 1
parent 1
my 1
poor 1
old 1
grandmother 1
the 1
devoted 1
mother 1
of 1
twelve 1
children 1
is 1
left 1
all 1
alone 1
in 1
yonder 1
little 1
hut 1
before 1
a 1
few 1
dim 1
embers 1

stands 1
she 1
sits 1
she 1
staggers 1

there 1
are 1
none 1
of 1
her 1
children 1

grandchildren 1
present 1
to 1
wipe 1
from 1
her 1
wrinkled 1
brow 1
the 1
cold 1
sweat 1
of 1
death 1

to 1

remains 1

not 1

righteous 1

place 1
between 1

painful 1
separation 1

severe 1

this 1
interval 1
a 1
great 1
change 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
master 1
hugh 1
and 1
his 1
once 1
kind 1
and 1
affectionate 1
wife 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
brandy 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
of 1
slavery 1
upon 1
her 1
had 1
effected 1
a 1
disastrous 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
characters 1
of 1
both 1
so 1
that 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
concerned 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
had 1
little 1
to 1
lose 1
by 1
the 1
change 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
attached 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
those 1
little 1
baltimore 1
boys 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
strongest 1
attachment 1
i 1
had 1
received 1
many 1
good 1
lessons 1
from 1
them 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
receiving 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
leaving 1
them 1
was 1
painful 1
indeed 1
i 1
was 1
leaving 1
too 1
without 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
ever 1
being 1
allowed 1
to 1
return 1
master 1
thomas 1
had 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
let 1
me 1
return 1
again 1
the 1
barrier 1
betwixt 1
himself 1
and 1
brother 1
he 1
considered 1
impassable 1
i 1
then 1
had 1
to 1
regret 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
at 1
least 1
make 1
the 1
attempt 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
my 1
resolution 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
for 1
the 1
chances 1
of 1
success 1
are 1
tenfold 1
greater 1
from 1
the 1
city 1
than 1
from 1
the 1
country 1
i 1
sailed 1
from 1
baltimore 1
for 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
in 1
the 1
sloop 1
amanda 1
captain 1
edward 1
dodson 1
on 1
my 1
passage 1
i 1
paid 1
particular 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
direction 1
which 1
the 1
steamboats 1
took 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
philadelphia 1
i 1
found 1
instead 1
of 1
going 1
down 1
on 1
reaching 1
north 1
point 1
they 1
went 1
up 1
the 1
bay 1
in 1
a 1
north 1
easterly 1
direction 1
i 1
deemed 1
this 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
utmost 1
importance 1
my 1
determination 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
was 1
again 1
revived 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
wait 1
only 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
offering 1
of 1
a 1
favorable 1
opportunity 1
when 1
that 1
came 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
be 1
off 1
chapter 1
ix 1
i 1
have 1
now 1
reached 1
a 1
period 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
when 1
i 1
can 1
give 1
dates 1
i 1
left 1
baltimore 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
master 1
thomas 1
auld 1
at 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
in 1
march 1
1832 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
more 1
than 1
seven 1
years 1
since 1
i 1
lived 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
my 1
old 1
master 1
on 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
we 1
of 1
course 1
were 1
now 1
almost 1
entire 1
strangers 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
new 1
master 1
and 1
i 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
new 1
slave 1
i 1
was 1
ignorant 1
of 1
his 1
temper 1
and 1
disposition 1
he 1
was 1
equally 1
so 1
of 1
mine 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
however 1
brought 1
us 1
into 1
full 1
acquaintance 1
with 1
each 1
other 1
i 1
was 1
made 1
acquainted 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
not 1
less 1
than 1
with 1
himself 1
they 1
were 1
well 1
matched 1
being 1
equally 1
mean 1
and 1
cruel 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
during 1
a 1
space 1
of 1
more 1
than 1
seven 1
years 1
made 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
painful 1
gnawings 1
of 1
hunger 1
a 1
something 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
experienced 1
before 1
since 1
i 1
left 1
colonel 1
lloyd 1
s 1
plantation 1
it 1
went 1
hard 1
enough 1
with 1
me 1
then 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
look 1
back 1
to 1
no 1
period 1
at 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
enjoyed 1
a 1
sufficiency 1
it 1
was 1
tenfold 1
harder 1
after 1
living 1
in 1
master 1
hugh 1
s 1
family 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
had 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
of 1
that 1
which 1
was 1
good 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
master 1
thomas 1
was 1
a 1
mean 1
man 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
not 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
slave 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
is 1
regarded 1
as 1
the 1
most 1
aggravated 1
development 1
of 1
meanness 1
even 1
among 1
slaveholders 1
the 1
rule 1
is 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
coarse 1
the 1
food 1
only 1
let 1
there 1
be 1
enough 1
of 1
it 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
theory 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
maryland 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
came 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
general 1
practice 1
though 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
exceptions 1
master 1
thomas 1
gave 1
us 1
enough 1
of 1
neither 1
coarse 1
nor 1
fine 1
food 1
there 1
were 1
four 1
slaves 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
my 1
sister 1
eliza 1
my 1
aunt 1
priscilla 1
henny 1
and 1
myself 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
allowed 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
half 1
of 1
a 1
bushel 1
of 1
corn 1
meal 1
per 1
week 1
and 1
very 1
little 1
else 1
either 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
meat 1
or 1
vegetables 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
enough 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
subsist 1
upon 1
we 1
were 1
therefore 1
reduced 1
to 1
the 1
wretched 1
necessity 1
of 1
living 1
at 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
our 1
neighbors 1
this 1
we 1
did 1
by 1
begging 1
and 1
stealing 1
whichever 1
came 1
handy 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
need 1
the 1
one 1
being 1
considered 1
as 1
legitimate 1
as 1
the 1
other 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
times 1
have 1
we 1
poor 1
creatures 1
been 1
nearly 1
perishing 1
with 1
hunger 1
when 1
food 1
in 1
abundance 1
lay 1
mouldering 1
in 1
the 1
safe 1
and 1
smoke 1
house 1
and 1
our 1
pious 1
mistress 1
was 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
and 1
yet 1
that 1
mistress 1
and 1
her 1
husband 1
would 1
kneel 1
every 1
morning 1
and 1
pray 1
that 1
god 1
would 1
bless 1
them 1
in 1
basket 1
and 1
store 1
bad 1
as 1
all 1
slaveholders 1
are 1
we 1
seldom 1
meet 1
one 1
destitute 1
of 1
every 1
element 1
of 1
character 1
commanding 1
respect 1
my 1
master 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
this 1
rare 1
sort 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
of 1
one 1
single 1
noble 1
act 1
ever 1
performed 1
by 1
him 1
the 1
leading 1
trait 1
in 1
his 1
character 1
was 1
meanness 1
and 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
other 1
element 1
in 1
his 1
nature 1
it 1
was 1
made 1
subject 1
to 1
this 1
he 1
was 1
mean 1
and 1
like 1
most 1
other 1
mean 1
men 1
he 1
lacked 1
the 1
ability 1
to 1
conceal 1
his 1
meanness 1
captain 1
auld 1
was 1
not 1
born 1
a 1
slaveholder 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
master 1
only 1
of 1
a 1
bay 1
craft 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
possession 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
slaves 1
by 1
marriage 1
and 1
of 1
all 1
men 1
adopted 1
slaveholders 1
are 1
the 1
worst 1
he 1
was 1
cruel 1
but 1
cowardly 1
he 1
commanded 1
without 1
firmness 1
in 1
the 1
enforcement 1
of 1
his 1
rules 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
times 1
rigid 1
and 1
at 1
times 1
lax 1
at 1
times 1
he 1
spoke 1
to 1
his 1
slaves 1
with 1
the 1
firmness 1
of 1
napoleon 1
and 1
the 1
fury 1
of 1
a 1
demon 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
he 1
might 1
well 1
be 1
mistaken 1
for 1
an 1
inquirer 1
who 1
had 1
lost 1
his 1
way 1
he 1
did 1
nothing 1
of 1
himself 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
passed 1
for 1
a 1
lion 1
but 1
for 1
his 1
ears 1
in 1
all 1
things 1
noble 1
which 1
he 1
attempted 1
his 1
own 1
meanness 1
shone 1
most 1
conspicuous 1
his 1
airs 1
words 1
and 1
actions 1
were 1
the 1
airs 1
words 1
and 1
actions 1
of 1
born 1
slaveholders 1
and 1
being 1
assumed 1
were 1
awkward 1
enough 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
good 1
imitator 1
he 1
possessed 1
all 1
the 1
disposition 1
to 1
deceive 1
but 1
wanted 1
the 1
power 1
having 1
no 1
resources 1
within 1
himself 1
he 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
copyist 1
of 1
many 1
and 1
being 1
such 1
he 1
was 1
forever 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
inconsistency 1
and 1
of 1
consequence 1
he 1
was 1
an 1
object 1
of 1
contempt 1
and 1
was 1
held 1
as 1
such 1
even 1
by 1
his 1
slaves 1
the 1
luxury 1
of 1
having 1
slaves 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
to 1
wait 1
upon 1
him 1
was 1
something 1
new 1
and 1
unprepared 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
slaveholder 1
without 1
the 1
ability 1
to 1
hold 1
slaves 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
incapable 1
of 1
managing 1
his 1
slaves 1
either 1
by 1
force 1
fear 1
or 1
fraud 1
we 1
seldom 1
called 1
him 1
master 1
we 1
generally 1
called 1
him 1
captain 1
auld 1
and 1
were 1
hardly 1
disposed 1
to 1
title 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
doubt 1
not 1
that 1
our 1
conduct 1
had 1
much 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
making 1
him 1
appear 1
awkward 1
and 1
of 1
consequence 1
fretful 1
our 1
want 1
of 1
reverence 1
for 1
him 1
must 1
have 1
perplexed 1
him 1
greatly 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
have 1
us 1
call 1
him 1
master 1
but 1
lacked 1
the 1
firmness 1
necessary 1
to 1
command 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
his 1
wife 1
used 1
to 1
insist 1
upon 1
our 1
calling 1
him 1
so 1
but 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
in 1
august 1
1832 1
my 1
master 1
attended 1
a 1
methodist 1
camp 1
meeting 1
held 1
in 1
the 1
bay 1
side 1
talbot 1
county 1
and 1
there 1
experienced 1
religion 1
i 1
indulged 1
a 1
faint 1
hope 1
that 1
his 1
conversion 1
would 1
lead 1
him 1
to 1
emancipate 1
his 1
slaves 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
this 1
it 1
would 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
make 1
him 1
more 1
kind 1
and 1
humane 1
i 1
was 1
disappointed 1
in 1
both 1
these 1
respects 1
it 1
neither 1
made 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
humane 1
to 1
his 1
slaves 1
nor 1
to 1
emancipate 1
them 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
any 1
effect 1
on 1
his 1
character 1
it 1
made 1
him 1
more 1
cruel 1
and 1
hateful 1
in 1
all 1
his 1
ways 1
for 1
i 1
believe 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
much 1
worse 1
man 1
after 1
his 1
conversion 1
than 1
before 1
prior 1
to 1
his 1
conversion 1
he 1
relied 1
upon 1
his 1
own 1
depravity 1
to 1
shield 1
and 1
sustain 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
savage 1
barbarity 1
but 1
after 1
his 1
conversion 1
he 1
found 1
religious 1
sanction 1
and 1
support 1
for 1
his 1
slaveholding 1
cruelty 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
greatest 1
pretensions 1
to 1
piety 1
his 1
house 1
was 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
prayer 1
he 1
prayed 1
morning 1
noon 1
and 1
night 1
he 1
very 1
soon 1
distinguished 1
himself 1
among 1
his 1
brethren 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
made 1
a 1
class 1
leader 1
and 1
exhorter 1
his 1
activity 1
in 1
revivals 1
was 1
great 1
and 1
he 1
proved 1
himself 1
an 1
instrument 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
in 1
converting 1
many 1
souls 1
his 1
house 1
was 1
the 1
preachers 1
home 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
take 1
great 1
pleasure 1
in 1
coming 1
there 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
for 1
while 1
he 1
starved 1
us 1
he 1
stuffed 1
them 1
we 1

time 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
come 1
most 1
frequently 1
while 1

i 1
have 1
also 1
seen 1
mr 1
george 1
cookman 1
at 1
our 1
house 1
we 1
slaves 1
loved 1
mr 1
cookman 1
we 1
believed 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
man 1
we 1
thought 1
him 1
instrumental 1
in 1
getting 1
mr 1
samuel 1
harrison 1
a 1
very 1
rich 1
slaveholder 1
to 1
emancipate 1
his 1
slaves 1
and 1
by 1
some 1
means 1
got 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
laboring 1
to 1
effect 1
the 1
emancipation 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
slaves 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
our 1
house 1
we 1
were 1
sure 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
in 1
to 1
prayers 1
when 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
there 1
we 1
were 1
sometimes 1
called 1
in 1
and 1
sometimes 1
not 1
mr 1
cookman 1
took 1
more 1
notice 1
of 1
us 1
than 1
either 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
ministers 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
come 1
among 1
us 1
without 1
betraying 1
his 1
sympathy 1
for 1
us 1
and 1
stupid 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
sagacity 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
while 1
i 1
lived 1
with 1
my 1
master 1
in 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
white 1
young 1
man 1
a 1
mr 1
wilson 1
who 1
proposed 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
sabbath 1
school 1
for 1
the 1
instruction 1
of 1
such 1
slaves 1
as 1
might 1
be 1
disposed 1
to 1
learn 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
new 1
testament 1
we 1
met 1
but 1
three 1
times 1
when 1
mr 1
west 1
and 1
mr 1
fairbanks 1
both 1
class 1
leaders 1
with 1
many 1
others 1
came 1
upon 1
us 1
with 1
sticks 1
and 1
other 1
missiles 1
drove 1
us 1
off 1
and 1
forbade 1
us 1
to 1
meet 1
again 1
thus 1
ended 1
our 1
little 1
sabbath 1
school 1
in 1
the 1
pious 1
town 1
of 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
my 1
master 1
found 1
religious 1
sanction 1
for 1
his 1
cruelty 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
i 1
will 1
state 1
one 1
of 1
many 1
facts 1
going 1
to 1
prove 1
the 1
charge 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
him 1
tie 1
up 1
a 1
lame 1
young 1
woman 1
and 1
whip 1
her 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
cowskin 1
upon 1
her 1
naked 1
shoulders 1
causing 1
the 1
warm 1
red 1
blood 1
to 1
drip 1
and 1
in 1
justification 1
of 1
the 1
bloody 1
deed 1
he 1
would 1
quote 1
this 1
passage 1
of 1
scripture 1
he 1
that 1
knoweth 1
his 1
master 1
s 1
will 1
and 1
doeth 1
it 1
not 1
shall 1
be 1
beaten 1
with 1
many 1
stripes 1
master 1
would 1
keep 1
this 1
lacerated 1
young 1
woman 1
tied 1
up 1
in 1
this 1
horrid 1
situation 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
hours 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
him 1
to 1
tie 1
her 1
up 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
whip 1
her 1
before 1
breakfast 1
leave 1
her 1
go 1
to 1
his 1
store 1
return 1
at 1
dinner 1
and 1
whip 1
her 1
again 1
cutting 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
places 1
already 1
made 1
raw 1
with 1
his 1
cruel 1
lash 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
master 1
s 1
cruelty 1
toward 1
henny 1
is 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
fact 1
of 1
her 1
being 1
almost 1
helpless 1
when 1
quite 1
a 1
child 1
she 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
burned 1
herself 1
horribly 1
her 1
hands 1
were 1
so 1
burnt 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
got 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
them 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
very 1
little 1
but 1
bear 1
heavy 1
burdens 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
master 1
a 1
bill 1
of 1
expense 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
mean 1
man 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
constant 1
offence 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
seemed 1
desirous 1
of 1
getting 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
out 1
of 1
existence 1
he 1
gave 1
her 1
away 1
once 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
but 1
being 1
a 1
poor 1
gift 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
disposed 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
finally 1
my 1
benevolent 1
master 1
to 1
use 1
his 1
own 1
words 1
set 1
her 1
adrift 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
herself 1
here 1
was 1
a 1
recently 1
converted 1
man 1
holding 1
on 1
upon 1
the 1
mother 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
turning 1
out 1
her 1
helpless 1
child 1
to 1
starve 1
and 1
die 1
master 1
thomas 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
many 1
pious 1
slaveholders 1
who 1
hold 1
slaves 1
for 1
the 1
very 1
charitable 1
purpose 1
of 1
taking 1
care 1
of 1
them 1
my 1
master 1
and 1
myself 1
had 1
quite 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
differences 1
he 1
found 1
me 1
unsuitable 1
to 1
his 1
purpose 1
my 1
city 1
life 1
he 1
said 1
had 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
pernicious 1
effect 1
upon 1
me 1
it 1
had 1
almost 1
ruined 1
me 1
for 1
every 1
good 1
purpose 1
and 1
fitted 1
me 1
for 1
every 1
thing 1
which 1
was 1
bad 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
greatest 1
faults 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
letting 1
his 1
horse 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
inlaw 1
s 1
farm 1
which 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
miles 1
from 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
i 1
would 1
then 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
after 1
it 1
my 1
reason 1
for 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
carelessness 1
or 1
carefulness 1
was 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
always 1
get 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
there 1
master 1
william 1
hamilton 1
my 1
master 1
s 1
father 1
in 1
law 1
always 1
gave 1
his 1
slaves 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
i 1
never 1
left 1
there 1
hungry 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
great 1
the 1
need 1
of 1
my 1
speedy 1
return 1
master 1
thomas 1
at 1
length 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
stand 1
it 1
no 1
longer 1
i 1
had 1
lived 1
with 1
him 1
nine 1
months 1
during 1
which 1
time 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
severe 1
whippings 1
all 1
to 1
no 1
good 1
purpose 1
he 1
resolved 1
to 1
put 1
me 1
out 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
broken 1
and 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
he 1
let 1
me 1
for 1
one 1
year 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
named 1
edward 1
covey 1
mr 1
covey 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
a 1
farm 1
renter 1
he 1
rented 1
the 1
place 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
lived 1
as 1
also 1
the 1
hands 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
tilled 1
it 1
mr 1
covey 1
had 1
acquired 1
a 1
very 1
high 1
reputation 1
for 1
breaking 1
young 1
slaves 1
and 1
this 1
reputation 1
was 1
of 1
immense 1
value 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
enabled 1
him 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
farm 1
tilled 1
with 1
much 1
less 1
expense 1
to 1
himself 1
than 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
had 1
it 1
done 1
without 1
such 1
a 1
reputation 1
some 1
slaveholders 1
thought 1
it 1
not 1
much 1
loss 1
to 1
allow 1
mr 1
covey 1
to 1
have 1
their 1
slaves 1
one 1
year 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
the 1
training 1
to 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
subjected 1
without 1
any 1
other 1
compensation 1
he 1
could 1
hire 1
young 1
help 1
with 1
great 1
ease 1
in 1
consequence 1
of 1
this 1
reputation 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
natural 1
good 1
qualities 1
of 1
mr 1
covey 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
professor 1
of 1
religion 1
a 1
pious 1
soul 1
a 1
member 1
and 1
a 1
class 1
leader 1
in 1
the 1
methodist 1
church 1
all 1
of 1
this 1
added 1
weight 1
to 1
his 1
reputation 1
as 1
a 1
nigger 1
breaker 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
having 1
been 1
made 1
acquainted 1
with 1
them 1
by 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
lived 1
there 1
i 1
nevertheless 1
made 1
the 1
change 1
gladly 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
sure 1
of 1
getting 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
which 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
smallest 1
consideration 1
to 1
a 1
hungry 1
man 1
chapter 1
x 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
master 1
thomas 1
s 1
house 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
mr 1
covey 1
on 1
the 1
1st 1
of 1
january 1
1833 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
a 1
field 1
hand 1
in 1
my 1
new 1
employment 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
even 1
more 1
awkward 1
than 1
a 1
country 1
boy 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
large 1
city 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
my 1
new 1
home 1
but 1
one 1
week 1
before 1
mr 1
covey 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
very 1
severe 1
whipping 1
cutting 1
my 1
back 1
causing 1
the 1
blood 1
to 1
run 1
and 1
raising 1
ridges 1
on 1
my 1
flesh 1
as 1
large 1
as 1
my 1
little 1
finger 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
this 1
affair 1
are 1
as 1
follows 1
mr 1
covey 1
sent 1
me 1
very 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
coldest 1
days 1
in 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
january 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
wood 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
team 1
of 1
unbroken 1
oxen 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
in 1
hand 1
ox 1
and 1
which 1
the 1
off 1
hand 1
one 1
he 1
then 1
tied 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
rope 1
around 1
the 1
horns 1
of 1
the 1
in 1
hand 1
ox 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
if 1
the 1
oxen 1
started 1
to 1
run 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
hold 1
on 1
upon 1
the 1
rope 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
driven 1
oxen 1
before 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
awkward 1
i 1
however 1
succeeded 1
in 1
getting 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
with 1
little 1
difficulty 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
got 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
rods 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
the 1
oxen 1
took 1
fright 1
and 1
started 1
full 1
tilt 1
carrying 1
the 1
cart 1
against 1
trees 1
and 1
over 1
stumps 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
frightful 1
manner 1
i 1
expected 1
every 1
moment 1
that 1
my 1
brains 1
would 1
be 1
dashed 1
out 1
against 1
the 1
trees 1
after 1
running 1
thus 1
for 1
a 1
considerable 1
distance 1
they 1
finally 1
upset 1
the 1
cart 1
dashing 1
it 1
with 1
great 1
force 1
against 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
threw 1
themselves 1
into 1
a 1
dense 1
thicket 1
how 1
i 1
escaped 1
death 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
there 1
i 1
was 1
entirely 1
alone 1
in 1
a 1
thick 1
wood 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
new 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
cart 1
was 1
upset 1
and 1
shattered 1
my 1
oxen 1
were 1
entangled 1
among 1
the 1
young 1
trees 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
none 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
spell 1
of 1
effort 1
i 1
succeeded 1
in 1
getting 1
my 1
cart 1
righted 1
my 1
oxen 1
disentangled 1
and 1
again 1
yoked 1
to 1
the 1
cart 1
i 1
now 1
proceeded 1
with 1
my 1
team 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
been 1
chopping 1
wood 1
and 1
loaded 1
my 1
cart 1
pretty 1
heavily 1
thinking 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
to 1
tame 1
my 1
oxen 1
i 1
then 1
proceeded 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
home 1
i 1
had 1
now 1
consumed 1
one 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
safely 1
and 1
now 1
felt 1
out 1
of 1
danger 1
i 1
stopped 1
my 1
oxen 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
woods 1
gate 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
so 1
before 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
ox 1
rope 1
the 1
oxen 1
again 1
started 1
rushed 1
through 1
the 1
gate 1
catching 1
it 1
between 1
the 1
wheel 1
and 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
cart 1
tearing 1
it 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
coming 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
of 1
crushing 1
me 1
against 1
the 1
gate 1
post 1
thus 1
twice 1
in 1
one 1
short 1
day 1
i 1
escaped 1
death 1
by 1
the 1
merest 1
chance 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
i 1
told 1
mr 1
covey 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
how 1
it 1
happened 1
he 1
ordered 1
me 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
again 1
immediately 1
i 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
he 1
followed 1
on 1
after 1
me 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
he 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
stop 1
my 1
cart 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
teach 1
me 1
how 1
to 1
trifle 1
away 1
my 1
time 1
and 1
break 1
gates 1
he 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
large 1
gum 1
tree 1
and 1
with 1
his 1
axe 1
cut 1
three 1
large 1
switches 1
and 1
after 1
trimming 1
them 1
up 1
neatly 1
with 1
his 1
pocketknife 1
he 1
ordered 1
me 1
to 1
take 1
off 1
my 1
clothes 1
i 1
made 1
him 1
no 1
answer 1
but 1
stood 1
with 1
my 1
clothes 1
on 1
he 1
repeated 1
his 1
order 1
i 1
still 1
made 1
him 1
no 1
answer 1
nor 1
did 1
i 1
move 1
to 1
strip 1
myself 1
upon 1
this 1
he 1
rushed 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
fierceness 1
of 1
a 1
tiger 1
tore 1
off 1
my 1
clothes 1
and 1
lashed 1
me 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
worn 1
out 1
his 1
switches 1
cutting 1
me 1
so 1
savagely 1
as 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
marks 1
visible 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
after 1
this 1
whipping 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
a 1
number 1
just 1
like 1
it 1
and 1
for 1
similar 1
offences 1
i 1
lived 1
with 1
mr 1
covey 1
one 1
year 1
during 1
the 1
first 1
six 1
months 1
of 1
that 1
year 1
scarce 1
a 1
week 1
passed 1
without 1
his 1
whipping 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
seldom 1
free 1
from 1
a 1
sore 1
back 1
my 1
awkwardness 1
was 1
almost 1
always 1
his 1
excuse 1
for 1
whipping 1
me 1
we 1
were 1
worked 1
fully 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
endurance 1
long 1
before 1
day 1
we 1
were 1
up 1
our 1
horses 1
fed 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
first 1
approach 1
of 1
day 1
we 1
were 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
field 1
with 1
our 1
hoes 1
and 1
ploughing 1
teams 1
mr 1
covey 1
gave 1
us 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
but 1
scarce 1
time 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
we 1
were 1
often 1
less 1
than 1
five 1
minutes 1
taking 1
our 1
meals 1
we 1
were 1
often 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
approach 1
of 1
day 1
till 1
its 1
last 1
lingering 1
ray 1
had 1
left 1
us 1
and 1
at 1
saving 1
fodder 1
time 1
midnight 1
often 1
caught 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
binding 1
blades 1
covey 1
would 1
be 1
out 1
with 1
us 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
stand 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
he 1
would 1
spend 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
afternoons 1
in 1
bed 1
he 1
would 1
then 1
come 1
out 1
fresh 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
ready 1
to 1
urge 1
us 1
on 1
with 1
his 1
words 1
example 1
and 1
frequently 1
with 1
the 1
whip 1
mr 1
covey 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
few 1
slaveholders 1
who 1
could 1
and 1
did 1
work 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
hard 1
working 1
man 1
he 1
knew 1
by 1
himself 1
just 1
what 1
a 1
man 1
or 1
a 1
boy 1
could 1
do 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
deceiving 1
him 1
his 1
work 1
went 1
on 1
in 1
his 1
absence 1
almost 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
in 1
his 1
presence 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
faculty 1
of 1
making 1
us 1
feel 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
ever 1
present 1
with 1
us 1
this 1
he 1
did 1
by 1
surprising 1
us 1
he 1
seldom 1
approached 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
we 1
were 1
at 1
work 1
openly 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
secretly 1
he 1
always 1
aimed 1
at 1
taking 1
us 1
by 1
surprise 1
such 1
was 1
his 1
cunning 1
that 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
call 1
him 1
among 1
ourselves 1
the 1
snake 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
at 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
cornfield 1
he 1
would 1
sometimes 1
crawl 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
to 1
avoid 1
detection 1
and 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
he 1
would 1
rise 1
nearly 1
in 1
our 1
midst 1
and 1
scream 1
out 1
ha 1
ha 1
come 1
come 1
dash 1
on 1
dash 1
on 1
this 1
being 1
his 1
mode 1
of 1
attack 1
it 1
was 1
never 1
safe 1
to 1
stop 1
a 1
single 1
minute 1
his 1
comings 1
were 1
like 1
a 1
thief 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
being 1
ever 1
at 1
hand 1
he 1
was 1
under 1
every 1
tree 1
behind 1
every 1
stump 1
in 1
every 1
bush 1
and 1
at 1
every 1
window 1
on 1
the 1
plantation 1
he 1
would 1
sometimes 1
mount 1
his 1
horse 1
as 1
if 1
bound 1
to 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
a 1
distance 1
of 1
seven 1
miles 1
and 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
afterwards 1
you 1
would 1
see 1
him 1
coiled 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
fence 1
watching 1
every 1
motion 1
of 1
the 1
slaves 1
he 1
would 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
leave 1
his 1
horse 1
tied 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
again 1
he 1
would 1
sometimes 1
walk 1
up 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
give 1
us 1
orders 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
starting 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
journey 1
turn 1
his 1
back 1
upon 1
us 1
and 1
make 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
get 1
ready 1
and 1
before 1
he 1
would 1
get 1
half 1
way 1
thither 1
he 1
would 1
turn 1
short 1
and 1
crawl 1
into 1
a 1
fence 1
corner 1
or 1
behind 1
some 1
tree 1
and 1
there 1
watch 1
us 1
till 1
the 1
going 1
down 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
mr 1
covey 1
s 1
forte 1
consisted 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
to 1
deceive 1
his 1
life 1
was 1
devoted 1
to 1
planning 1
and 1
perpetrating 1
the 1
grossest 1
deceptions 1
every 1
thing 1
he 1
possessed 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
learning 1
or 1
religion 1
he 1
made 1
conform 1
to 1
his 1
disposition 1
to 1
deceive 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
himself 1
equal 1
to 1
deceiving 1
the 1
almighty 1
he 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
short 1
prayer 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
prayer 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
strange 1
as 1
it 1
may 1
seem 1
few 1
men 1
would 1
at 1
times 1
appear 1
more 1
devotional 1
than 1
he 1
the 1
exercises 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
devotions 1
were 1
always 1
commenced 1
with 1
singing 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
poor 1
singer 1
himself 1
the 1
duty 1
of 1
raising 1
the 1
hymn 1
generally 1
came 1
upon 1
me 1
he 1
would 1
read 1
his 1
hymn 1
and 1
nod 1
at 1
me 1
to 1
commence 1
i 1
would 1
at 1
times 1
do 1
so 1
at 1
others 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
my 1
non 1
compliance 1
would 1
almost 1
always 1
produce 1
much 1
confusion 1
to 1
show 1
himself 1
independent 1
of 1
me 1
he 1
would 1
start 1
and 1
stagger 1
through 1
with 1
his 1
hymn 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
discordant 1
manner 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
he 1
prayed 1
with 1
more 1
than 1
ordinary 1
spirit 1
poor 1
man 1
such 1
was 1
his 1
disposition 1
and 1
success 1
at 1
deceiving 1
i 1
do 1
verily 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
sometimes 1
deceived 1
himself 1
into 1
the 1
solemn 1
belief 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
sincere 1
worshipper 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
high 1
god 1
and 1
this 1
too 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
guilty 1
of 1
compelling 1
his 1
woman 1
slave 1
to 1
commit 1
the 1
sin 1
of 1
adultery 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
are 1
these 1
mr 1
covey 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
commencing 1
in 1
life 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
able 1
to 1
buy 1
one 1
slave 1
and 1
shocking 1
as 1
is 1
the 1
fact 1
he 1
bought 1
her 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
for 1
a 1
breeder 1
this 1
woman 1
was 1
named 1
caroline 1
mr 1
covey 1
bought 1
her 1
from 1
mr 1
thomas 1
lowe 1
about 1
six 1
miles 1
from 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
able 1
bodied 1
woman 1
about 1
twenty 1
years 1
old 1
she 1
had 1
already 1
given 1
birth 1
to 1
one 1
child 1
which 1
proved 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
just 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
after 1
buying 1
her 1
he 1
hired 1
a 1
married 1
man 1
of 1
mr 1
samuel 1
harrison 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
him 1
one 1
year 1
and 1
him 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
fasten 1
up 1
with 1
her 1
every 1
night 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
the 1
miserable 1
woman 1
gave 1
birth 1
to 1
twins 1
at 1
this 1
result 1
mr 1
covey 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
highly 1
pleased 1
both 1
with 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
wretched 1
woman 1
such 1
was 1
his 1
joy 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
his 1
wife 1
that 1
nothing 1
they 1
could 1
do 1
for 1
caroline 1
during 1
her 1
confinement 1
was 1
too 1
good 1
or 1
too 1
hard 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
regarded 1
as 1
being 1
quite 1
an 1
addition 1
to 1
his 1
wealth 1
if 1
at 1
any 1
one 1
time 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
more 1
than 1
another 1
i 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
drink 1
the 1
bitterest 1
dregs 1
of 1
slavery 1
that 1
time 1
was 1
during 1
the 1
first 1
six 1
months 1
of 1
my 1
stay 1
with 1
mr 1
covey 1
we 1
were 1
worked 1
in 1
all 1
weathers 1
it 1
was 1
never 1
too 1
hot 1
or 1
too 1
cold 1
it 1
could 1
never 1
rain 1
blow 1
hail 1
or 1
snow 1
too 1
hard 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
work 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
work 1
work 1
work 1
was 1
scarcely 1
more 1
the 1
order 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
than 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
longest 1
days 1
were 1
too 1
short 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
shortest 1
nights 1
too 1
long 1
for 1
him 1
i 1
was 1
somewhat 1
unmanageable 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
went 1
there 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
of 1
this 1
discipline 1
tamed 1
me 1
mr 1
covey 1
succeeded 1
in 1
breaking 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
broken 1
in 1
body 1
soul 1
and 1
spirit 1
my 1
natural 1
elasticity 1
was 1
crushed 1
my 1
intellect 1
languished 1
the 1
disposition 1
to 1
read 1
departed 1
the 1
cheerful 1
spark 1
that 1
lingered 1
about 1
my 1
eye 1
died 1
the 1
dark 1
night 1
of 1
slavery 1
closed 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
behold 1
a 1
man 1
transformed 1
into 1
a 1
brute 1
sunday 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
leisure 1
time 1
i 1
spent 1
this 1
in 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
beast 1
like 1
stupor 1
between 1
sleep 1
and 1
wake 1
under 1
some 1
large 1
tree 1
at 1
times 1
i 1
would 1
rise 1
up 1
a 1
flash 1
of 1
energetic 1
freedom 1
would 1
dart 1
through 1
my 1
soul 1
accompanied 1
with 1
a 1
faint 1
beam 1
of 1
hope 1
that 1
flickered 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
vanished 1
i 1
sank 1
down 1
again 1
mourning 1
over 1
my 1
wretched 1
condition 1
i 1
was 1
sometimes 1
prompted 1
to 1
take 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
covey 1
but 1
was 1
prevented 1
by 1
a 1
combination 1
of 1
hope 1
and 1
fear 1
my 1
sufferings 1
on 1
this 1
plantation 1
seem 1
now 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
rather 1
than 1
a 1
stern 1
reality 1
our 1
house 1
stood 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
rods 1
of 1
the 1
chesapeake 1
bay 1
whose 1
broad 1
bosom 1
was 1
ever 1
white 1
with 1
sails 1
from 1
every 1
quarter 1
of 1
the 1
habitable 1
globe 1
those 1
beautiful 1
vessels 1
robed 1
in 1
purest 1
white 1
so 1
delightful 1
to 1
the 1
eye 1
of 1
freemen 1
were 1
to 1
me 1
so 1
many 1
shrouded 1
ghosts 1
to 1
terrify 1
and 1
torment 1
me 1
with 1
thoughts 1
of 1
my 1
wretched 1
condition 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
stillness 1
of 1
a 1
summer 1
s 1
sabbath 1
stood 1
all 1
alone 1
upon 1
the 1
lofty 1
banks 1
of 1
that 1
noble 1
bay 1
and 1
traced 1
with 1
saddened 1
heart 1
and 1
tearful 1
eye 1
the 1
countless 1
number 1
of 1
sails 1
moving 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
mighty 1
ocean 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
these 1
always 1
affected 1
me 1
powerfully 1
my 1
thoughts 1
would 1
compel 1
utterance 1
and 1
there 1
with 1
no 1
audience 1
but 1
the 1
almighty 1
i 1
would 1
pour 1
out 1
my 1
soul 1
s 1
complaint 1
in 1
my 1
rude 1
way 1
with 1
an 1
apostrophe 1

moving 1
multitude 1
of 1

used 1

almost 1
to 1
madness 1
at 1
one 1
moment 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
next 1
reconciling 1
myself 1
to 1
my 1
wretched 1
lot 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
intimated 1
that 1
my 1
condition 1
was 1
much 1
worse 1
during 1
the 1
first 1
six 1
months 1
of 1
my 1
stay 1
at 1
mr 1
covey 1

in 1
the 1
last 1

circumstances 1

to 1
the 1
change 1

course 1
toward 1
me 1
form 1
an 1
epoch 1
in 1
my 1
humble 1
history 1
you 1
have 1
seen 1
how 1
a 1
man 1
was 1
made 1
a 1
slave 1
you 1
shall 1
see 1
how 1
a 1
slave 1
was 1
made 1
a 1
man 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hottest 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
august 1
1833 1
bill 1
smith 1
william 1
hughes 1
a 1
slave 1
named 1
eli 1
and 1
myself 1
were 1
engaged 1
in 1
fanning 1
wheat 1
hughes 1
was 1
clearing 1
the 1
fanned 1
wheat 1
from 1
before 1
the 1
fan 1
eli 1
was 1
turning 1
smith 1
was 1
feeding 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
carrying 1
wheat 1
to 1
the 1
fan 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
simple 1
requiring 1
strength 1
rather 1
than 1
intellect 1
yet 1
to 1
one 1
entirely 1
unused 1
to 1
such 1
work 1
it 1
came 1
very 1
hard 1
about 1
three 1
o 1
clock 1
of 1
that 1
day 1
i 1
broke 1
down 1
my 1
strength 1
failed 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
seized 1
with 1
a 1
violent 1
aching 1
of 1
the 1
head 1
attended 1
with 1
extreme 1
dizziness 1
i 1
trembled 1
in 1
every 1
limb 1
finding 1
what 1
was 1
coming 1
i 1
nerved 1
myself 1
up 1
feeling 1
it 1
would 1
never 1
do 1
to 1
stop 1
work 1
i 1
stood 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
stagger 1
to 1
the 1
hopper 1
with 1
grain 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
stand 1
no 1
longer 1
i 1
fell 1
and 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
held 1
down 1
by 1
an 1
immense 1
weight 1
the 1
fan 1
of 1
course 1
stopped 1
every 1
one 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
do 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
have 1
his 1
own 1
go 1
on 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
mr 1
covey 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
about 1
one 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
treading 1
yard 1
where 1
we 1
were 1
fanning 1
on 1
hearing 1
the 1
fan 1
stop 1
he 1
left 1
immediately 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
we 1
were 1
he 1
hastily 1
inquired 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
bill 1
answered 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
sick 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
bring 1
wheat 1
to 1
the 1
fan 1
i 1
had 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
crawled 1
away 1
under 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
post 1
and 1
rail 1
fence 1
by 1
which 1
the 1
yard 1
was 1
enclosed 1
hoping 1
to 1
find 1
relief 1
by 1
getting 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
he 1
then 1
asked 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hands 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
after 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
awhile 1
asked 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
for 1
i 1
scarce 1
had 1
strength 1
to 1
speak 1
he 1
then 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
savage 1
kick 1
in 1
the 1
side 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
but 1
fell 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
attempt 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
another 1
kick 1
and 1
again 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
rise 1
i 1
again 1
tried 1
and 1
succeeded 1
in 1
gaining 1
my 1
feet 1
but 1
stooping 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
tub 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
feeding 1
the 1
fan 1
i 1
again 1
staggered 1
and 1
fell 1
while 1
down 1
in 1
this 1
situation 1
mr 1
covey 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
hickory 1
slat 1
with 1
which 1
hughes 1
had 1
been 1
striking 1
off 1
the 1
half 1
bushel 1
measure 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
heavy 1
blow 1
upon 1
the 1
head 1
making 1
a 1
large 1
wound 1
and 1
the 1
blood 1
ran 1
freely 1
and 1
with 1
this 1
again 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
i 1
made 1
no 1
effort 1
to 1
comply 1
having 1
now 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
do 1
his 1
worst 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
after 1
receiving 1
this 1
blow 1
my 1
head 1
grew 1
better 1
mr 1
covey 1
had 1
now 1
left 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
fate 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
i 1
resolved 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
my 1
master 1
enter 1
a 1
complaint 1
and 1
ask 1
his 1
protection 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
i 1
must 1
that 1
afternoon 1
walk 1
seven 1
miles 1
and 1
this 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
was 1
truly 1
a 1
severe 1
undertaking 1
i 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
feeble 1
made 1
so 1
as 1
much 1
by 1
the 1
kicks 1
and 1
blows 1
which 1
i 1
received 1
as 1
by 1
the 1
severe 1
fit 1
of 1
sickness 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
subjected 1
i 1
however 1
watched 1
my 1
chance 1
while 1
covey 1
was 1
looking 1
in 1
an 1
opposite 1
direction 1
and 1
started 1
for 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
i 1
succeeded 1
in 1
getting 1
a 1
considerable 1
distance 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
covey 1
discovered 1
me 1
and 1
called 1
after 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
threatening 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
i 1
disregarded 1
both 1
his 1
calls 1
and 1
his 1
threats 1
and 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
my 1
feeble 1
state 1
would 1
allow 1
and 1
thinking 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
overhauled 1
by 1
him 1
if 1
i 1
kept 1
the 1
road 1
i 1
walked 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
keeping 1
far 1
enough 1
from 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
avoid 1
detection 1
and 1
near 1
enough 1
to 1
prevent 1
losing 1
my 1
way 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
before 1
my 1
little 1
strength 1
again 1
failed 1
me 1
i 1
could 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
i 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
lay 1
for 1
a 1
considerable 1
time 1
the 1
blood 1
was 1
yet 1
oozing 1
from 1
the 1
wound 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
should 1
bleed 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
think 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
blood 1
so 1
matted 1
my 1
hair 1
as 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
wound 1
after 1
lying 1
there 1
about 1
three 1
quarters 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
i 1
nerved 1
myself 1
up 1
again 1
and 1
started 1
on 1
my 1
way 1
through 1
bogs 1
and 1
briers 1
barefooted 1
and 1
bareheaded 1
tearing 1
my 1
feet 1
sometimes 1
at 1
nearly 1
every 1
step 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
journey 1
of 1
about 1
seven 1
miles 1
occupying 1
some 1
five 1
hours 1
to 1
perform 1
it 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
master 1
s 1
store 1
i 1
then 1
presented 1
an 1
appearance 1
enough 1
to 1
affect 1
any 1
but 1
a 1
heart 1
of 1
iron 1
from 1
the 1
crown 1
of 1
my 1
head 1
to 1
my 1
feet 1
i 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
blood 1
my 1
hair 1
was 1
all 1
clotted 1
with 1
dust 1
and 1
blood 1
my 1
shirt 1
was 1
stiff 1
with 1
blood 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
escaped 1
a 1
den 1
of 1
wild 1
beasts 1
and 1
barely 1
escaped 1
them 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
i 1
appeared 1
before 1
my 1
master 1
humbly 1
entreating 1
him 1
to 1
interpose 1
his 1
authority 1
for 1
my 1
protection 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
circumstances 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
at 1
times 1
to 1
affect 1
him 1
he 1
would 1
then 1
walk 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
seek 1
to 1
justify 1
covey 1
by 1
saying 1
he 1
expected 1
i 1
deserved 1
it 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
wanted 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
get 1
a 1
new 1
home 1
that 1
as 1
sure 1
as 1
i 1
lived 1
with 1
mr 1
covey 1
again 1
i 1
should 1
live 1
with 1
but 1
to 1
die 1
with 1
him 1
that 1
covey 1
would 1
surely 1
kill 1
me 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
fair 1
way 1
for 1
it 1
master 1
thomas 1
ridiculed 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
danger 1
of 1
mr 1
covey 1
s 1
killing 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
mr 1
covey 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
man 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
taking 1
me 1
from 1
him 1
that 1
should 1
he 1
do 1
so 1
he 1
would 1
lose 1
the 1
whole 1
year 1
s 1
wages 1
that 1
i 1
belonged 1
to 1
mr 1
covey 1
for 1
one 1
year 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
him 1
come 1
what 1
might 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
trouble 1
him 1
with 1
any 1
more 1
stories 1
or 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
himself 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
me 1
after 1
threatening 1
me 1
thus 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
dose 1
of 1
salts 1
telling 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
remain 1
in 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
that 1
night 1
it 1
being 1
quite 1
late 1
but 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
off 1
back 1
to 1
mr 1
covey 1
s 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
he 1
would 1
_get 1
hold 1
of 1
me 1
_ 1
which 1
meant 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
whip 1
me 1
i 1
remained 1
all 1
night 1
and 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
orders 1
i 1
started 1
off 1
to 1
covey 1
s 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
saturday 1
morning 1
wearied 1
in 1
body 1
and 1
broken 1
in 1
spirit 1
i 1
got 1
no 1
supper 1
that 1
night 1
or 1
breakfast 1
that 1
morning 1
i 1
reached 1
covey 1
s 1
about 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
getting 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
that 1
divided 1
mrs 1
kemp 1
s 1
fields 1
from 1
ours 1
out 1
ran 1
covey 1
with 1
his 1
cowskin 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
another 1
whipping 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
reach 1
me 1
i 1
succeeded 1
in 1
getting 1
to 1
the 1
cornfield 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
corn 1
was 1
very 1
high 1
it 1
afforded 1
me 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
hiding 1
he 1
seemed 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
searched 1
for 1
me 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
my 1
behavior 1
was 1
altogether 1
unaccountable 1
he 1
finally 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
chase 1
thinking 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
come 1
home 1
for 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
he 1
would 1
give 1
himself 1
no 1
further 1
trouble 1
in 1
looking 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
spent 1
that 1
day 1
mostly 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
having 1
the 1
alternative 1
before 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
and 1
be 1
whipped 1
to 1
death 1
or 1
stay 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
be 1
starved 1
to 1
death 1
that 1
night 1
i 1
fell 1
in 1
with 1
sandy 1
jenkins 1
a 1
slave 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
was 1
somewhat 1
acquainted 1
sandy 1
had 1
a 1
free 1
wife 1
who 1
lived 1
about 1
four 1
miles 1
from 1
mr 1
covey 1
s 1
and 1
it 1
being 1
saturday 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
my 1
circumstances 1
and 1
he 1
very 1
kindly 1
invited 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
talked 1
this 1
whole 1
matter 1
over 1
and 1
got 1
his 1
advice 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
best 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
pursue 1
i 1
found 1
sandy 1
an 1
old 1
adviser 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
with 1
great 1
solemnity 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
covey 1
but 1
that 1
before 1
i 1
went 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
with 1
him 1
into 1
another 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
_root 1
_ 1
which 1
if 1
i 1
would 1
take 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
me 1
carrying 1
it 1
_always 1
on 1
my 1
right 1
side 1
_ 1
would 1
render 1
it 1
impossible 1
for 1
mr 1
covey 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
white 1
man 1
to 1
whip 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
carried 1
it 1
for 1
years 1
and 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
received 1
a 1
blow 1
and 1
never 1
expected 1
to 1
while 1
he 1
carried 1
it 1
i 1
at 1
first 1
rejected 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
the 1
simple 1
carrying 1
of 1
a 1
root 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
would 1
have 1
any 1
such 1
effect 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
and 1
was 1
not 1
disposed 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
but 1
sandy 1
impressed 1
the 1
necessity 1
with 1
much 1
earnestness 1
telling 1
me 1
it 1
could 1
do 1
no 1
harm 1
if 1
it 1
did 1
no 1
good 1
to 1
please 1
him 1
i 1
at 1
length 1
took 1
the 1
root 1
and 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
direction 1
carried 1
it 1
upon 1
my 1
right 1
side 1
this 1
was 1
sunday 1
morning 1
i 1
immediately 1
started 1
for 1
home 1
and 1
upon 1
entering 1
the 1
yard 1
gate 1
out 1
came 1
mr 1
covey 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
meeting 1
he 1
spoke 1
to 1
me 1
very 1
kindly 1
bade 1
me 1
drive 1
the 1
pigs 1
from 1
a 1
lot 1
near 1
by 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
towards 1
the 1
church 1
now 1
this 1
singular 1
conduct 1
of 1
mr 1
covey 1
really 1
made 1
me 1
begin 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
root 1
which 1
sandy 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
and 1
had 1
it 1
been 1
on 1
any 1
other 1
day 1
than 1
sunday 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
attributed 1
the 1
conduct 1
to 1
no 1
other 1
cause 1
than 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
that 1
root 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
was 1
half 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
the 1
_root_ 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
at 1
first 1
had 1
taken 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
all 1
went 1
well 1
till 1
monday 1
morning 1
on 1
this 1
morning 1
the 1
virtue 1
of 1
the 1
root 1
was 1
fully 1
tested 1
long 1
before 1
daylight 1
i 1
was 1
called 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
rub 1
curry 1
and 1
feed 1
the 1
horses 1
i 1
obeyed 1
and 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
obey 1
but 1
whilst 1
thus 1
engaged 1
whilst 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
throwing 1
down 1
some 1
blades 1
from 1
the 1
loft 1
mr 1
covey 1
entered 1
the 1
stable 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
rope 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
half 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
loft 1
he 1
caught 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
legs 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
tying 1
me 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
found 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
up 1
to 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
sudden 1
spring 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
so 1
he 1
holding 1
to 1
my 1
legs 1
i 1
was 1
brought 1
sprawling 1
on 1
the 1
stable 1
floor 1
mr 1
covey 1
seemed 1
now 1
to 1
think 1
he 1
had 1
me 1
and 1
could 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
pleased 1
but 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
from 1
whence 1
came 1
the 1
spirit 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
fight 1
and 1
suiting 1
my 1
action 1
to 1
the 1
resolution 1
i 1
seized 1
covey 1
hard 1
by 1
the 1
throat 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
so 1
i 1
rose 1
he 1
held 1
on 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
to 1
him 1
my 1
resistance 1
was 1
so 1
entirely 1
unexpected 1
that 1
covey 1
seemed 1
taken 1
all 1
aback 1
he 1
trembled 1
like 1
a 1
leaf 1
this 1
gave 1
me 1
assurance 1
and 1
i 1
held 1
him 1
uneasy 1
causing 1
the 1
blood 1
to 1
run 1
where 1
i 1
touched 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
ends 1
of 1
my 1
fingers 1
mr 1
covey 1
soon 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
hughes 1
for 1
help 1
hughes 1
came 1
and 1
while 1
covey 1
held 1
me 1
attempted 1
to 1
tie 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
doing 1
so 1
i 1
watched 1
my 1
chance 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
heavy 1
kick 1
close 1
under 1
the 1
ribs 1
this 1
kick 1
fairly 1
sickened 1
hughes 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
left 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
mr 1
covey 1
this 1
kick 1
had 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
not 1
only 1
weakening 1
hughes 1
but 1
covey 1
also 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
hughes 1
bending 1
over 1
with 1
pain 1
his 1
courage 1
quailed 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
meant 1
to 1
persist 1
in 1
my 1
resistance 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
did 1
come 1
what 1
might 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
brute 1
for 1
six 1
months 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
be 1
used 1
so 1
no 1
longer 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
strove 1
to 1
drag 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
stick 1
that 1
was 1
lying 1
just 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
stable 1
door 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
knock 1
me 1
down 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
leaning 1
over 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
stick 1
i 1
seized 1
him 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
by 1
his 1
collar 1
and 1
brought 1
him 1
by 1
a 1
sudden 1
snatch 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
bill 1
came 1
covey 1
called 1
upon 1
him 1
for 1
assistance 1
bill 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
covey 1
said 1
take 1
hold 1
of 1
him 1
take 1
hold 1
of 1
him 1
bill 1
said 1
his 1
master 1
hired 1
him 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
help 1
to 1
whip 1
me 1
so 1
he 1
left 1
covey 1
and 1
myself 1
to 1
fight 1
our 1
own 1
battle 1
out 1
we 1
were 1
at 1
it 1
for 1
nearly 1
two 1
hours 1
covey 1
at 1
length 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
puffing 1
and 1
blowing 1
at 1
a 1
great 1
rate 1
saying 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
resisted 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
whipped 1
me 1
half 1
so 1
much 1
the 1
truth 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
whipped 1
me 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
considered 1
him 1
as 1
getting 1
entirely 1
the 1
worst 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
bargain 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
drawn 1
no 1
blood 1
from 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
from 1
him 1
the 1
whole 1
six 1
months 1
afterwards 1
that 1
i 1
spent 1
with 1
mr 1
covey 1
he 1
never 1
laid 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
his 1
finger 1
upon 1
me 1
in 1
anger 1
he 1
would 1
occasionally 1
say 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
me 1
again 1
no 1
thought 1
i 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
for 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
off 1
worse 1
than 1
you 1
did 1
before 1
this 1
battle 1
with 1
mr 1
covey 1
was 1
the 1
turning 1
point 1
in 1
my 1
career 1
as 1
a 1
slave 1
it 1
rekindled 1
the 1
few 1
expiring 1
embers 1
of 1
freedom 1
and 1
revived 1
within 1
me 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
manhood 1
it 1
recalled 1
the 1
departed 1
self 1
confidence 1
and 1
inspired 1
me 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
determination 1
to 1
be 1
free 1
the 1
gratification 1
afforded 1
by 1
the 1
triumph 1
was 1
a 1
full 1
compensation 1
for 1
whatever 1
else 1
might 1
follow 1
even 1
death 1
itself 1
he 1
only 1
can 1
understand 1
the 1
deep 1
satisfaction 1
which 1
i 1
experienced 1
who 1
has 1
himself 1
repelled 1
by 1
force 1
the 1
bloody 1
arm 1
of 1
slavery 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
i 1
never 1
felt 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
glorious 1
resurrection 1
from 1
the 1
tomb 1
of 1
slavery 1
to 1
the 1
heaven 1
of 1
freedom 1
my 1
long 1
crushed 1
spirit 1
rose 1
cowardice 1
departed 1
bold 1
defiance 1
took 1
its 1
place 1
and 1
i 1
now 1
resolved 1
that 1
however 1
long 1
i 1
might 1
remain 1
a 1
slave 1
in 1
form 1
the 1
day 1
had 1
passed 1
forever 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
be 1
a 1
slave 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
hesitate 1
to 1
let 1
it 1
be 1
known 1
of 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
who 1
expected 1
to 1
succeed 1
in 1
whipping 1
must 1
also 1
succeed 1
in 1
killing 1
me 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
never 1
again 1
what 1
might 1
be 1
called 1
fairly 1
whipped 1
though 1
i 1
remained 1
a 1
slave 1
four 1
years 1
afterwards 1
i 1
had 1
several 1
fights 1
but 1
was 1
never 1
whipped 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
surprise 1
to 1
me 1
why 1
mr 1
covey 1
did 1
not 1
immediately 1
have 1
me 1
taken 1
by 1
the 1
constable 1
to 1
the 1
whipping 1
post 1
and 1
there 1
regularly 1
whipped 1
for 1
the 1
crime 1
of 1
raising 1
my 1
hand 1
against 1
a 1
white 1
man 1
in 1
defence 1
of 1
myself 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
explanation 1
i 1
can 1
now 1
think 1
of 1
does 1
not 1
entirely 1
satisfy 1
me 1
but 1
such 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
it 1
mr 1
covey 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
most 1
unbounded 1
reputation 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
first 1
rate 1
overseer 1
and 1
negro 1
breaker 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
considerable 1
importance 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
reputation 1
was 1
at 1
stake 1
and 1
had 1
he 1
sent 1
me 1
a 1
boy 1
about 1
sixteen 1
years 1
old 1
to 1
the 1
public 1
whipping 1
post 1
his 1
reputation 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
lost 1
so 1
to 1
save 1
his 1
reputation 1
he 1
suffered 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
unpunished 1
my 1
term 1
of 1
actual 1
service 1
to 1
mr 1
edward 1
covey 1
ended 1
on 1
christmas 1
day 1
1833 1
the 1
days 1
between 1
christmas 1
and 1
new 1
year 1
s 1
day 1
are 1
allowed 1
as 1
holidays 1
and 1
accordingly 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
required 1
to 1
perform 1
any 1
labor 1
more 1
than 1
to 1
feed 1
and 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
stock 1
this 1
time 1
we 1
regarded 1
as 1
our 1
own 1
by 1
the 1
grace 1
of 1
our 1
masters 1
and 1
we 1
therefore 1
used 1
or 1
abused 1
it 1
nearly 1
as 1
we 1
pleased 1
those 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
had 1
families 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
were 1
generally 1
allowed 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
whole 1
six 1
days 1
in 1
their 1
society 1
this 1
time 1
however 1
was 1
spent 1
in 1
various 1
ways 1
the 1
staid 1
sober 1
thinking 1
and 1
industrious 1
ones 1
of 1
our 1
number 1
would 1
employ 1
themselves 1
in 1
making 1
corn 1
brooms 1
mats 1
horse 1
collars 1
and 1
baskets 1
and 1
another 1
class 1
of 1
us 1
would 1
spend 1
the 1
time 1
in 1
hunting 1
opossums 1
hares 1
and 1
coons 1
but 1
by 1
far 1
the 1
larger 1
part 1
engaged 1
in 1
such 1
sports 1
and 1
merriments 1
as 1
playing 1
ball 1
wrestling 1
running 1
foot 1
races 1
fiddling 1
dancing 1
and 1
drinking 1
whisky 1
and 1
this 1
latter 1
mode 1
of 1
spending 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
by 1
far 1
the 1
most 1
agreeable 1
to 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
our 1
masters 1
a 1
slave 1
who 1
would 1
work 1
during 1
the 1
holidays 1
was 1
considered 1
by 1
our 1
masters 1
as 1
scarcely 1
deserving 1
them 1
he 1
was 1
regarded 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
rejected 1
the 1
favor 1
of 1
his 1
master 1
it 1
was 1
deemed 1
a 1
disgrace 1
not 1
to 1
get 1
drunk 1
at 1
christmas 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
regarded 1
as 1
lazy 1
indeed 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
provided 1
himself 1
with 1
the 1
necessary 1
means 1
during 1
the 1
year 1
to 1
get 1
whisky 1
enough 1
to 1
last 1
him 1
through 1
christmas 1
from 1
what 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
these 1
holidays 1
upon 1
the 1
slave 1
i 1
believe 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
among 1
the 1
most 1
effective 1
means 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
slaveholder 1
in 1
keeping 1
down 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
insurrection 1
were 1
the 1
slaveholders 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
abandon 1
this 1
practice 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
doubt 1
it 1
would 1
lead 1
to 1
an 1
immediate 1
insurrection 1
among 1
the 1
slaves 1
these 1
holidays 1
serve 1
as 1
conductors 1
or 1
safety 1
valves 1
to 1
carry 1
off 1
the 1
rebellious 1
spirit 1
of 1
enslaved 1
humanity 1
but 1
for 1
these 1
the 1
slave 1
would 1
be 1
forced 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
wildest 1
desperation 1
and 1
woe 1
betide 1
the 1
slaveholder 1
the 1
day 1
he 1
ventures 1
to 1
remove 1
or 1
hinder 1
the 1
operation 1
of 1
those 1
conductors 1
i 1
warn 1
him 1
that 1
in 1
such 1
an 1
event 1
a 1
spirit 1
will 1
go 1
forth 1
in 1
their 1
midst 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
dreaded 1
than 1
the 1
most 1
appalling 1
earthquake 1
the 1
holidays 1
are 1
part 1
and 1
parcel 1
of 1
the 1
gross 1
fraud 1
wrong 1
and 1
inhumanity 1
of 1
slavery 1
they 1
are 1
professedly 1
a 1
custom 1
established 1
by 1
the 1
benevolence 1
of 1
the 1
slaveholders 1
but 1
i 1
undertake 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
selfishness 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
grossest 1
frauds 1
committed 1
upon 1
the 1
down 1
trodden 1
slave 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
give 1
the 1
slaves 1
this 1
time 1
because 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
their 1
work 1
during 1
its 1
continuance 1
but 1
because 1
they 1
know 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
unsafe 1
to 1
deprive 1
them 1
of 1
it 1
this 1
will 1
be 1
seen 1
by 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
slaveholders 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
their 1
slaves 1
spend 1
those 1
days 1
just 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
manner 1
as 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
as 1
glad 1
of 1
their 1
ending 1
as 1
of 1
their 1
beginning 1
their 1
object 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
to 1
disgust 1
their 1
slaves 1
with 1
freedom 1
by 1
plunging 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
lowest 1
depths 1
of 1
dissipation 1
for 1
instance 1
the 1
slaveholders 1
not 1
only 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
slave 1
drink 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
accord 1
but 1
will 1
adopt 1
various 1
plans 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
drunk 1
one 1
plan 1
is 1
to 1
make 1
bets 1
on 1
their 1
slaves 1
as 1
to 1
who 1
can 1
drink 1
the 1
most 1
whisky 1
without 1
getting 1
drunk 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
they 1
succeed 1
in 1
getting 1
whole 1
multitudes 1
to 1
drink 1
to 1
excess 1
thus 1
when 1
the 1
slave 1
asks 1
for 1
virtuous 1
freedom 1
the 1
cunning 1
slaveholder 1
knowing 1
his 1
ignorance 1
cheats 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
dose 1
of 1
vicious 1
dissipation 1
artfully 1
labelled 1
with 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
liberty 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
us 1
used 1
to 1
drink 1
it 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
just 1
what 1
might 1
be 1
supposed 1
many 1
of 1
us 1
were 1
led 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
little 1
to 1
choose 1
between 1
liberty 1
and 1
slavery 1
we 1
felt 1
and 1
very 1
properly 1
too 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
almost 1
as 1
well 1
be 1
slaves 1
to 1
man 1
as 1
to 1
rum 1
so 1
when 1
the 1
holidays 1
ended 1
we 1
staggered 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
filth 1
of 1
our 1
wallowing 1
took 1
a 1
long 1
breath 1
and 1
marched 1
to 1
the 1
field 1
feeling 1
upon 1
the 1
whole 1
rather 1
glad 1
to 1
go 1
from 1
what 1
our 1
master 1
had 1
deceived 1
us 1
into 1
a 1
belief 1
was 1
freedom 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
slavery 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
this 1
mode 1
of 1
treatment 1
is 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
system 1
of 1
fraud 1
and 1
inhumanity 1
of 1
slavery 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
the 1
mode 1
here 1
adopted 1
to 1
disgust 1
the 1
slave 1
with 1
freedom 1
by 1
allowing 1
him 1
to 1
see 1
only 1
the 1
abuse 1
of 1
it 1
is 1
carried 1
out 1
in 1
other 1
things 1
for 1
instance 1
a 1
slave 1
loves 1
molasses 1
he 1
steals 1
some 1
his 1
master 1
in 1
many 1
cases 1
goes 1
off 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
buys 1
a 1
large 1
quantity 1
he 1
returns 1
takes 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
commands 1
the 1
slave 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
molasses 1
until 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
is 1
made 1
sick 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
mention 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
same 1
mode 1
is 1
sometimes 1
adopted 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
slaves 1
refrain 1
from 1
asking 1
for 1
more 1
food 1
than 1
their 1
regular 1
allowance 1
a 1
slave 1
runs 1
through 1
his 1
allowance 1
and 1
applies 1
for 1
more 1
his 1
master 1
is 1
enraged 1
at 1
him 1
but 1
not 1
willing 1
to 1
send 1
him 1
off 1
without 1
food 1
gives 1
him 1
more 1
than 1
is 1
necessary 1
and 1
compels 1
him 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
within 1
a 1
given 1
time 1
then 1
if 1
he 1
complains 1
that 1
he 1
cannot 1
eat 1
it 1
he 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
satisfied 1
neither 1
full 1
nor 1
fasting 1
and 1
is 1
whipped 1
for 1
being 1
hard 1
to 1
please 1
i 1
have 1
an 1
abundance 1
of 1
such 1
illustrations 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
principle 1
drawn 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
observation 1
but 1
think 1
the 1
cases 1
i 1
have 1
cited 1
sufficient 1
the 1
practice 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
common 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
january 1
1834 1
i 1
left 1
mr 1
covey 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
mr 1
william 1
freeland 1
who 1
lived 1
about 1
three 1
miles 1
from 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
i 1
soon 1
found 1
mr 1
freeland 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
man 1
from 1
mr 1
covey 1
though 1
not 1
rich 1
he 1
was 1
what 1
would 1
be 1
called 1
an 1
educated 1
southern 1
gentleman 1
mr 1
covey 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
shown 1
was 1
a 1
well 1
trained 1
negro 1
breaker 1
and 1
slave 1
driver 1
the 1
former 1
slaveholder 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
seemed 1
to 1
possess 1
some 1
regard 1
for 1
honor 1
some 1
reverence 1
for 1
justice 1
and 1
some 1
respect 1
for 1
humanity 1
the 1
latter 1
seemed 1
totally 1
insensible 1
to 1
all 1
such 1
sentiments 1
mr 1
freeland 1
had 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
faults 1
peculiar 1
to 1
slaveholders 1
such 1
as 1
being 1
very 1
passionate 1
and 1
fretful 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
do 1
him 1
the 1
justice 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
free 1
from 1
those 1
degrading 1
vices 1
to 1
which 1
mr 1
covey 1
was 1
constantly 1
addicted 1
the 1
one 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
frank 1
and 1
we 1
always 1
knew 1
where 1
to 1
find 1
him 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
artful 1
deceiver 1
and 1
could 1
be 1
understood 1
only 1
by 1
such 1
as 1
were 1
skilful 1
enough 1
to 1
detect 1
his 1
cunningly 1
devised 1
frauds 1
another 1
advantage 1
i 1
gained 1
in 1
my 1
new 1
master 1
was 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
pretensions 1
to 1
or 1
profession 1
of 1
religion 1
and 1
this 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
was 1
truly 1
a 1
great 1
advantage 1
i 1
assert 1
most 1
unhesitatingly 1
that 1
the 1
religion 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
is 1
a 1
mere 1
covering 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
horrid 1
crimes 1
a 1
justifier 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
appalling 1
barbarity 1
a 1
sanctifier 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
hateful 1
frauds 1
and 1
a 1
dark 1
shelter 1
under 1
which 1
the 1
darkest 1
foulest 1
grossest 1
and 1
most 1
infernal 1
deeds 1
of 1
slaveholders 1
find 1
the 1
strongest 1
protection 1
were 1
i 1
to 1
be 1
again 1
reduced 1
to 1
the 1
chains 1
of 1
slavery 1
next 1
to 1
that 1
enslavement 1
i 1
should 1
regard 1
being 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
a 1
religious 1
master 1
the 1
greatest 1
calamity 1
that 1
could 1
befall 1
me 1
for 1
of 1
all 1
slaveholders 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
met 1
religious 1
slaveholders 1
are 1
the 1
worst 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
found 1
them 1
the 1
meanest 1
and 1
basest 1
the 1
most 1
cruel 1
and 1
cowardly 1
of 1
all 1
others 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
unhappy 1
lot 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
belong 1
to 1
a 1
religious 1
slaveholder 1
but 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
a 1
community 1
of 1
such 1
religionists 1
very 1
near 1
mr 1
freeland 1
lived 1
the 1
rev 1
daniel 1
weeden 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
neighborhood 1
lived 1
the 1
rev 1
rigby 1
hopkins 1
these 1
were 1
members 1
and 1
ministers 1
in 1
the 1
reformed 1
methodist 1
church 1
mr 1
weeden 1
owned 1
among 1
others 1
a 1
woman 1
slave 1
whose 1
name 1
i 1
have 1
forgotten 1
this 1
woman 1
s 1
back 1
for 1
weeks 1
was 1
kept 1
literally 1
raw 1
made 1
so 1
by 1
the 1
lash 1
of 1
this 1
merciless 1
_religious_ 1
wretch 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
hire 1
hands 1
his 1
maxim 1
was 1
behave 1
well 1
or 1
behave 1
ill 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
duty 1
of 1
a 1
master 1
occasionally 1
to 1
whip 1
a 1
slave 1
to 1
remind 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
master 1
s 1
authority 1
such 1
was 1
his 1
theory 1
and 1
such 1
his 1
practice 1
mr 1
hopkins 1
was 1
even 1
worse 1
than 1
mr 1
weeden 1
his 1
chief 1
boast 1
was 1
his 1
ability 1
to 1
manage 1
slaves 1
the 1
peculiar 1
feature 1
of 1
his 1
government 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
whipping 1
slaves 1
in 1
advance 1
of 1
deserving 1
it 1
he 1
always 1
managed 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
or 1
more 1
of 1
his 1
slaves 1
to 1
whip 1
every 1
monday 1
morning 1
he 1
did 1
this 1
to 1
alarm 1
their 1
fears 1
and 1
strike 1
terror 1
into 1
those 1
who 1
escaped 1
his 1
plan 1
was 1
to 1
whip 1
for 1
the 1
smallest 1
offences 1
to 1
prevent 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
large 1
ones 1
mr 1
hopkins 1
could 1
always 1
find 1
some 1
excuse 1
for 1
whipping 1
a 1
slave 1
it 1
would 1
astonish 1
one 1
unaccustomed 1
to 1
a 1
slaveholding 1
life 1
to 1
see 1
with 1
what 1
wonderful 1
ease 1
a 1
slaveholder 1
can 1
find 1
things 1
of 1
which 1
to 1
make 1
occasion 1
to 1
whip 1
a 1
slave 1
a 1
mere 1
look 1
word 1
or 1
motion 1
a 1
mistake 1
accident 1
or 1
want 1
of 1
power 1
are 1
all 1
matters 1
for 1
which 1
a 1
slave 1
may 1
be 1
whipped 1
at 1
any 1
time 1
does 1
a 1
slave 1
look 1
dissatisfied 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
he 1
has 1
the 1
devil 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
whipped 1
out 1
does 1
he 1
speak 1
loudly 1
when 1
spoken 1
to 1
by 1
his 1
master 1
then 1
he 1
is 1
getting 1
high 1
minded 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
down 1
a 1
button 1
hole 1
lower 1
does 1
he 1
forget 1
to 1
pull 1
off 1
his 1
hat 1
at 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
a 1
white 1
person 1
then 1
he 1
is 1
wanting 1
in 1
reverence 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
whipped 1
for 1
it 1
does 1
he 1
ever 1
venture 1
to 1
vindicate 1
his 1
conduct 1
when 1
censured 1
for 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
is 1
guilty 1
of 1
impudence 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
crimes 1
of 1
which 1
a 1
slave 1
can 1
be 1
guilty 1
does 1
he 1
ever 1
venture 1
to 1
suggest 1
a 1
different 1
mode 1
of 1
doing 1
things 1
from 1
that 1
pointed 1
out 1
by 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
is 1
indeed 1
presumptuous 1
and 1
getting 1
above 1
himself 1
and 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
flogging 1
will 1
do 1
for 1
him 1
does 1
he 1
while 1
ploughing 1
break 1
a 1
plough 1
or 1
while 1
hoeing 1
break 1
a 1
hoe 1
it 1
is 1
owing 1
to 1
his 1
carelessness 1
and 1
for 1
it 1
a 1
slave 1
must 1
always 1
be 1
whipped 1
mr 1
hopkins 1
could 1
always 1
find 1
something 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
to 1
justify 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
lash 1
and 1
he 1
seldom 1
failed 1
to 1
embrace 1
such 1
opportunities 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
county 1
with 1
whom 1
the 1
slaves 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
getting 1
their 1
own 1
home 1
would 1
not 1
prefer 1
to 1
live 1
rather 1
than 1
with 1
this 1
rev 1
mr 1
hopkins 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
man 1
any 1
where 1
round 1
who 1
made 1
higher 1
professions 1
of 1
religion 1
or 1
was 1
more 1
active 1
in 1
revivals 1
more 1
attentive 1
to 1
the 1
class 1
love 1
feast 1
prayer 1
and 1
preaching 1
meetings 1
or 1
more 1
devotional 1
in 1
his 1
family 1
that 1
prayed 1
earlier 1
later 1
louder 1
and 1
longer 1
than 1
this 1
same 1
reverend 1
slave 1
driver 1
rigby 1
hopkins 1
but 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
mr 1
freeland 1
and 1
to 1
my 1
experience 1
while 1
in 1
his 1
employment 1
he 1
like 1
mr 1
covey 1
gave 1
us 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
but 1
unlike 1
mr 1
covey 1
he 1
also 1
gave 1
us 1
sufficient 1
time 1
to 1
take 1
our 1
meals 1
he 1
worked 1
us 1
hard 1
but 1
always 1
between 1
sunrise 1
and 1
sunset 1
he 1
required 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
work 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
but 1
gave 1
us 1
good 1
tools 1
with 1
which 1
to 1
work 1
his 1
farm 1
was 1
large 1
but 1
he 1
employed 1
hands 1
enough 1
to 1
work 1
it 1
and 1
with 1
ease 1
compared 1
with 1
many 1
of 1
his 1
neighbors 1
my 1
treatment 1
while 1
in 1
his 1
employment 1
was 1
heavenly 1
compared 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
experienced 1
at 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
mr 1
edward 1
covey 1
mr 1
freeland 1
was 1
himself 1
the 1
owner 1
of 1
but 1
two 1
slaves 1
their 1
names 1
were 1
henry 1
harris 1
and 1
john 1
harris 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
hands 1
he 1
hired 1
these 1
consisted 1
of 1
myself 1
sandy 1
jenkins 1
and 1
handy 1
caldwell 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
same 1
man 1
who 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
roots 1
to 1
prevent 1
my 1
being 1
whipped 1
by 1
mr 1
covey 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
clever 1
soul 1
we 1
used 1
frequently 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
fight 1
with 1
covey 1
and 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
we 1
did 1
so 1
he 1
would 1
claim 1
my 1
success 1
as 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
roots 1
which 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
this 1
superstition 1
is 1
very 1
common 1
among 1
the 1
more 1
ignorant 1
slaves 1
a 1
slave 1
seldom 1
dies 1
but 1
that 1
his 1
death 1
is 1
attributed 1
to 1
trickery 1
henry 1
and 1
john 1
were 1
quite 1
intelligent 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
little 1
while 1
after 1
i 1
went 1
there 1
i 1
succeeded 1
in 1
creating 1
in 1
them 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
to 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
read 1
this 1
desire 1
soon 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
others 1
also 1
they 1
very 1
soon 1
mustered 1
up 1
some 1
old 1
spelling 1
books 1
and 1
nothing 1
would 1
do 1
but 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
keep 1
a 1
sabbath 1
school 1
i 1
agreed 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
accordingly 1
devoted 1
my 1
sundays 1
to 1
teaching 1
these 1
my 1
loved 1
fellow 1
slaves 1
how 1
to 1
read 1
neither 1
of 1
them 1
knew 1
his 1
letters 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
there 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
slaves 1
of 1
the 1
neighboring 1
farms 1
found 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
and 1
also 1
availed 1
themselves 1
of 1
this 1
little 1
opportunity 1
to 1
learn 1
to 1
read 1
it 1
was 1
understood 1
among 1
all 1
who 1
came 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
as 1
little 1
display 1
about 1
it 1
as 1
possible 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
to 1
keep 1
our 1
religious 1
masters 1
at 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
instead 1
of 1
spending 1
the 1
sabbath 1
in 1
wrestling 1
boxing 1
and 1
drinking 1
whisky 1
we 1
were 1
trying 1
to 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
god 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
much 1
rather 1
see 1
us 1
engaged 1
in 1
those 1
degrading 1
sports 1
than 1
to 1
see 1
us 1
behaving 1
like 1
intellectual 1
moral 1
and 1
accountable 1
beings 1
my 1
blood 1
boils 1
as 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
bloody 1
manner 1
in 1
which 1
messrs 1
wright 1
fairbanks 1
and 1
garrison 1
west 1
both 1
class 1
leaders 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
many 1
others 1
rushed 1
in 1
upon 1
us 1
with 1
sticks 1
and 1
stones 1
and 1
broke 1
up 1
our 1
virtuous 1
little 1
sabbath 1
school 1
at 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
all 1
calling 1
themselves 1
christians 1
humble 1
followers 1
of 1
the 1
lord 1
jesus 1
christ 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
again 1
digressing 1
i 1
held 1
my 1
sabbath 1
school 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
a 1
free 1
colored 1
man 1
whose 1
name 1
i 1
deem 1
it 1
imprudent 1
to 1
mention 1
for 1
should 1
it 1
be 1
known 1
it 1
might 1
embarrass 1
him 1
greatly 1
though 1
the 1
crime 1
of 1
holding 1
the 1
school 1
was 1
committed 1
ten 1
years 1
ago 1
i 1
had 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
over 1
forty 1
scholars 1
and 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
right 1
sort 1
ardently 1
desiring 1
to 1
learn 1
they 1
were 1
of 1
all 1
ages 1
though 1
mostly 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
i 1
look 1
back 1
to 1
those 1
sundays 1
with 1
an 1
amount 1
of 1
pleasure 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
expressed 1
they 1
were 1
great 1
days 1
to 1
my 1
soul 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
instructing 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
slaves 1
was 1
the 1
sweetest 1
engagement 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
ever 1
blessed 1
we 1
loved 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
to 1
leave 1
them 1
at 1
the 1
close 1
of 1
the 1
sabbath 1
was 1
a 1
severe 1
cross 1
indeed 1
when 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
these 1
precious 1
souls 1
are 1
to 1
day 1
shut 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
prison 1
house 1
of 1
slavery 1
my 1
feelings 1
overcome 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
almost 1
ready 1
to 1
ask 1
does 1
a 1
righteous 1
god 1
govern 1
the 1
universe 1
and 1
for 1
what 1
does 1
he 1
hold 1
the 1
thunders 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
if 1
not 1
to 1
smite 1
the 1
oppressor 1
and 1
deliver 1
the 1
spoiled 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
spoiler 1
these 1
dear 1
souls 1
came 1
not 1
to 1
sabbath 1
school 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
popular 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
nor 1
did 1
i 1
teach 1
them 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
reputable 1
to 1
be 1
thus 1
engaged 1
every 1
moment 1
they 1
spent 1
in 1
that 1
school 1
they 1
were 1
liable 1
to 1
be 1
taken 1
up 1
and 1
given 1
thirty 1
nine 1
lashes 1
they 1
came 1
because 1
they 1
wished 1
to 1
learn 1
their 1
minds 1
had 1
been 1
starved 1
by 1
their 1
cruel 1
masters 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
shut 1
up 1
in 1
mental 1
darkness 1
i 1
taught 1
them 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
delight 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
to 1
be 1
doing 1
something 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
bettering 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
my 1
race 1
i 1
kept 1
up 1
my 1
school 1
nearly 1
the 1
whole 1
year 1
i 1
lived 1
with 1
mr 1
freeland 1
and 1
beside 1
my 1
sabbath 1
school 1
i 1
devoted 1
three 1
evenings 1
in 1
the 1
week 1
during 1
the 1
winter 1
to 1
teaching 1
the 1
slaves 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
happiness 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
several 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
came 1
to 1
sabbath 1
school 1
learned 1
how 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
that 1
one 1
at 1
least 1
is 1
now 1
free 1
through 1
my 1
agency 1
the 1
year 1
passed 1
off 1
smoothly 1
it 1
seemed 1
only 1
about 1
half 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
year 1
which 1
preceded 1
it 1
i 1
went 1
through 1
it 1
without 1
receiving 1
a 1
single 1
blow 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
mr 1
freeland 1
the 1
credit 1
of 1
being 1
the 1
best 1
master 1
i 1
ever 1
had 1
_till 1
i 1
became 1
my 1
own 1
master 1
_ 1
for 1
the 1
ease 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
year 1
i 1
was 1
however 1
somewhat 1
indebted 1
to 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
slaves 1
they 1
were 1
noble 1
souls 1
they 1
not 1
only 1
possessed 1
loving 1
hearts 1
but 1
brave 1
ones 1
we 1
were 1
linked 1
and 1
interlinked 1
with 1
each 1
other 1
i 1
loved 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
love 1
stronger 1
than 1
any 1
thing 1
i 1
have 1
experienced 1
since 1
it 1
is 1
sometimes 1
said 1
that 1
we 1
slaves 1
do 1
not 1
love 1
and 1
confide 1
in 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
this 1
assertion 1
i 1
can 1
say 1
i 1
never 1
loved 1
any 1
or 1
confided 1
in 1
any 1
people 1
more 1
than 1
my 1
fellow 1
slaves 1
and 1
especially 1
those 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
lived 1
at 1
mr 1
freeland 1
s 1
i 1
believe 1
we 1
would 1
have 1
died 1
for 1
each 1
other 1
we 1
never 1
undertook 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
thing 1
of 1
any 1
importance 1
without 1
a 1
mutual 1
consultation 1
we 1
never 1
moved 1
separately 1
we 1
were 1
one 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
so 1
by 1
our 1
tempers 1
and 1
dispositions 1
as 1
by 1
the 1
mutual 1
hardships 1
to 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
necessarily 1
subjected 1
by 1
our 1
condition 1
as 1
slaves 1
at 1
the 1
close 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
1834 1
mr 1
freeland 1
again 1
hired 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
master 1
for 1
the 1
year 1
1835 1
but 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
want 1
to 1
live 1
_upon 1
free 1
land_ 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
_with 1
freeland 1
_ 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
content 1
therefore 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
him 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
slaveholder 1
i 1
began 1
with 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
to 1
prepare 1
myself 1
for 1
a 1
final 1
struggle 1
which 1
should 1
decide 1
my 1
fate 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
the 1
other 1
my 1
tendency 1
was 1
upward 1
i 1
was 1
fast 1
approaching 1
manhood 1
and 1
year 1
after 1
year 1
had 1
passed 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
a 1
slave 1
these 1
thoughts 1
roused 1
me 1
i 1
must 1
do 1
something 1
i 1
therefore 1
resolved 1
that 1
1835 1
should 1
not 1
pass 1
without 1
witnessing 1
an 1
attempt 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
to 1
secure 1
my 1
liberty 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
willing 1
to 1
cherish 1
this 1
determination 1
alone 1
my 1
fellow 1
slaves 1
were 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
participate 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
my 1
life 1
giving 1
determination 1
i 1
therefore 1
though 1
with 1
great 1
prudence 1
commenced 1
early 1
to 1
ascertain 1
their 1
views 1
and 1
feelings 1
in 1
regard 1
to 1
their 1
condition 1
and 1
to 1
imbue 1
their 1
minds 1
with 1
thoughts 1
of 1
freedom 1
i 1
bent 1
myself 1
to 1
devising 1
ways 1
and 1
means 1
for 1
our 1
escape 1
and 1
meanwhile 1
strove 1
on 1
all 1
fitting 1
occasions 1
to 1
impress 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
gross 1
fraud 1
and 1
inhumanity 1
of 1
slavery 1
i 1
went 1
first 1
to 1
henry 1
next 1
to 1
john 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
others 1
i 1
found 1
in 1
them 1
all 1
warm 1
hearts 1
and 1
noble 1
spirits 1
they 1
were 1
ready 1
to 1
hear 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
act 1
when 1
a 1
feasible 1
plan 1
should 1
be 1
proposed 1
this 1
was 1
what 1
i 1
wanted 1
i 1
talked 1
to 1
them 1
of 1
our 1
want 1
of 1
manhood 1
if 1
we 1
submitted 1
to 1
our 1
enslavement 1
without 1
at 1
least 1
one 1
noble 1
effort 1
to 1
be 1
free 1
we 1
met 1
often 1
and 1
consulted 1
frequently 1
and 1
told 1
our 1
hopes 1
and 1
fears 1
recounted 1
the 1
difficulties 1
real 1
and 1
imagined 1
which 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
called 1
on 1
to 1
meet 1
at 1
times 1
we 1
were 1
almost 1
disposed 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
content 1
ourselves 1
with 1
our 1
wretched 1
lot 1
at 1
others 1
we 1
were 1
firm 1
and 1
unbending 1
in 1
our 1
determination 1
to 1
go 1
whenever 1
we 1
suggested 1
any 1
plan 1
there 1
was 1
shrinking 1
the 1
odds 1
were 1
fearful 1
our 1
path 1
was 1
beset 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
obstacles 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
succeeded 1
in 1
gaining 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
our 1
right 1
to 1
be 1
free 1
was 1
yet 1
questionable 1
we 1
were 1
yet 1
liable 1
to 1
be 1
returned 1
to 1
bondage 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
no 1
spot 1
this 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
ocean 1
where 1
we 1
could 1
be 1
free 1
we 1
knew 1
nothing 1
about 1
canada 1
our 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
north 1
did 1
not 1
extend 1
farther 1
than 1
new 1
york 1
and 1
to 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
be 1
forever 1
harassed 1
with 1
the 1
frightful 1
liability 1
of 1
being 1
returned 1
to 1
slavery 1
with 1
the 1
certainty 1
of 1
being 1
treated 1
tenfold 1
worse 1
than 1
before 1
the 1
thought 1
was 1
truly 1
a 1
horrible 1
one 1
and 1
one 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
easy 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
case 1
sometimes 1
stood 1
thus 1
at 1
every 1
gate 1
through 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
pass 1
we 1
saw 1
a 1
watchman 1
at 1
every 1
ferry 1
a 1
guard 1
on 1
every 1
bridge 1
a 1
sentinel 1
and 1
in 1
every 1
wood 1
a 1
patrol 1
we 1
were 1
hemmed 1
in 1
upon 1
every 1
side 1
here 1
were 1
the 1
difficulties 1
real 1
or 1
imagined 1
the 1
good 1
to 1
be 1
sought 1
and 1
the 1
evil 1
to 1
be 1
shunned 1
on 1
the 1
one 1
hand 1
there 1
stood 1
slavery 1
a 1
stern 1
reality 1
glaring 1
frightfully 1
upon 1
us 1
its 1
robes 1
already 1
crimsoned 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
millions 1
and 1
even 1
now 1
feasting 1
itself 1
greedily 1
upon 1
our 1
own 1
flesh 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
away 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
distance 1
under 1
the 1
flickering 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
north 1
star 1
behind 1
some 1
craggy 1
hill 1
or 1
snow 1
covered 1
mountain 1
stood 1
a 1
doubtful 1
freedom 1
half 1
frozen 1
beckoning 1
us 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
share 1
its 1
hospitality 1
this 1
in 1
itself 1
was 1
sometimes 1
enough 1
to 1
stagger 1
us 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
permitted 1
ourselves 1
to 1
survey 1
the 1
road 1
we 1
were 1
frequently 1
appalled 1
upon 1
either 1
side 1
we 1
saw 1
grim 1
death 1
assuming 1
the 1
most 1
horrid 1
shapes 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
starvation 1
causing 1
us 1
to 1
eat 1
our 1
own 1
flesh 1
now 1
we 1
were 1
contending 1
with 1
the 1
waves 1
and 1
were 1
drowned 1
now 1
we 1
were 1
overtaken 1
and 1
torn 1
to 1
pieces 1
by 1
the 1
fangs 1
of 1
the 1
terrible 1
bloodhound 1
we 1
were 1
stung 1
by 1
scorpions 1
chased 1
by 1
wild 1
beasts 1
bitten 1
by 1
snakes 1
and 1
finally 1
after 1
having 1
nearly 1
reached 1
the 1
desired 1
spot 1
after 1
swimming 1
rivers 1
encountering 1
wild 1
beasts 1
sleeping 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
suffering 1
hunger 1
and 1
nakedness 1
we 1
were 1
overtaken 1
by 1
our 1
pursuers 1
and 1
in 1
our 1
resistance 1
we 1
were 1
shot 1
dead 1
upon 1
the 1
spot 1
i 1
say 1
this 1
picture 1
sometimes 1
appalled 1
us 1
and 1
made 1
us 1
rather 1
bear 1
those 1
ills 1
we 1
had 1
than 1
fly 1
to 1
others 1
that 1
we 1
knew 1
not 1
of 1
in 1
coming 1
to 1
a 1
fixed 1
determination 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
we 1
did 1
more 1
than 1
patrick 1
henry 1
when 1
he 1
resolved 1
upon 1
liberty 1
or 1
death 1
with 1
us 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
doubtful 1
liberty 1
at 1
most 1
and 1
almost 1
certain 1
death 1
if 1
we 1
failed 1
for 1
my 1
part 1
i 1
should 1
prefer 1
death 1
to 1
hopeless 1
bondage 1
sandy 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
number 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
notion 1
but 1
still 1
encouraged 1
us 1
our 1
company 1
then 1
consisted 1
of 1
henry 1
harris 1
john 1
harris 1
henry 1
bailey 1
charles 1
roberts 1
and 1
myself 1
henry 1
bailey 1
was 1
my 1
uncle 1
and 1
belonged 1
to 1
my 1
master 1
charles 1
married 1
my 1
aunt 1
he 1
belonged 1
to 1
my 1
master 1

father 1
in 1
law 1
mr 1
william 1
hamilton 1
the 1
plan 1
we 1
finally 1
concluded 1
upon 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
large 1
canoe 1
belonging 1
to 1
mr 1
hamilton 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
saturday 1
night 1
previous 1
to 1
easter 1
holidays 1
paddle 1
directly 1
up 1
the 1
chesapeake 1
bay 1
on 1
our 1
arrival 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
bay 1
a 1
distance 1
of 1
seventy 1
or 1
eighty 1
miles 1
from 1
where 1
we 1
lived 1
it 1
was 1
our 1
purpose 1
to 1
turn 1
our 1
canoe 1
adrift 1
and 1
follow 1
the 1
guidance 1
of 1
the 1
north 1
star 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
beyond 1
the 1
limits 1
of 1
maryland 1
our 1
reason 1
for 1
taking 1
the 1
water 1
route 1
was 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
less 1
liable 1
to 1
be 1
suspected 1
as 1
runaways 1
we 1
hoped 1
to 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
fishermen 1
whereas 1
if 1
we 1
should 1
take 1
the 1
land 1
route 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
subjected 1
to 1
interruptions 1
of 1
almost 1
every 1
kind 1
any 1
one 1
having 1
a 1
white 1
face 1
and 1
being 1
so 1
disposed 1
could 1
stop 1
us 1
and 1
subject 1
us 1
to 1
examination 1
the 1
week 1
before 1
our 1
intended 1
start 1
i 1
wrote 1
several 1
protections 1
one 1
for 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
remember 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
following 1
words 1
to 1
wit 1
this 1
is 1
to 1
certify 1
that 1
i 1
the 1
undersigned 1
have 1
given 1
the 1
bearer 1
my 1
servant 1
full 1
liberty 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
baltimore 1
and 1
spend 1

easter 1
holidays 1

william 1
hamilton 1
near 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
in 1
talbot 1
county 1
maryland 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
baltimore 1
but 1
in 1
going 1
up 1
the 1
bay 1
we 1
went 1
toward 1
baltimore 1
and 1
these 1
protections 1
were 1
only 1
intended 1
to 1
protect 1
us 1
while 1
on 1
the 1
bay 1
as 1
the 1
time 1
drew 1
near 1
for 1
our 1
departure 1
our 1
anxiety 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
intense 1
it 1
was 1
truly 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
with 1
us 1
the 1
strength 1
of 1
our 1
determination 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
fully 1
tested 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
active 1
in 1
explaining 1
every 1
difficulty 1
removing 1
every 1
doubt 1
dispelling 1
every 1
fear 1
and 1
inspiring 1
all 1
with 1
the 1
firmness 1
indispensable 1
to 1
success 1
in 1
our 1
undertaking 1
assuring 1
them 1
that 1
half 1
was 1
gained 1
the 1
instant 1
we 1
made 1
the 1
move 1
we 1
had 1
talked 1
long 1
enough 1
we 1
were 1
now 1
ready 1
to 1
move 1
if 1
not 1
now 1
we 1
never 1
should 1
be 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
move 1
now 1
we 1
had 1
as 1
well 1
fold 1
our 1
arms 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
acknowledge 1
ourselves 1
fit 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
slaves 1
this 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
were 1
prepared 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
every 1
man 1
stood 1
firm 1
and 1
at 1
our 1
last 1
meeting 1
we 1
pledged 1
ourselves 1
afresh 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
solemn 1
manner 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
appointed 1
we 1
would 1
certainly 1
start 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
freedom 1
this 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
week 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
off 1
we 1
went 1
as 1
usual 1
to 1
our 1
several 1
fields 1
of 1
labor 1
but 1
with 1
bosoms 1
highly 1
agitated 1
with 1
thoughts 1
of 1
our 1
truly 1
hazardous 1
undertaking 1
we 1
tried 1
to 1
conceal 1
our 1
feelings 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
succeeded 1
very 1
well 1
after 1
a 1
painful 1
waiting 1
the 1
saturday 1
morning 1
whose 1
night 1
was 1
to 1
witness 1
our 1
departure 1
came 1
i 1
hailed 1
it 1
with 1
joy 1
bring 1
what 1
of 1
sadness 1
it 1
might 1
friday 1
night 1
was 1
a 1
sleepless 1
one 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
probably 1
felt 1
more 1
anxious 1
than 1
the 1
rest 1
because 1
i 1
was 1
by 1
common 1
consent 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
affair 1
the 1
responsibility 1
of 1
success 1
or 1
failure 1
lay 1
heavily 1
upon 1
me 1
the 1
glory 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
and 1
the 1
confusion 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
were 1
alike 1
mine 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
hours 1
of 1
that 1
morning 1
were 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
never 1
experienced 1
before 1
and 1
hope 1
never 1
to 1
again 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
we 1
went 1
as 1
usual 1
to 1
the 1
field 1
we 1
were 1
spreading 1
manure 1
and 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
while 1
thus 1
engaged 1
i 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
with 1
an 1
indescribable 1
feeling 1
in 1
the 1
fulness 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
turned 1
to 1
sandy 1
who 1
was 1
near 1
by 1
and 1
said 1
we 1
are 1
betrayed 1
well 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
thought 1
has 1
this 1
moment 1
struck 1
me 1
we 1
said 1
no 1
more 1
i 1
was 1
never 1
more 1
certain 1
of 1
any 1
thing 1
the 1
horn 1
was 1
blown 1
as 1
usual 1
and 1
we 1
went 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
field 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
breakfast 1
i 1
went 1
for 1
the 1
form 1
more 1
than 1
for 1
want 1
of 1
any 1
thing 1
to 1
eat 1
that 1
morning 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
in 1
looking 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
lane 1
gate 1
i 1
saw 1
four 1
white 1
men 1
with 1
two 1
colored 1
men 1
the 1
white 1
men 1
were 1
on 1
horseback 1
and 1
the 1
colored 1
ones 1
were 1
walking 1
behind 1
as 1
if 1
tied 1
i 1
watched 1
them 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
till 1
they 1
got 1
up 1
to 1
our 1
lane 1
gate 1
here 1
they 1
halted 1
and 1
tied 1
the 1
colored 1
men 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
post 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
certain 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
in 1
rode 1
mr 1
hamilton 1
with 1
a 1
speed 1
betokening 1
great 1
excitement 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
inquired 1
if 1
master 1
william 1
was 1
in 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
barn 1
mr 1
hamilton 1
without 1
dismounting 1
rode 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
barn 1
with 1
extraordinary 1
speed 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
and 1
mr 1
freeland 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
three 1
constables 1
rode 1
up 1
and 1
in 1
great 1
haste 1
dismounted 1
tied 1
their 1
horses 1
and 1
met 1
master 1
william 1
and 1
mr 1
hamilton 1
returning 1
from 1
the 1
barn 1
and 1
after 1
talking 1
awhile 1
they 1
all 1
walked 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
but 1
myself 1
and 1
john 1
henry 1
and 1
sandy 1
were 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
barn 1
mr 1
freeland 1
put 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
called 1
me 1
by 1
name 1
saying 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
gentlemen 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
who 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
i 1
stepped 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
inquired 1
what 1
they 1
wanted 1
they 1
at 1
once 1
seized 1
me 1
and 1
without 1
giving 1
me 1
any 1
satisfaction 1
tied 1
me 1
lashing 1
my 1
hands 1
closely 1
together 1
i 1
insisted 1
upon 1
knowing 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
they 1
at 1
length 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
learned 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
a 1
scrape 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
examined 1
before 1
my 1
master 1
and 1
if 1
their 1
information 1
proved 1
false 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
hurt 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
they 1
succeeded 1
in 1
tying 1
john 1
they 1
then 1
turned 1
to 1
henry 1
who 1
had 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
returned 1
and 1
commanded 1
him 1
to 1
cross 1
his 1
hands 1
i 1
won 1
t 1
said 1
henry 1
in 1
a 1
firm 1
tone 1
indicating 1
his 1
readiness 1
to 1
meet 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
his 1
refusal 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
said 1
tom 1
graham 1
the 1
constable 1
no 1
i 1
won 1
t 1
said 1
henry 1
in 1
a 1
still 1
stronger 1
tone 1
with 1
this 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
constables 1
pulled 1
out 1
their 1
shining 1
pistols 1
and 1
swore 1
by 1
their 1
creator 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
cross 1
his 1
hands 1
or 1
kill 1
him 1
each 1
cocked 1
his 1
pistol 1
and 1
with 1
fingers 1
on 1
the 1
trigger 1
walked 1
up 1
to 1
henry 1
saying 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
cross 1
his 1
hands 1
they 1
would 1
blow 1
his 1
damned 1
heart 1
out 1
shoot 1
me 1
shoot 1
me 1
said 1

t 1
kill 1
me 1
but 1
once 1
shoot 1
shoot 1
and 1
be 1
damned 1
_i 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
tied 1
_ 1
this 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
tone 1
of 1
loud 1
defiance 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
with 1
a 1
motion 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
lightning 1
he 1
with 1
one 1
single 1
stroke 1
dashed 1
the 1
pistols 1
from 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
each 1
constable 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
this 1
all 1
hands 1
fell 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
after 1
beating 1
him 1
some 1
time 1
they 1
finally 1
overpowered 1
him 1
and 1
got 1
him 1
tied 1
during 1
the 1
scuffle 1
i 1
managed 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
my 1
pass 1
out 1
and 1
without 1
being 1
discovered 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
now 1
tied 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
leave 1
for 1
easton 1
jail 1
betsy 1
freeland 1
mother 1
of 1
william 1
freeland 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
her 1
hands 1
full 1
of 1
biscuits 1
and 1
divided 1
them 1
between 1
henry 1
and 1
john 1
she 1
then 1
delivered 1
herself 1
of 1
a 1
speech 1
to 1
the 1
following 1
effect 1
addressing 1
herself 1
to 1
me 1
she 1
said 1
_you 1
devil 1
you 1
yellow 1
devil 1
_ 1
it 1
was 1
you 1
that 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
henry 1
and 1
john 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
for 1
you 1
you 1
long 1
legged 1
mulatto 1
devil 1
henry 1
nor 1
john 1
would 1
never 1
have 1
thought 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
i 1
made 1
no 1
reply 1
and 1
was 1
immediately 1
hurried 1
off 1
towards 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
just 1
a 1
moment 1
previous 1
to 1
the 1
scuffle 1
with 1
henry 1
mr 1
hamilton 1
suggested 1
the 1
propriety 1
of 1
making 1
a 1
search 1
for 1
the 1
protections 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
understood 1
frederick 1
had 1
written 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
but 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
carrying 1
his 1
proposal 1
into 1
effect 1
his 1
aid 1
was 1
needed 1
in 1
helping 1
to 1
tie 1
henry 1
and 1
the 1
excitement 1
attending 1
the 1
scuffle 1
caused 1
them 1
either 1
to 1
forget 1
or 1
to 1
deem 1
it 1
unsafe 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
to 1
search 1
so 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
yet 1
convicted 1
of 1
the 1
intention 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
about 1
half 1
way 1
to 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
while 1
the 1
constables 1
having 1
us 1
in 1
charge 1
were 1
looking 1
ahead 1
henry 1
inquired 1
of 1
me 1
what 1
he 1
should 1
do 1
with 1
his 1
pass 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
biscuit 1
and 1
own 1
nothing 1
and 1
we 1
passed 1
the 1
word 1
around 1
_own 1
nothing 1
_ 1
and 1
_own 1
nothing 1
_ 1
said 1
we 1
all 1
our 1
confidence 1
in 1
each 1
other 1
was 1
unshaken 1
we 1
were 1
resolved 1
to 1
succeed 1
or 1
fail 1
together 1
after 1
the 1
calamity 1
had 1
befallen 1
us 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
before 1
we 1
were 1
now 1
prepared 1
for 1
any 1
thing 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
dragged 1
that 1
morning 1
fifteen 1
miles 1
behind 1
horses 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
be 1
placed 1
in 1
the 1
easton 1
jail 1
when 1
we 1
reached 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
we 1
underwent 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
examination 1
we 1
all 1
denied 1
that 1
we 1
ever 1
intended 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
we 1
did 1
this 1
more 1
to 1
bring 1
out 1
the 1
evidence 1
against 1
us 1
than 1
from 1
any 1
hope 1
of 1
getting 1
clear 1
of 1
being 1
sold 1
for 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
we 1
were 1
ready 1
for 1
that 1
the 1
fact 1
was 1
we 1
cared 1
but 1
little 1
where 1
we 1
went 1
so 1
we 1
went 1
together 1
our 1
greatest 1
concern 1
was 1
about 1
separation 1
we 1
dreaded 1
that 1
more 1
than 1
any 1
thing 1
this 1
side 1
of 1
death 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
evidence 1
against 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
testimony 1
of 1
one 1
person 1
our 1
master 1
would 1
not 1
tell 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
unanimous 1
decision 1
among 1
ourselves 1
as 1
to 1
who 1
their 1
informant 1
was 1
we 1
were 1
sent 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
jail 1
at 1
easton 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
there 1
we 1
were 1
delivered 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
sheriff 1
mr 1
joseph 1
graham 1
and 1
by 1
him 1
placed 1
in 1
jail 1
henry 1
john 1
and 1
myself 1
were 1
placed 1
in 1
one 1
room 1
together 1
charles 1
and 1
henry 1
bailey 1
in 1
another 1
their 1
object 1
in 1
separating 1
us 1
was 1
to 1
hinder 1
concert 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
jail 1
scarcely 1
twenty 1
minutes 1
when 1
a 1
swarm 1
of 1
slave 1
traders 1
and 1
agents 1
for 1
slave 1
traders 1
flocked 1
into 1
jail 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
us 1
and 1
to 1
ascertain 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
for 1
sale 1
such 1
a 1
set 1
of 1
beings 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
before 1
i 1
felt 1
myself 1
surrounded 1
by 1
so 1
many 1
fiends 1
from 1
perdition 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
pirates 1
never 1
looked 1
more 1
like 1
their 1
father 1
the 1
devil 1
they 1
laughed 1
and 1
grinned 1
over 1
us 1
saying 1
ah 1
my 1
boys 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
you 1
haven 1
t 1
we 1
and 1
after 1
taunting 1
us 1
in 1
various 1
ways 1
they 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
went 1
into 1
an 1
examination 1
of 1
us 1
with 1
intent 1
to 1
ascertain 1
our 1
value 1
they 1
would 1
impudently 1
ask 1
us 1
if 1
we 1
would 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
for 1
our 1
masters 1
we 1
would 1
make 1
them 1
no 1
answer 1
and 1
leave 1
them 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
as 1
best 1
they 1
could 1
then 1
they 1
would 1
curse 1
and 1
swear 1
at 1
us 1
telling 1
us 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
take 1
the 1
devil 1
out 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
little 1
while 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
only 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
while 1
in 1
jail 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
much 1
more 1
comfortable 1
quarters 1
than 1
we 1
expected 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
there 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
get 1
much 1
to 1
eat 1
nor 1
that 1
which 1
was 1
very 1
good 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
clean 1
room 1
from 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
which 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
which 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
better 1
than 1
though 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
dark 1
damp 1
cells 1
upon 1
the 1
whole 1
we 1
got 1
along 1
very 1
well 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
jail 1
and 1
its 1
keeper 1
were 1
concerned 1
immediately 1
after 1
the 1
holidays 1
were 1
over 1
contrary 1
to 1
all 1
our 1
expectations 1
mr 1
hamilton 1
and 1
mr 1
freeland 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
easton 1
and 1
took 1
charles 1
the 1
two 1
henrys 1
and 1
john 1
out 1
of 1
jail 1
and 1
carried 1
them 1
home 1
leaving 1
me 1
alone 1
i 1
regarded 1
this 1
separation 1
as 1
a 1
final 1
one 1
it 1
caused 1
me 1
more 1
pain 1
than 1
any 1
thing 1
else 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
transaction 1
i 1
was 1
ready 1
for 1
any 1
thing 1
rather 1
than 1
separation 1
i 1
supposed 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
consulted 1
together 1
and 1
had 1
decided 1
that 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
whole 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
innocent 1
suffer 1
with 1
the 1
guilty 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
therefore 1
concluded 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
others 1
home 1
and 1
sell 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
warning 1
to 1
the 1
others 1
that 1
remained 1
it 1
is 1
due 1
to 1
the 1
noble 1
henry 1
to 1
say 1
he 1
seemed 1
almost 1
as 1
reluctant 1
at 1
leaving 1
the 1
prison 1
as 1
at 1
leaving 1
home 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
prison 1
but 1
we 1
knew 1
we 1
should 1
in 1
all 1
probability 1
be 1
separated 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
sold 1
and 1
since 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
he 1
concluded 1
to 1
go 1
peaceably 1
home 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
left 1
to 1
my 1
fate 1
i 1
was 1
all 1
alone 1
and 1
within 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
a 1
stone 1
prison 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
before 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
hope 1
i 1
expected 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
safe 1
in 1
a 1
land 1
of 1
freedom 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
gloom 1
sunk 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
utmost 1
despair 1
i 1
thought 1
the 1
possibility 1
of 1
freedom 1
was 1
gone 1
i 1
was 1
kept 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
about 1
one 1
week 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
which 1
captain 1
auld 1
my 1
master 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
and 1
utter 1
astonishment 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
took 1
me 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
sending 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
gentleman 1
of 1
his 1
acquaintance 1
into 1
alabama 1
but 1
from 1
some 1
cause 1
or 1
other 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
send 1
me 1
to 1
alabama 1
but 1
concluded 1
to 1
send 1
me 1
back 1
to 1
baltimore 1
to 1
live 1
again 1
with 1
his 1
brother 1
hugh 1
and 1
to 1
learn 1
a 1
trade 1
thus 1
after 1
an 1
absence 1
of 1
three 1
years 1
and 1
one 1
month 1
i 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
permitted 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
old 1
home 1
at 1
baltimore 1
my 1
master 1
sent 1
me 1
away 1
because 1
there 1
existed 1
against 1
me 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
prejudice 1
in 1
the 1
community 1
and 1
he 1
feared 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
killed 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
weeks 1
after 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
baltimore 1
master 1
hugh 1
hired 1
me 1
to 1
mr 1
william 1
gardner 1
an 1
extensive 1
ship 1
builder 1
on 1
fell 1
s 1
point 1
i 1
was 1
put 1
there 1
to 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
calk 1
it 1
however 1
proved 1
a 1
very 1
unfavorable 1
place 1
for 1
the 1
accomplishment 1
of 1
this 1
object 1
mr 1
gardner 1
was 1
engaged 1
that 1
spring 1
in 1
building 1
two 1
large 1
man 1
of 1
war 1
brigs 1
professedly 1
for 1
the 1
mexican 1
government 1
the 1
vessels 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
launched 1
in 1
the 1
july 1
of 1
that 1
year 1
and 1
in 1
failure 1
thereof 1
mr 1
gardner 1
was 1
to 1
lose 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
entered 1
all 1
was 1
hurry 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
learn 1
any 1
thing 1
every 1
man 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
which 1
he 1
knew 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
entering 1
the 1
shipyard 1
my 1
orders 1
from 1
mr 1
gardner 1
were 1
to 1
do 1
whatever 1
the 1
carpenters 1
commanded 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
was 1
placing 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
beck 1
and 1
call 1
of 1
about 1
seventy 1
five 1

this 1
was 1
my 1
school 1
for 1
eight 1
months 1
and 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
remained 1
there 1
longer 1
but 1
for 1
a 1
most 1
horrid 1
fight 1
i 1
had 1
with 1
four 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
apprentices 1
in 1
which 1
my 1
left 1
eye 1
was 1
nearly 1
knocked 1
out 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
horribly 1
mangled 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
were 1
these 1
until 1
a 1
very 1
little 1
while 1
after 1
i 1
went 1
there 1
white 1
and 1
black 1
ship 1
carpenters 1
worked 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
seemed 1
to 1
see 1
any 1
impropriety 1
in 1
it 1
all 1
hands 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
well 1
satisfied 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
carpenters 1
were 1
freemen 1
things 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
going 1
on 1
very 1
well 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
white 1
carpenters 1
knocked 1
off 1
and 1
said 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
work 1
with 1
free 1
colored 1
workmen 1
their 1
reason 1
for 1
this 1
as 1
alleged 1
was 1
that 1
if 1
free 1
colored 1
carpenters 1
were 1
encouraged 1
they 1
would 1
soon 1
take 1
the 1
trade 1
into 1
their 1
own 1
hands 1
and 1
poor 1
white 1
men 1
would 1
be 1
thrown 1
out 1
of 1
employment 1
they 1
therefore 1
felt 1
called 1
upon 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
put 1
a 1
stop 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
taking 1
advantage 1
of 1
mr 1
gardner 1
s 1
necessities 1
they 1
broke 1
off 1
swearing 1
they 1
would 1
work 1
no 1
longer 1
unless 1
he 1
would 1
discharge 1
his 1
black 1
carpenters 1
now 1
though 1
this 1
did 1
not 1
extend 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
form 1
it 1
did 1
reach 1
me 1
in 1
fact 1
my 1
fellow 1
apprentices 1
very 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
it 1
degrading 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
me 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
airs 1
and 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
niggers 1
taking 1
the 1
country 1
saying 1
we 1
all 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
killed 1
and 1
being 1
encouraged 1
by 1
the 1
journeymen 1
they 1
commenced 1
making 1
my 1
condition 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
by 1
hectoring 1
me 1
around 1
and 1
sometimes 1
striking 1
me 1
i 1
of 1
course 1
kept 1
the 1
vow 1
i 1
made 1
after 1
the 1
fight 1
with 1
mr 1
covey 1
and 1
struck 1
back 1
again 1
regardless 1
of 1
consequences 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
kept 1
them 1
from 1
combining 1
i 1
succeeded 1
very 1
well 1
for 1
i 1
could 1
whip 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
them 1
taking 1
them 1
separately 1
they 1
however 1
at 1
length 1
combined 1
and 1
came 1
upon 1
me 1
armed 1
with 1
sticks 1
stones 1
and 1
heavy 1
handspikes 1
one 1
came 1
in 1
front 1
with 1
a 1
half 1
brick 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
at 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
one 1
behind 1
me 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
attending 1
to 1
those 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
the 1
one 1
behind 1
ran 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
handspike 1
and 1
struck 1
me 1
a 1
heavy 1
blow 1
upon 1
the 1
head 1
it 1
stunned 1
me 1
i 1
fell 1
and 1
with 1
this 1
they 1
all 1
ran 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
beating 1
me 1
with 1
their 1
fists 1
i 1
let 1
them 1
lay 1
on 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
gathering 1
strength 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
sudden 1
surge 1
and 1
rose 1
to 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
number 1
gave 1
me 1
with 1
his 1
heavy 1
boot 1
a 1
powerful 1
kick 1
in 1
the 1
left 1
eye 1
my 1
eyeball 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
burst 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
my 1
eye 1
closed 1
and 1
badly 1
swollen 1
they 1
left 1
me 1
with 1
this 1
i 1
seized 1
the 1
handspike 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
pursued 1
them 1
but 1
here 1
the 1
carpenters 1
interfered 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
stand 1
my 1
hand 1
against 1
so 1
many 1
all 1
this 1
took 1
place 1
in 1
sight 1
of 1
not 1
less 1
than 1
fifty 1
white 1
ship 1
carpenters 1
and 1
not 1
one 1
interposed 1
a 1
friendly 1
word 1
but 1
some 1
cried 1
kill 1
the 1
damned 1
nigger 1
kill 1
him 1
kill 1
him 1
he 1
struck 1
a 1
white 1
person 1
i 1
found 1
my 1
only 1
chance 1
for 1
life 1
was 1
in 1
flight 1
i 1
succeeded 1
in 1
getting 1
away 1
without 1
an 1
additional 1
blow 1
and 1
barely 1
so 1
for 1
to 1
strike 1
a 1
white 1
man 1
is 1
death 1
by 1
lynch 1
law 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
law 1
in 1
mr 1
gardner 1
s 1
ship 1
yard 1
nor 1
is 1
there 1
much 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
out 1
of 1
mr 1
gardner 1
s 1
ship 1
yard 1
i 1
went 1
directly 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
my 1
wrongs 1
to 1
master 1
hugh 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
happy 1
to 1
say 1
of 1
him 1
irreligious 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
his 1
conduct 1
was 1
heavenly 1
compared 1
with 1
that 1
of 1
his 1
brother 1
thomas 1
under 1
similar 1
circumstances 1
he 1
listened 1
attentively 1
to 1
my 1
narration 1
of 1
the 1
circumstances 1
leading 1
to 1
the 1
savage 1
outrage 1
and 1
gave 1
many 1
proofs 1
of 1
his 1
strong 1
indignation 1
at 1
it 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
my 1
once 1
overkind 1
mistress 1
was 1
again 1
melted 1
into 1
pity 1
my 1
puffed 1
out 1
eye 1
and 1
blood 1
covered 1
face 1
moved 1
her 1
to 1
tears 1
she 1
took 1
a 1
chair 1
by 1
me 1
washed 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
mother 1
s 1
tenderness 1
bound 1
up 1
my 1
head 1
covering 1
the 1
wounded 1
eye 1
with 1
a 1
lean 1
piece 1
of 1
fresh 1
beef 1
it 1
was 1
almost 1
compensation 1
for 1
my 1
suffering 1
to 1
witness 1
once 1
more 1
a 1
manifestation 1
of 1
kindness 1
from 1
this 1
my 1
once 1
affectionate 1
old 1
mistress 1
master 1
hugh 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
enraged 1
he 1
gave 1
expression 1
to 1
his 1
feelings 1
by 1
pouring 1
out 1
curses 1
upon 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
did 1
the 1
deed 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
the 1
better 1
of 1
my 1
bruises 1
he 1
took 1
me 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
esquire 1
watson 1
s 1
on 1
bond 1
street 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
could 1
be 1
done 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
mr 1
watson 1
inquired 1
who 1
saw 1
the 1
assault 1
committed 1
master 1
hugh 1
told 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
done 1
in 1
mr 1
gardner 1
s 1
ship 1
yard 1
at 1
midday 1
where 1
there 1
were 1
a 1
large 1
company 1
of 1
men 1
at 1
work 1
as 1
to 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
deed 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
question 1
as 1
to 1
who 1
did 1
it 1
his 1
answer 1
was 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
unless 1
some 1
white 1
man 1
would 1
come 1
forward 1
and 1
testify 1
he 1
could 1
issue 1
no 1
warrant 1
on 1
my 1
word 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
killed 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
colored 1
people 1
their 1
testimony 1
combined 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
insufficient 1
to 1
have 1
arrested 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
murderers 1
master 1
hugh 1
for 1
once 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
say 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
was 1
too 1
bad 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
get 1
any 1
white 1
man 1
to 1
volunteer 1
his 1
testimony 1
in 1
my 1
behalf 1
and 1
against 1
the 1
white 1
young 1
men 1
even 1
those 1
who 1
may 1
have 1
sympathized 1
with 1
me 1
were 1
not 1
prepared 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
it 1
required 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
courage 1
unknown 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
for 1
just 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
the 1
slightest 1
manifestation 1
of 1
humanity 1
toward 1
a 1
colored 1
person 1
was 1
denounced 1
as 1
abolitionism 1
and 1
that 1
name 1
subjected 1
its 1
bearer 1
to 1
frightful 1
liabilities 1
the 1
watchwords 1
of 1
the 1
bloody 1
minded 1
in 1
that 1
region 1
and 1
in 1
those 1
days 1
were 1
damn 1
the 1
abolitionists 1
and 1
damn 1
the 1
niggers 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
done 1
and 1
probably 1
nothing 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
done 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
killed 1
such 1
was 1
and 1
such 1
remains 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
in 1
the 1
christian 1
city 1
of 1
baltimore 1
master 1
hugh 1
finding 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
no 1
redress 1
refused 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
back 1
again 1
to 1
mr 1
gardner 1
he 1
kept 1
me 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
dressed 1
my 1
wound 1
till 1
i 1
was 1
again 1
restored 1
to 1
health 1
he 1
then 1
took 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
ship 1
yard 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
foreman 1
in 1
the 1
employment 1
of 1
mr 1
walter 1
price 1
there 1
i 1
was 1
immediately 1
set 1
to 1
calking 1
and 1
very 1
soon 1
learned 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
using 1
my 1
mallet 1
and 1
irons 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
one 1
year 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
left 1
mr 1
gardner 1
s 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
command 1
the 1
highest 1
wages 1
given 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
experienced 1
calkers 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
of 1
some 1
importance 1
to 1
my 1
master 1
i 1
was 1
bringing 1
him 1
from 1
six 1
to 1
seven 1
dollars 1
per 1
week 1
i 1
sometimes 1
brought 1
him 1
nine 1
dollars 1
per 1
week 1
my 1
wages 1
were 1
a 1
dollar 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
a 1
day 1
after 1
learning 1
how 1
to 1
calk 1
i 1
sought 1
my 1
own 1
employment 1
made 1
my 1
own 1
contracts 1
and 1
collected 1
the 1
money 1
which 1
i 1
earned 1
my 1
pathway 1
became 1
much 1
more 1
smooth 1
than 1
before 1
my 1
condition 1
was 1
now 1
much 1
more 1
comfortable 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
no 1
calking 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
did 1
nothing 1
during 1
these 1
leisure 1
times 1
those 1
old 1
notions 1
about 1
freedom 1
would 1
steal 1
over 1
me 1
again 1
when 1
in 1
mr 1
gardner 1
s 1
employment 1
i 1
was 1
kept 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
perpetual 1
whirl 1
of 1
excitement 1
i 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
scarcely 1
but 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
in 1
thinking 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
almost 1
forgot 1
my 1
liberty 1
i 1
have 1
observed 1
this 1
in 1
my 1
experience 1
of 1
slavery 1
that 1
whenever 1
my 1
condition 1
was 1
improved 1
instead 1
of 1
its 1
increasing 1
my 1
contentment 1
it 1
only 1
increased 1
my 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
free 1
and 1
set 1
me 1
to 1
thinking 1
of 1
plans 1
to 1
gain 1
my 1
freedom 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
that 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
contented 1
slave 1
it 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
thoughtless 1
one 1
it 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
darken 1
his 1
moral 1
and 1
mental 1
vision 1
and 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
annihilate 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
reason 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
detect 1
no 1
inconsistencies 1
in 1
slavery 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
made 1
to 1
feel 1
that 1
slavery 1
is 1
right 1
and 1
he 1
can 1
be 1
brought 1
to 1
that 1
only 1
when 1
he 1
ceases 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
getting 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
one 1
dollar 1
and 1
fifty 1
cents 1
per 1
day 1
i 1
contracted 1
for 1
it 1
i 1
earned 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
paid 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
rightfully 1
my 1
own 1
yet 1
upon 1
each 1
returning 1
saturday 1
night 1
i 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
deliver 1
every 1
cent 1
of 1
that 1
money 1
to 1
master 1
hugh 1
and 1
why 1
not 1
because 1
he 1
earned 1
it 1
not 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
any 1
hand 1
in 1
earning 1
it 1
not 1
because 1
i 1
owed 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
nor 1
because 1
he 1
possessed 1
the 1
slightest 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
it 1
but 1
solely 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
compel 1
me 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
the 1
grim 1
visaged 1
pirate 1
upon 1
the 1
high 1
seas 1
is 1
exactly 1
the 1
same 1
chapter 1
xi 1
i 1
now 1
come 1
to 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
planned 1
and 1
finally 1
succeeded 1
in 1
making 1
my 1
escape 1
from 1
slavery 1
but 1
before 1
narrating 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
peculiar 1
circumstances 1
i 1
deem 1
it 1
proper 1
to 1
make 1
known 1
my 1
intention 1
not 1
to 1
state 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
transaction 1
my 1
reasons 1
for 1
pursuing 1
this 1
course 1
may 1
be 1
understood 1
from 1
the 1
following 1
first 1
were 1
i 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
minute 1
statement 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
only 1
possible 1
but 1
quite 1
probable 1
that 1
others 1
would 1
thereby 1
be 1
involved 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
embarrassing 1
difficulties 1
secondly 1
such 1
a 1
statement 1
would 1
most 1
undoubtedly 1
induce 1
greater 1
vigilance 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
slaveholders 1
than 1
has 1
existed 1
heretofore 1
among 1
them 1
which 1
would 1
of 1
course 1
be 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
guarding 1
a 1
door 1
whereby 1
some 1
dear 1
brother 1
bondman 1
might 1
escape 1
his 1
galling 1
chains 1
i 1
deeply 1
regret 1
the 1
necessity 1
that 1
impels 1
me 1
to 1
suppress 1
any 1
thing 1
of 1
importance 1
connected 1
with 1
my 1
experience 1
in 1
slavery 1
it 1
would 1
afford 1
me 1
great 1
pleasure 1
indeed 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
materially 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
my 1
narrative 1
were 1
i 1
at 1
liberty 1
to 1
gratify 1
a 1
curiosity 1
which 1
i 1
know 1
exists 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
many 1
by 1
an 1
accurate 1
statement 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
pertaining 1
to 1
my 1
most 1
fortunate 1
escape 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
deprive 1
myself 1
of 1
this 1
pleasure 1
and 1
the 1
curious 1
of 1
the 1
gratification 1
which 1
such 1
a 1
statement 1
would 1
afford 1
i 1
would 1
allow 1
myself 1
to 1
suffer 1
under 1
the 1
greatest 1
imputations 1
which 1
evil 1
minded 1
men 1
might 1
suggest 1
rather 1
than 1
exculpate 1
myself 1
and 1
thereby 1
run 1
the 1
hazard 1
of 1
closing 1
the 1
slightest 1
avenue 1
by 1
which 1
a 1
brother 1
slave 1
might 1
clear 1
himself 1
of 1
the 1
chains 1
and 1
fetters 1
of 1
slavery 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
approved 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
public 1
manner 1
in 1
which 1
some 1
of 1
our 1
western 1
friends 1
have 1
conducted 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
the 1
_underground 1
railroad 1
_ 1
but 1
which 1
i 1
think 1
by 1
their 1
open 1
declarations 1
has 1
been 1
made 1
most 1
emphatically 1
the 1
_upper 1
ground 1
railroad 1
_ 1
i 1
honor 1
those 1
good 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
for 1
their 1
noble 1
daring 1
and 1
applaud 1
them 1
for 1
willingly 1
subjecting 1
themselves 1
to 1
bloody 1
persecution 1
by 1
openly 1
avowing 1
their 1
participation 1
in 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
slaves 1
i 1
however 1
can 1
see 1
very 1
little 1
good 1
resulting 1
from 1
such 1
a 1
course 1
either 1
to 1
themselves 1
or 1
the 1
slaves 1
escaping 1
while 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
i 1
see 1
and 1
feel 1
assured 1
that 1
those 1
open 1
declarations 1
are 1
a 1
positive 1
evil 1
to 1
the 1
slaves 1
remaining 1
who 1
are 1
seeking 1
to 1
escape 1
they 1
do 1
nothing 1
towards 1
enlightening 1
the 1
slave 1
whilst 1
they 1
do 1
much 1
towards 1
enlightening 1
the 1
master 1
they 1
stimulate 1
him 1
to 1
greater 1
watchfulness 1
and 1
enhance 1
his 1
power 1
to 1
capture 1
his 1
slave 1
we 1
owe 1
something 1
to 1
the 1
slave 1
south 1
of 1
the 1
line 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
to 1
those 1
north 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
aiding 1
the 1
latter 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
freedom 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
careful 1
to 1
do 1
nothing 1
which 1
would 1
be 1
likely 1
to 1
hinder 1
the 1
former 1
from 1
escaping 1
from 1
slavery 1
i 1
would 1
keep 1
the 1
merciless 1
slaveholder 1
profoundly 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
flight 1
adopted 1
by 1
the 1
slave 1
i 1
would 1
leave 1
him 1
to 1
imagine 1
himself 1
surrounded 1
by 1
myriads 1
of 1
invisible 1
tormentors 1
ever 1
ready 1
to 1
snatch 1
from 1
his 1
infernal 1
grasp 1
his 1
trembling 1
prey 1
let 1
him 1
be 1
left 1
to 1
feel 1
his 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
let 1
darkness 1
commensurate 1
with 1
his 1
crime 1
hover 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
feel 1
that 1
at 1
every 1
step 1
he 1
takes 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
the 1
flying 1
bondman 1
he 1
is 1
running 1
the 1
frightful 1
risk 1
of 1
having 1
his 1
hot 1
brains 1
dashed 1
out 1
by 1
an 1
invisible 1
agency 1
let 1
us 1
render 1
the 1
tyrant 1
no 1
aid 1
let 1
us 1
not 1
hold 1
the 1
light 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
can 1
trace 1
the 1
footprints 1
of 1
our 1
flying 1
brother 1
but 1
enough 1
of 1
this 1
i 1
will 1
now 1
proceed 1
to 1
the 1
statement 1
of 1
those 1
facts 1
connected 1
with 1
my 1
escape 1
for 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
alone 1
responsible 1
and 1
for 1
which 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
be 1
made 1
to 1
suffer 1
but 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
year 1
1838 1
i 1
became 1
quite 1
restless 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
each 1
week 1
pour 1
the 1
reward 1
of 1
my 1
toil 1
into 1
the 1
purse 1
of 1
my 1
master 1
when 1
i 1
carried 1
to 1
him 1
my 1
weekly 1
wages 1
he 1
would 1
after 1
counting 1
the 1
money 1
look 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
robber 1
like 1
fierceness 1
and 1
ask 1
is 1
this 1
all 1
he 1
was 1
satisfied 1
with 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
last 1
cent 1
he 1
would 1
however 1
when 1
i 1
made 1
him 1
six 1
dollars 1
sometimes 1
give 1
me 1
six 1
cents 1
to 1
encourage 1
me 1
it 1
had 1
the 1
opposite 1
effect 1
i 1
regarded 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
admission 1
of 1
my 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
any 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
wages 1
was 1
proof 1
to 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
he 1
believed 1
me 1
entitled 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
them 1
i 1
always 1
felt 1
worse 1
for 1
having 1
received 1
any 1
thing 1
for 1
i 1
feared 1
that 1
the 1
giving 1
me 1
a 1
few 1
cents 1
would 1
ease 1
his 1
conscience 1
and 1
make 1
him 1
feel 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
pretty 1
honorable 1
sort 1
of 1
robber 1
my 1
discontent 1
grew 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
ever 1
on 1
the 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
means 1
of 1
escape 1
and 1
finding 1
no 1
direct 1
means 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
hire 1
my 1
time 1
with 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
getting 1
money 1
with 1
which 1
to 1
make 1
my 1
escape 1
in 1
the 1
spring 1
of 1
1838 1
when 1
master 1
thomas 1
came 1
to 1
baltimore 1
to 1
purchase 1
his 1
spring 1
goods 1
i 1
got 1
an 1
opportunity 1
and 1
applied 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
hire 1
my 1
time 1
he 1
unhesitatingly 1
refused 1
my 1
request 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
this 1
was 1
another 1
stratagem 1
by 1
which 1
to 1
escape 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
i 1
could 1
go 1
nowhere 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
me 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
event 1
of 1
my 1
running 1
away 1
he 1
should 1
spare 1
no 1
pains 1
in 1
his 1
efforts 1
to 1
catch 1
me 1
he 1
exhorted 1
me 1
to 1
content 1
myself 1
and 1
be 1
obedient 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
would 1
be 1
happy 1
i 1
must 1
lay 1
out 1
no 1
plans 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
i 1
behaved 1
myself 1
properly 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
me 1
indeed 1
he 1
advised 1
me 1
to 1
complete 1
thoughtlessness 1
of 1
the 1
future 1
and 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
depend 1
solely 1
upon 1
him 1
for 1
happiness 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
see 1
fully 1
the 1
pressing 1
necessity 1
of 1
setting 1
aside 1
my 1
intellectual 1
nature 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
contentment 1
in 1
slavery 1
but 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
even 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
myself 1
i 1
continued 1
to 1
think 1
and 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
injustice 1
of 1
my 1
enslavement 1
and 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
escape 1
about 1
two 1
months 1
after 1
this 1
i 1
applied 1
to 1
master 1
hugh 1
for 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
hiring 1
my 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
applied 1
to 1
master 1
thomas 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
refused 1
he 1
too 1
at 1
first 1
seemed 1
disposed 1
to 1
refuse 1
but 1
after 1
some 1
reflection 1
he 1
granted 1
me 1
the 1
privilege 1
and 1
proposed 1
the 1
following 1
terms 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
all 1
my 1
time 1
make 1
all 1
contracts 1
with 1
those 1
for 1
whom 1
i 1
worked 1
and 1
find 1
my 1
own 1
employment 1
and 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
this 1
liberty 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
pay 1
him 1
three 1
dollars 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
each 1
week 1
find 1
myself 1
in 1
calking 1
tools 1
and 1
in 1
board 1
and 1
clothing 1
my 1
board 1
was 1
two 1
dollars 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
per 1
week 1
this 1
with 1
the 1
wear 1
and 1
tear 1
of 1
clothing 1
and 1
calking 1
tools 1
made 1
my 1
regular 1
expenses 1
about 1
six 1
dollars 1
per 1
week 1
this 1
amount 1
i 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
or 1
relinquish 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
hiring 1
my 1
time 1
rain 1
or 1
shine 1
work 1
or 1
no 1
work 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
each 1
week 1
the 1
money 1
must 1
be 1
forthcoming 1
or 1
i 1
must 1
give 1
up 1
my 1
privilege 1
this 1
arrangement 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
perceived 1
was 1
decidedly 1
in 1
my 1
master 1
s 1
favor 1
it 1
relieved 1
him 1
of 1
all 1
need 1
of 1
looking 1
after 1
me 1
his 1
money 1
was 1
sure 1
he 1
received 1
all 1
the 1
benefits 1
of 1
slaveholding 1
without 1
its 1
evils 1
while 1
i 1
endured 1
all 1
the 1
evils 1
of 1
a 1
slave 1
and 1
suffered 1
all 1
the 1
care 1
and 1
anxiety 1
of 1
a 1
freeman 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
a 1
hard 1
bargain 1
but 1
hard 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
old 1
mode 1
of 1
getting 1
along 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
step 1
towards 1
freedom 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
responsibilities 1
of 1
a 1
freeman 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
upon 1
it 1
i 1
bent 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
making 1
money 1
i 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
work 1
at 1
night 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
day 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
untiring 1
perseverance 1
and 1
industry 1
i 1
made 1
enough 1
to 1
meet 1
my 1
expenses 1
and 1
lay 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
money 1
every 1
week 1
i 1
went 1
on 1
thus 1
from 1
may 1
till 1
august 1
master 1
hugh 1
then 1
refused 1
to 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
hire 1
my 1
time 1
longer 1
the 1
ground 1
for 1
his 1
refusal 1
was 1
a 1
failure 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
one 1
saturday 1
night 1
to 1
pay 1
him 1
for 1
my 1
week 1
s 1
time 1
this 1
failure 1
was 1
occasioned 1
by 1
my 1
attending 1
a 1
camp 1
meeting 1
about 1
ten 1
miles 1
from 1
baltimore 1
during 1
the 1
week 1
i 1
had 1
entered 1
into 1
an 1
engagement 1
with 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
young 1
friends 1
to 1
start 1
from 1
baltimore 1
to 1
the 1
camp 1
ground 1
early 1
saturday 1
evening 1
and 1
being 1
detained 1
by 1
my 1
employer 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
get 1
down 1
to 1
master 1
hugh 1
s 1
without 1
disappointing 1
the 1
company 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
master 1
hugh 1
was 1
in 1
no 1
special 1
need 1
of 1
the 1
money 1
that 1
night 1
i 1
therefore 1
decided 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
camp 1
meeting 1
and 1
upon 1
my 1
return 1
pay 1
him 1
the 1
three 1
dollars 1
i 1
staid 1
at 1
the 1
camp 1
meeting 1
one 1
day 1
longer 1
than 1
i 1
intended 1
when 1
i 1
left 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
returned 1
i 1
called 1
upon 1
him 1
to 1
pay 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
considered 1
his 1
due 1
i 1
found 1
him 1
very 1
angry 1
he 1
could 1
scarce 1
restrain 1
his 1
wrath 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
mind 1
to 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
severe 1
whipping 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
know 1
how 1
i 1
dared 1
go 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
without 1
asking 1
his 1
permission 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
hired 1
my 1
time 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
paid 1
him 1
the 1
price 1
which 1
he 1
asked 1
for 1
it 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
bound 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
when 1
and 1
where 1
i 1
should 1
go 1
this 1
reply 1
troubled 1
him 1
and 1
after 1
reflecting 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
should 1
hire 1
my 1
time 1
no 1
longer 1
that 1
the 1
next 1
thing 1
he 1
should 1
know 1
of 1
i 1
would 1
be 1
running 1
away 1
upon 1
the 1
same 1
plea 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
to 1
bring 1
my 1
tools 1
and 1
clothing 1
home 1
forthwith 1
i 1
did 1
so 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
seeking 1
work 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
to 1
do 1
previously 1
to 1
hiring 1
my 1
time 1
i 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
week 1
without 1
the 1
performance 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
stroke 1
of 1
work 1
i 1
did 1
this 1
in 1
retaliation 1
saturday 1
night 1
he 1
called 1
upon 1
me 1
as 1
usual 1
for 1
my 1
week 1
s 1
wages 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
wages 1
i 1
had 1
done 1
no 1
work 1
that 1
week 1
here 1
we 1
were 1
upon 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
coming 1
to 1
blows 1
he 1
raved 1
and 1
swore 1
his 1
determination 1
to 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
allow 1
myself 1
a 1
single 1
word 1
but 1
was 1
resolved 1
if 1
he 1
laid 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
me 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
blow 1
for 1
blow 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
strike 1
me 1
but 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
find 1
me 1
in 1
constant 1
employment 1
in 1
future 1
i 1
thought 1
the 1
matter 1
over 1
during 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
sunday 1
and 1
finally 1
resolved 1
upon 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
of 1
september 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
upon 1
which 1
i 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
second 1
attempt 1
to 1
secure 1
my 1
freedom 1
i 1
now 1
had 1
three 1
weeks 1
during 1
which 1
to 1
prepare 1
for 1
my 1
journey 1
early 1
on 1
monday 1
morning 1
before 1
master 1
hugh 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
engagement 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
went 1
out 1
and 1
got 1
employment 1
of 1
mr 1
butler 1
at 1
his 1
ship 1
yard 1
near 1
the 1
drawbridge 1
upon 1
what 1
is 1
called 1
the 1
city 1
block 1
thus 1
making 1
it 1
unnecessary 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
seek 1
employment 1
for 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
week 1
i 1
brought 1
him 1
between 1
eight 1
and 1
nine 1
dollars 1
he 1
seemed 1
very 1
well 1
pleased 1
and 1
asked 1
why 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
the 1
week 1
before 1
he 1
little 1
knew 1
what 1
my 1
plans 1
were 1
my 1
object 1
in 1
working 1
steadily 1
was 1
to 1
remove 1
any 1
suspicion 1
he 1
might 1
entertain 1
of 1
my 1
intent 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
i 1
succeeded 1
admirably 1
i 1
suppose 1
he 1
thought 1
i 1
was 1
never 1
better 1
satisfied 1
with 1
my 1
condition 1
than 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
time 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
planning 1
my 1
escape 1
the 1
second 1
week 1
passed 1
and 1
again 1
i 1
carried 1
him 1
my 1
full 1
wages 1
and 1
so 1
well 1
pleased 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
twenty 1
five 1
cents 1
quite 1
a 1
large 1
sum 1
for 1
a 1
slaveholder 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
slave 1
and 1
bade 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
good 1
use 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
would 1
things 1
went 1
on 1
without 1
very 1
smoothly 1
indeed 1
but 1
within 1
there 1
was 1
trouble 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
describe 1
my 1
feelings 1
as 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
my 1
contemplated 1
start 1
drew 1
near 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
warmhearted 1
friends 1
in 1
baltimore 1
friends 1
that 1
i 1
loved 1
almost 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
being 1
separated 1
from 1
them 1
forever 1
was 1
painful 1
beyond 1
expression 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
opinion 1
that 1
thousands 1
would 1
escape 1
from 1
slavery 1
who 1
now 1
remain 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
strong 1
cords 1
of 1
affection 1
that 1
bind 1
them 1
to 1
their 1
friends 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
leaving 1
my 1
friends 1
was 1
decidedly 1
the 1
most 1
painful 1
thought 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
contend 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
my 1
tender 1
point 1
and 1
shook 1
my 1
decision 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
things 1
else 1
besides 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
separation 1
the 1
dread 1
and 1
apprehension 1
of 1
a 1
failure 1
exceeded 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
experienced 1
at 1
my 1
first 1
attempt 1
the 1
appalling 1
defeat 1
i 1
then 1
sustained 1
returned 1
to 1
torment 1
me 1
i 1
felt 1
assured 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
failed 1
in 1
this 1
attempt 1
my 1
case 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
hopeless 1
one 1
it 1
would 1
seal 1
my 1
fate 1
as 1
a 1
slave 1
forever 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
hope 1
to 1
get 1
off 1
with 1
any 1
thing 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
severest 1
punishment 1
and 1
being 1
placed 1
beyond 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
escape 1
it 1
required 1
no 1
very 1
vivid 1
imagination 1
to 1
depict 1
the 1
most 1
frightful 1
scenes 1
through 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
pass 1
in 1
case 1
i 1
failed 1
the 1
wretchedness 1
of 1
slavery 1
and 1
the 1
blessedness 1
of 1
freedom 1
were 1
perpetually 1
before 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
remained 1
firm 1
and 1
according 1
to 1
my 1
resolution 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
of 1
september 1
1838 1
i 1
left 1
my 1
chains 1
and 1
succeeded 1
in 1
reaching 1
new 1
york 1
without 1
the 1
slightest 1
interruption 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
how 1
i 1
did 1
so 1
what 1
means 1
i 1
adopted 1
what 1
direction 1
i 1
travelled 1
and 1
by 1
what 1
mode 1
of 1
conveyance 1
i 1
must 1
leave 1
unexplained 1
for 1
the 1
reasons 1
before 1
mentioned 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
frequently 1
asked 1
how 1
i 1
felt 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
free 1
state 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
answer 1
the 1
question 1
with 1
any 1
satisfaction 1
to 1
myself 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
excitement 1
i 1
ever 1
experienced 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
one 1
may 1
imagine 1
the 1
unarmed 1
mariner 1
to 1
feel 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
rescued 1
by 1
a 1
friendly 1
man 1
of 1
war 1
from 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
a 1
pirate 1
in 1
writing 1
to 1
a 1
dear 1
friend 1
immediately 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
at 1
new 1
york 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
felt 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
escaped 1
a 1
den 1
of 1
hungry 1
lions 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
however 1
very 1
soon 1
subsided 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
again 1
seized 1
with 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
great 1
insecurity 1
and 1
loneliness 1
i 1
was 1
yet 1
liable 1
to 1
be 1
taken 1
back 1
and 1
subjected 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
slavery 1
this 1
in 1
itself 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
damp 1
the 1
ardor 1
of 1
my 1
enthusiasm 1
but 1
the 1
loneliness 1
overcame 1
me 1
there 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
thousands 1
and 1
yet 1
a 1
perfect 1
stranger 1
without 1
home 1
and 1
without 1
friends 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
brethren 1
children 1
of 1
a 1
common 1
father 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
to 1
unfold 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
my 1
sad 1
condition 1
i 1
was 1
afraid 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
for 1
fear 1
of 1
speaking 1
to 1
the 1
wrong 1
one 1
and 1
thereby 1
falling 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
money 1
loving 1
kidnappers 1
whose 1
business 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
panting 1
fugitive 1
as 1
the 1
ferocious 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
lie 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
their 1
prey 1
the 1
motto 1
which 1
i 1
adopted 1
when 1
i 1
started 1
from 1
slavery 1
was 1
this 1
trust 1
no 1
man 1
i 1
saw 1
in 1
every 1
white 1
man 1
an 1
enemy 1
and 1
in 1
almost 1
every 1
colored 1
man 1
cause 1
for 1
distrust 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
painful 1
situation 1
and 1
to 1
understand 1
it 1
one 1
must 1
needs 1
experience 1
it 1
or 1
imagine 1
himself 1
in 1
similar 1
circumstances 1
let 1
him 1
be 1
a 1
fugitive 1
slave 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
land 1
a 1
land 1
given 1
up 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
hunting 1
ground 1
for 1
slaveholders 1
whose 1
inhabitants 1
are 1
legalized 1
kidnappers 1
where 1
he 1
is 1
every 1
moment 1
subjected 1
to 1
the 1
terrible 1
liability 1
of 1
being 1
seized 1
upon 1
by 1
his 1
fellowmen 1
as 1
the 1
hideous 1
crocodile 1
seizes 1
upon 1
his 1
prey 1
i 1
say 1
let 1
him 1
place 1
himself 1
in 1
my 1
situation 1
without 1
home 1
or 1
friends 1
without 1
money 1
or 1
credit 1
wanting 1
shelter 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
wanting 1
bread 1
and 1
no 1
money 1
to 1
buy 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
let 1
him 1
feel 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
pursued 1
by 1
merciless 1
men 1
hunters 1
and 1
in 1
total 1
darkness 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
where 1
to 1
go 1
or 1
where 1
to 1
stay 1
perfectly 1
helpless 1
both 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
defence 1
and 1
means 1
of 1
escape 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
plenty 1
yet 1
suffering 1
the 1
terrible 1
gnawings 1
of 1
hunger 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
houses 1
yet 1
having 1
no 1
home 1
among 1
fellow 1
men 1
yet 1
feeling 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
wild 1
beasts 1
whose 1
greediness 1
to 1
swallow 1
up 1
the 1
trembling 1
and 1
half 1
famished 1
fugitive 1
is 1
only 1
equalled 1
by 1
that 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
monsters 1
of 1
the 1
deep 1
swallow 1
up 1
the 1
helpless 1
fish 1
upon 1
which 1
they 1
subsist 1
i 1
say 1
let 1
him 1
be 1
placed 1
in 1
this 1
most 1
trying 1
situation 1
the 1
situation 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
placed 1
then 1
and 1
not 1
till 1
then 1
will 1
he 1
fully 1
appreciate 1
the 1
hardships 1
of 1
and 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
sympathize 1
with 1
the 1
toil 1
worn 1
and 1
whip 1
scarred 1
fugitive 1
slave 1
thank 1
heaven 1
i 1
remained 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
in 1
this 1
distressed 1
situation 1
i 1
was 1
relieved 1
from 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
humane 1
hand 1
of 1
mr 1
david 1
ruggles 1
whose 1
vigilance 1
kindness 1
and 1
perseverance 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
of 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
express 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
words 1
can 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
gratitude 1
i 1
bear 1
him 1
mr 1
ruggles 1
is 1
now 1
afflicted 1
with 1
blindness 1
and 1
is 1
himself 1
in 1
need 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
kind 1
offices 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
once 1
so 1
forward 1
in 1
the 1
performance 1
of 1
toward 1
others 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
new 1
york 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
when 1
mr 1
ruggles 1
sought 1
me 1
out 1
and 1
very 1
kindly 1
took 1
me 1
to 1
his 1
boarding 1
house 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
church 1
and 1
lespenard 1
streets 1
mr 1
ruggles 1
was 1
then 1
very 1
deeply 1
engaged 1
in 1
the 1
memorable 1
_darg_ 1
case 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
attending 1
to 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
other 1
fugitive 1
slaves 1
devising 1
ways 1
and 1
means 1
for 1
their 1
successful 1
escape 1
and 1
though 1
watched 1
and 1
hemmed 1
in 1
on 1
almost 1
every 1
side 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
match 1
for 1
his 1
enemies 1
very 1
soon 1
after 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
mr 1
ruggles 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
know 1
of 1
me 1
where 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
go 1
as 1
he 1
deemed 1
it 1
unsafe 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
new 1
york 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
calker 1
and 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
work 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
going 1
to 1
canada 1
but 1
he 1
decided 1
against 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
favor 1
of 1
my 1
going 1
to 1
new 1
bedford 1
thinking 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
work 1
there 1
at 1
my 1
trade 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
anna 1
my 1
intended 1
wife 1
came 1
on 1
for 1

wrote 1
to 1
her 1
immediately 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
at 1

notwithstanding 1
my 1
homeless 1
houseless 1
and 1
helpless 1
condition 1
informing 1
her 1
of 1
my 1
successful 1
flight 1
and 1
wishing 1
her 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
forthwith 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
after 1
her 1
arrival 1
mr 1

called 1

and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
others 1
performed 1
the 1

ceremony 1
and 1
gave 1
us 1
a 1
certificate 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
following 1
is 1
an 1
exact 1

was 1
free 1

had 1
changed 1
my 1
name 1
from 1
frederick 1
bailey 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
johnson 1
upon 1
receiving 1
this 1
certificate 1
and 1
a 1
five 1
dollar 1
bill 1
from 1
mr 1
ruggles 1
i 1
shouldered 1
one 1
part 1
of 1
our 1
baggage 1
and 1
anna 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
we 1
set 1
out 1
forthwith 1
to 1
take 1
passage 1
on 1
board 1
of 1
the 1
steamboat 1
john 1
w 1
richmond 1
for 1
newport 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
to 1
new 1
bedford 1
mr 1
ruggles 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
letter 1
to 1
a 1
mr 1
shaw 1
in 1
newport 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
in 1
case 1
my 1
money 1
did 1
not 1
serve 1
me 1
to 1
new 1
bedford 1
to 1
stop 1
in 1
newport 1
and 1
obtain 1
further 1
assistance 1
but 1
upon 1
our 1
arrival 1
at 1
newport 1
we 1
were 1
so 1
anxious 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
safety 1
that 1
notwithstanding 1
we 1
lacked 1
the 1
necessary 1
money 1
to 1
pay 1
our 1
fare 1
we 1
decided 1
to 1
take 1
seats 1
in 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
promise 1
to 1
pay 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
new 1
bedford 1
we 1
were 1
encouraged 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
by 1
two 1
excellent 1
gentlemen 1
residents 1
of 1
new 1
bedford 1
whose 1
names 1
i 1
afterward 1
ascertained 1
to 1
be 1
joseph 1
ricketson 1
and 1
william 1
c 1
taber 1
they 1
seemed 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
understand 1
our 1
circumstances 1
and 1
gave 1
us 1
such 1
assurance 1
of 1
their 1
friendliness 1
as 1
put 1
us 1
fully 1
at 1
ease 1
in 1
their 1
presence 1
it 1
was 1
good 1
indeed 1
to 1
meet 1
with 1
such 1
friends 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
time 1
upon 1
reaching 1
new 1
bedford 1
we 1
were 1
directed 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mr 1
nathan 1
johnson 1
by 1
whom 1
we 1
were 1
kindly 1
received 1
and 1
hospitably 1
provided 1
for 1
both 1
mr 1
and 1
mrs 1
johnson 1
took 1
a 1
deep 1
and 1
lively 1
interest 1
in 1
our 1
welfare 1
they 1
proved 1
themselves 1
quite 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
abolitionists 1
when 1
the 1
stage 1
driver 1
found 1
us 1
unable 1
to 1
pay 1
our 1
fare 1
he 1
held 1
on 1
upon 1
our 1
baggage 1
as 1
security 1
for 1
the 1
debt 1
i 1
had 1
but 1
to 1
mention 1
the 1
fact 1
to 1
mr 1
johnson 1
and 1
he 1
forthwith 1
advanced 1
the 1
money 1
we 1
now 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
safety 1
and 1
to 1
prepare 1
ourselves 1
for 1
the 1
duties 1
and 1
responsibilities 1
of 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
freedom 1
on 1
the 1
morning 1
after 1
our 1
arrival 1
at 1
new 1
bedford 1
while 1
at 1
the 1
breakfast 1
table 1
the 1
question 1
arose 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
name 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
called 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
given 1
me 1
by 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
frederick 1
augustus 1
washington 1
bailey 1
i 1
however 1
had 1
dispensed 1
with 1
the 1
two 1
middle 1
names 1
long 1
before 1
i 1
left 1
maryland 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
generally 1
known 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
frederick 1
bailey 1
i 1
started 1
from 1
baltimore 1
bearing 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
stanley 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
new 1
york 1
i 1
again 1
changed 1
my 1
name 1
to 1
frederick 1
johnson 1
and 1
thought 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
last 1
change 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
to 1
new 1
bedford 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
necessary 1
again 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
name 1
the 1
reason 1
of 1
this 1
necessity 1
was 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
so 1
many 1
johnsons 1
in 1
new 1
bedford 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
quite 1
difficult 1
to 1
distinguish 1
between 1
them 1
i 1
gave 1
mr 1
johnson 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
choosing 1
me 1
a 1
name 1
but 1
told 1
him 1
he 1
must 1
not 1
take 1
from 1
me 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
frederick 1
i 1
must 1
hold 1
on 1
to 1
that 1
to 1
preserve 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
my 1
identity 1
mr 1
johnson 1
had 1
just 1
been 1
reading 1
the 1
lady 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
suggested 1
that 1
my 1
name 1
be 1
douglass 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
until 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
called 1
frederick 1
douglass 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
more 1
widely 1
known 1
by 1
that 1
name 1
than 1
by 1
either 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
i 1
shall 1
continue 1
to 1
use 1
it 1
as 1
my 1
own 1
i 1
was 1
quite 1
disappointed 1
at 1
the 1
general 1
appearance 1
of 1
things 1
in 1
new 1
bedford 1
the 1
impression 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
received 1
respecting 1
the 1
character 1
and 1
condition 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
the 1
north 1
i 1
found 1
to 1
be 1
singularly 1
erroneous 1
i 1
had 1
very 1
strangely 1
supposed 1
while 1
in 1
slavery 1
that 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
comforts 1
and 1
scarcely 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
luxuries 1
of 1
life 1
were 1
enjoyed 1
at 1
the 1
north 1
compared 1
with 1
what 1
were 1
enjoyed 1
by 1
the 1
slaveholders 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
i 1
probably 1
came 1
to 1
this 1
conclusion 1
from 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
northern 1
people 1
owned 1
no 1
slaves 1
i 1
supposed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
about 1
upon 1
a 1
level 1
with 1
the 1
non 1
slaveholding 1
population 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
i 1
knew 1
_they_ 1
were 1
exceedingly 1
poor 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
to 1
regard 1
their 1
poverty 1
as 1
the 1
necessary 1
consequence 1
of 1
their 1
being 1
non 1
slaveholders 1
i 1
had 1
somehow 1
imbibed 1
the 1
opinion 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
slaves 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
wealth 1
and 1
very 1
little 1
refinement 1
and 1
upon 1
coming 1
to 1
the 1
north 1
i 1
expected 1
to 1
meet 1
with 1
a 1
rough 1
hard 1
handed 1
and 1
uncultivated 1
population 1
living 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
spartan 1
like 1
simplicity 1
knowing 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
ease 1
luxury 1
pomp 1
and 1
grandeur 1
of 1
southern 1
slaveholders 1
such 1
being 1
my 1
conjectures 1
any 1
one 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
new 1
bedford 1
may 1
very 1
readily 1
infer 1
how 1
palpably 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
seen 1
my 1
mistake 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
i 1
reached 1
new 1
bedford 1
i 1
visited 1
the 1
wharves 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
shipping 1
here 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
surrounded 1
with 1
the 1
strongest 1
proofs 1
of 1
wealth 1
lying 1
at 1
the 1
wharves 1
and 1
riding 1
in 1
the 1
stream 1
i 1
saw 1
many 1
ships 1
of 1
the 1
finest 1
model 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
order 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
largest 1
size 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
left 1
i 1
was 1
walled 1
in 1
by 1
granite 1
warehouses 1
of 1
the 1
widest 1
dimensions 1
stowed 1
to 1
their 1
utmost 1
capacity 1
with 1
the 1
necessaries 1
and 1
comforts 1
of 1
life 1
added 1
to 1
this 1
almost 1
every 1
body 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
work 1
but 1
noiselessly 1
so 1
compared 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
to 1
in 1
baltimore 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
loud 1
songs 1
heard 1
from 1
those 1
engaged 1
in 1
loading 1
and 1
unloading 1
ships 1
i 1
heard 1
no 1
deep 1
oaths 1
or 1
horrid 1
curses 1
on 1
the 1
laborer 1
i 1
saw 1
no 1
whipping 1
of 1
men 1
but 1
all 1
seemed 1
to 1
go 1
smoothly 1
on 1
every 1
man 1
appeared 1
to 1
understand 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
went 1
at 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
sober 1
yet 1
cheerful 1
earnestness 1
which 1
betokened 1
the 1
deep 1
interest 1
which 1
he 1
felt 1
in 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
dignity 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
me 1
this 1
looked 1
exceedingly 1
strange 1
from 1
the 1
wharves 1
i 1
strolled 1
around 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
town 1
gazing 1
with 1
wonder 1
and 1
admiration 1
at 1
the 1
splendid 1
churches 1
beautiful 1
dwellings 1
and 1
finely 1
cultivated 1
gardens 1
evincing 1
an 1
amount 1
of 1
wealth 1
comfort 1
taste 1
and 1
refinement 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
in 1
any 1
part 1
of 1
slaveholding 1
maryland 1
every 1
thing 1
looked 1
clean 1
new 1
and 1
beautiful 1
i 1
saw 1
few 1
or 1
no 1
dilapidated 1
houses 1
with 1
poverty 1
stricken 1
inmates 1
no 1
half 1
naked 1
children 1
and 1
barefooted 1
women 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
to 1
see 1
in 1
hillsborough 1
easton 1
st 1
michael 1
s 1
and 1
baltimore 1
the 1
people 1
looked 1
more 1
able 1
stronger 1
healthier 1
and 1
happier 1
than 1
those 1
of 1
maryland 1
i 1
was 1
for 1
once 1
made 1
glad 1
by 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
extreme 1
wealth 1
without 1
being 1
saddened 1
by 1
seeing 1
extreme 1
poverty 1
but 1
the 1
most 1
astonishing 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
thing 1
to 1
me 1
was 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
the 1
colored 1
people 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
of 1
whom 1
like 1
myself 1
had 1
escaped 1
thither 1
as 1
a 1
refuge 1
from 1
the 1
hunters 1
of 1
men 1
i 1
found 1
many 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
seven 1
years 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
chains 1
living 1
in 1
finer 1
houses 1
and 1
evidently 1
enjoying 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
comforts 1
of 1
life 1
than 1
the 1
average 1
of 1
slaveholders 1
in 1
maryland 1
i 1
will 1
venture 1
to 1
assert 1
that 1
my 1
friend 1
mr 1
nathan 1
johnson 1
of 1
whom 1
i 1
can 1
say 1
with 1
a 1
grateful 1
heart 1
i 1
was 1
hungry 1
and 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
meat 1
i 1
was 1
thirsty 1
and 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
drink 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
me 1
in 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
neater 1
house 1
dined 1
at 1
a 1
better 1
table 1
took 1
paid 1
for 1
and 1
read 1
more 1
newspapers 1
better 1
understood 1
the 1
moral 1
religious 1
and 1
political 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
nation 1
than 1
nine 1
tenths 1
of 1
the 1
slaveholders 1
in 1
talbot 1
county 1
maryland 1
yet 1
mr 1
johnson 1
was 1
a 1
working 1
man 1
his 1
hands 1
were 1
hardened 1
by 1
toil 1
and 1
not 1
his 1
alone 1
but 1
those 1
also 1
of 1
mrs 1
johnson 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
colored 1
people 1
much 1
more 1
spirited 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
supposed 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
i 1
found 1
among 1
them 1
a 1
determination 1
to 1
protect 1
each 1
other 1
from 1
the 1
blood 1
thirsty 1
kidnapper 1
at 1
all 1
hazards 1
soon 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
i 1
was 1
told 1
of 1
a 1
circumstance 1
which 1
illustrated 1
their 1
spirit 1
a 1
colored 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
fugitive 1
slave 1
were 1
on 1
unfriendly 1
terms 1
the 1
former 1
was 1
heard 1
to 1
threaten 1
the 1
latter 1
with 1
informing 1
his 1
master 1
of 1
his 1
whereabouts 1
straightway 1
a 1
meeting 1
was 1
called 1
among 1
the 1
colored 1
people 1
under 1
the 1
stereotyped 1
notice 1
business 1
of 1
importance 1
the 1
betrayer 1
was 1
invited 1
to 1
attend 1
the 1
people 1
came 1
at 1
the 1
appointed 1
hour 1
and 1
organized 1
the 1
meeting 1
by 1
appointing 1
a 1
very 1
religious 1
old 1
gentleman 1
as 1
president 1
who 1
i 1
believe 1
made 1
a 1
prayer 1
after 1
which 1
he 1
addressed 1
the 1
meeting 1
as 1
follows 1
_friends 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
him 1
here 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
recommend 1
that 1
you 1
young 1
men 1
just 1
take 1
him 1
outside 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
_ 1
with 1
this 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
them 1
bolted 1
at 1
him 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
intercepted 1
by 1
some 1
more 1
timid 1
than 1
themselves 1
and 1
the 1
betrayer 1
escaped 1
their 1
vengeance 1
and 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
seen 1
in 1
new 1
bedford 1
since 1
i 1
believe 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
no 1
more 1
such 1
threats 1
and 1
should 1
there 1
be 1
hereafter 1
i 1
doubt 1
not 1
that 1
death 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
consequence 1
i 1
found 1
employment 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
in 1
stowing 1
a 1
sloop 1
with 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
oil 1
it 1
was 1
new 1
dirty 1
and 1
hard 1
work 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
went 1
at 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
glad 1
heart 1
and 1
a 1
willing 1
hand 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
my 1
own 1
master 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
happy 1
moment 1
the 1
rapture 1
of 1
which 1
can 1
be 1
understood 1
only 1
by 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
slaves 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
work 1
the 1
reward 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
entirely 1
my 1
own 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
master 1
hugh 1
standing 1
ready 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
earned 1
the 1
money 1
to 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
worked 1
that 1
day 1
with 1
a 1
pleasure 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
before 1
experienced 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
for 1
myself 1
and 1
newly 1
married 1
wife 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
starting 1
point 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
existence 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
through 1
with 1
that 1
job 1
i 1
went 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
a 1
job 1
of 1
calking 1
but 1
such 1
was 1
the 1
strength 1
of 1
prejudice 1
against 1
color 1
among 1
the 1
white 1
calkers 1
that 1
they 1
refused 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
no 1
employment 1
i 1
am 1
told 1
that 1
colored 1
persons 1
can 1
now 1
get 1
employment 1
at 1
calking 1
in 1
new 1
bedford 1
a 1
result 1
of 1
anti 1
slavery 1
effort 1
finding 1
my 1
trade 1
of 1
no 1
immediate 1
benefit 1
i 1
threw 1
off 1
my 1
calking 1
habiliments 1
and 1
prepared 1
myself 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
work 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
to 1
do 1
mr 1
johnson 1
kindly 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
his 1
wood 1
horse 1
and 1
saw 1
and 1
i 1
very 1
soon 1
found 1
myself 1
a 1
plenty 1
of 1
work 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
work 1
too 1
hard 1
none 1
too 1
dirty 1
i 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
saw 1
wood 1
shovel 1
coal 1
carry 1
wood 1
sweep 1
the 1
chimney 1
or 1
roll 1
oil 1
casks 1
all 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
did 1
for 1
nearly 1
three 1
years 1
in 1
new 1
bedford 1
before 1
i 1
became 1
known 1
to 1
the 1
anti 1
slavery 1
world 1
in 1
about 1
four 1
months 1
after 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
new 1
bedford 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
inquired 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
liberator 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
did 1
but 1
just 1
having 1
made 1
my 1
escape 1
from 1
slavery 1
i 1
remarked 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
it 1
then 1
i 1
however 1
finally 1
became 1
a 1
subscriber 1
to 1
it 1
the 1
paper 1
came 1
and 1
i 1
read 1
it 1
from 1
week 1
to 1
week 1
with 1
such 1
feelings 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
quite 1
idle 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
attempt 1
to 1
describe 1
the 1
paper 1
became 1
my 1
meat 1
and 1
my 1
drink 1
my 1
soul 1
was 1
set 1
all 1
on 1
fire 1
its 1
sympathy 1
for 1
my 1
brethren 1
in 1
bonds 1
its 1
scathing 1
denunciations 1
of 1
slaveholders 1
its 1
faithful 1
exposures 1
of 1
slavery 1
and 1
its 1
powerful 1
attacks 1
upon 1
the 1
upholders 1
of 1
the 1
institution 1
sent 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
joy 1
through 1
my 1
soul 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
felt 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
long 1
been 1
a 1
reader 1
of 1
the 1
liberator 1
before 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
pretty 1
correct 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
principles 1
measures 1
and 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
anti 1
slavery 1
reform 1
i 1
took 1
right 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
cause 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
but 1
little 1
but 1
what 1
i 1
could 1
i 1
did 1
with 1
a 1
joyful 1
heart 1
and 1
never 1
felt 1
happier 1
than 1
when 1
in 1
an 1
anti 1
slavery 1
meeting 1
i 1
seldom 1
had 1
much 1
to 1
say 1
at 1
the 1
meetings 1
because 1
what 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
say 1
was 1
said 1
so 1
much 1
better 1
by 1
others 1
but 1
while 1
attending 1
an 1
anti 1
slavery 1
convention 1
at 1
nantucket 1
on 1
the 1
11th 1
of 1
august 1
1841 1
i 1
felt 1
strongly 1
moved 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
much 1
urged 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
by 1
mr 1
william 1
c 1
coffin 1
a 1
gentleman 1
who 1
had 1
heard 1
me 1
speak 1
in 1
the 1
colored 1
people 1
s 1
meeting 1
at 1
new 1
bedford 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
severe 1
cross 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
reluctantly 1
the 1
truth 1
was 1
i 1
felt 1
myself 1
a 1
slave 1
and 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
speaking 1
to 1
white 1
people 1
weighed 1
me 1
down 1
i 1
spoke 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
when 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
freedom 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
i 1
desired 1
with 1
considerable 1
ease 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
until 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
engaged 1
in 1
pleading 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
brethren 1
with 1
what 1
success 1
and 1
with 1
what 1
devotion 1
i 1
leave 1
those 1
acquainted 1
with 1
my 1
labors 1
to 1
decide 1
appendix 1
i 1
find 1
since 1
reading 1
over 1
the 1
foregoing 1
narrative 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
in 1
several 1
instances 1
spoken 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
tone 1
and 1
manner 1
respecting 1
religion 1
as 1
may 1
possibly 1
lead 1
those 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
my 1
religious 1
views 1
to 1
suppose 1
me 1
an 1
opponent 1
of 1
all 1
religion 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
liability 1
of 1
such 1
misapprehension 1
i 1
deem 1
it 1
proper 1
to 1
append 1
the 1
following 1
brief 1
explanation 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
respecting 1
and 1
against 1
religion 1
i 1
mean 1
strictly 1
to 1
apply 1
to 1
the 1
_slaveholding 1
religion_ 1
of 1
this 1
land 1
and 1
with 1
no 1
possible 1
reference 1
to 1
christianity 1
proper 1
for 1
between 1
the 1
christianity 1
of 1
this 1
land 1
and 1
the 1
christianity 1
of 1
christ 1
i 1
recognize 1
the 1
widest 1
possible 1
difference 1
so 1
wide 1
that 1
to 1
receive 1
the 1
one 1
as 1
good 1
pure 1
and 1
holy 1
is 1
of 1
necessity 1
to 1
reject 1
the 1
other 1
as 1
bad 1
corrupt 1
and 1
wicked 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
friend 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
is 1
of 1
necessity 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
enemy 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
i 1
love 1
the 1
pure 1
peaceable 1
and 1
impartial 1
christianity 1
of 1
christ 1
i 1
therefore 1
hate 1
the 1
corrupt 1
slaveholding 1
women 1
whipping 1
cradle 1
plundering 1
partial 1
and 1
hypocritical 1
christianity 1
of 1
this 1
land 1
indeed 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
no 1
reason 1
but 1
the 1
most 1
deceitful 1
one 1
for 1
calling 1
the 1
religion 1
of 1
this 1
land 1
christianity 1
i 1
look 1
upon 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
climax 1
of 1
all 1
misnomers 1
the 1
boldest 1
of 1
all 1
frauds 1
and 1
the 1
grossest 1
of 1
all 1
libels 1
never 1
was 1
there 1
a 1
clearer 1
case 1
of 1
stealing 1
the 1
livery 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
of 1
heaven 1
to 1
serve 1
the 1
devil 1
in 1
i 1
am 1
filled 1
with 1
unutterable 1
loathing 1
when 1
i 1
contemplate 1
the 1
religious 1
pomp 1
and 1
show 1
together 1
with 1
the 1
horrible 1
inconsistencies 1
which 1
every 1
where 1
surround 1
me 1
we 1
have 1
men 1
stealers 1
for 1
ministers 1
women 1
whippers 1
for 1
missionaries 1
and 1
cradle 1
plunderers 1
for 1
church 1
members 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
wields 1
the 1
blood 1
clotted 1

during 1
the 1

fills 1
the 1
pulpit 1

claims 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
minister 1
of 1
the 1
meek 1
and 1
lowly 1
jesus 1

man 1

robs 1
me 1
of 1

at 1
the 1

of 1

me 1
as 1
a 1
class 1
leader 1
on 1

morning 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
the 1

of 1

the 1
path 1
of 1
salvation 1

forth 1
as 1

pious 1

who 1
proclaims 1
it 1
a 1
religious 1
duty 1
to 1
read 1
the 1

denies 1
me 1

of 1

woe 1
unto 1
you 1
scribes 1
and 1
pharisees 1
hypocrites 1
for 1
ye 1
are 1
like 1
unto 1
whited 1
sepulchres 1
which 1
indeed 1
appear 1
beautiful 1
outward 1

of 1
dead 1
men 1

of 1
all 1
uncleanness 1
even 1
so 1
ye 1
also 1
outwardly 1
appear 1
righteous 1
unto 1
men 1
but 1
within 1
ye 1
are 1
full 1
of 1
hypocrisy 1
and 1
iniquity 1
dark 1
and 1
terrible 1
as 1
is 1
this 1

could 1
any 1
thing 1
be 1
more 1
true 1
of 1
our 1
churches 1

would 1
be 1
shocked 1
at 1
the 1
proposition 1
of 1
fellowshipping 1
a 1
sheep 1

with 1
pharisaical 1
strictness 1
to 1
the 1
outward 1
forms 1
of 1
religion 1

at 1

the 1
weightier 1
matters 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
judgment 1
mercy 1

they 1

represented 1
as 1
professing 1
to 1
love 1
god 1
whom 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1

love 1

side 1
of 1
the 1

the 1
bible 1
put 1
into 1
his 1

and 1
totally 1
neglect 1
the 1
heathen 1
at 1
their 1
own 1
doors 1
such 1
is 1
very 1
briefly 1
my 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
religion 1
of 1
this 1
land 1
and 1
to 1
avoid 1
any 1
misunderstanding 1
growing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
general 1
terms 1
i 1
mean 1
by 1
the 1
religion 1
of 1
this 1
land 1
that 1
which 1
is 1
revealed 1
in 1
the 1
words 1
deeds 1
and 1
actions 1
of 1
those 1
bodies 1
north 1
and 1
south 1
calling 1
themselves 1
christian 1
churches 1
and 1
yet 1
in 1
union 1
with 1
slaveholders 1
it 1
is 1
against 1
religion 1
as 1
presented 1
by 1
these 1
bodies 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
felt 1
it 1
my 1
duty 1
to 1
testify 1
i 1
conclude 1
these 1
remarks 1
by 1
copying 1
the 1
following 1
portrait 1
of 1
the 1
religion 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
which 1
is 1
by 1
communion 1
and 1
fellowship 1
the 1
religion 1
of 1
the 1
north 1
which 1
i 1
soberly 1
affirm 1
is 1
true 1
to 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
without 1
caricature 1
or 1
the 1
slightest 1
exaggeration 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
drawn 1
several 1
years 1
before 1
the 1
present 1
anti 1
slavery 1
agitation 1
began 1
by 1
a 1
northern 1
methodist 1
preacher 1
who 1
while 1
residing 1
at 1
the 1
south 1
had 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
see 1
slaveholding 1
morals 1
manners 1
and 1
piety 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
eyes 1

down 1

among 1

out 1

did 1

but 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
have 1
a 1
single 1
barley 1
corn 1
than 1
a 1
peck 1
of 1

wolf 1
and 1
the 1
lamb 1

upon 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
wolf 1
was 1
lapping 1
at 1
a 1
spring 1
on 1
a 1
hillside 1
when 1
looking 1
up 1
what 1
should 1
he 1
see 1
but 1
a 1
lamb 1
just 1
beginning 1
to 1
drink 1
a 1
little 1
lower 1
down 1
there 1
s 1
my 1
supper 1
thought 1
he 1
if 1
only 1
i 1
can 1
find 1
some 1
excuse 1
to 1
seize 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
lamb 1
how 1
dare 1
you 1
muddle 1
the 1
water 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
drinking 1
nay 1
master 1

said 1
lambikin 1
if 1

water 1
be 1
muddy 1
up 1
there 1
i 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
it 1
for 1
it 1
runs 1
down 1
from 1
you 1
to 1
me 1
well 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
call 1
me 1
bad 1
names 1
this 1
time 1
last 1
year 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
said 1
the 1
lamb 1
i 1
am 1
only 1
six 1
months 1
old 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
snarled 1
the 1
wolf 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
you 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
father 1
and 1
with 1
that 1
he 1
rushed 1
upon 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
lamb 1
and 1
warra 1
warra 1
warra 1
warra 1
warra 1
ate 1
her 1
all 1
up 1
but 1
before 1
she 1
died 1
she 1
gasped 1
out 1
any 1
excuse 1
will 1
serve 1
a 1
tyrant 1
the 1
dog 1
and 1
the 1
shadow 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
a 1
dog 1
had 1
got 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
meat 1
and 1
was 1
carrying 1
it 1
home 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
in 1
peace 1
now 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
home 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
cross 1
a 1
plank 1
lying 1
across 1
a 1
running 1
brook 1
as 1
he 1
crossed 1
he 1
looked 1
down 1
and 1
saw 1
his 1
own 1
shadow 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
beneath 1
thinking 1
it 1
was 1
another 1
dog 1
with 1
another 1
piece 1
of 1
meat 1
he 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
also 1
so 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
snap 1
at 1
the 1
shadow 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
mouth 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
meat 1
fell 1
out 1
dropped 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
was 1
never 1
seen 1
more 1
beware 1
lest 1
you 1
lose 1
the 1
substance 1
by 1
grasping 1
at 1
the 1
shadow 1
the 1
lion 1
s 1
share 1
the 1
lion 1
went 1
once 1
a 1
hunting 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
fox 1
the 1
jackal 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
they 1
hunted 1
and 1
they 1
hunted 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
surprised 1
a 1
stag 1
and 1
soon 1
took 1
its 1
life 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
question 1
how 1
the 1
spoil 1
should 1
be 1
divided 1
quarter 1
me 1
this 1
stag 1
roared 1
the 1
lion 1
so 1
the 1
other 1
animals 1
skinned 1
it 1
and 1
cut 1
it 1
into 1
four 1
parts 1
then 1
the 1
lion 1
took 1
his 1
stand 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
carcass 1
and 1
pronounced 1
judgment 1
the 1
first 1
quarter 1
is 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
capacity 1
as 1
king 1
of 1
beasts 1
the 1
second 1
is 1
mine 1
as 1
arbiter 1
another 1
share 1
comes 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
my 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
chase 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
fourth 1
quarter 1
well 1
as 1
for 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
which 1
of 1
you 1
will 1
dare 1
to 1
lay 1
a 1
paw 1
upon 1
it 1
humph 1
grumbled 1
the 1
fox 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
away 1
with 1
his 1
tail 1
between 1
his 1
legs 1
but 1
he 1
spoke 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
growl 1
you 1
may 1
share 1
the 1
labours 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
share 1
the 1
spoil 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
the 1
crane 1
a 1
wolf 1
had 1
been 1
gorging 1
on 1
an 1
animal 1
he 1
had 1
killed 1
when 1
suddenly 1
a 1
small 1
bone 1
in 1
the 1
meat 1
stuck 1
in 1
his 1
throat 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
swallow 1
it 1
he 1
soon 1
felt 1
terrible 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
throat 1
and 1
ran 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
groaning 1
and 1
groaning 1
and 1
seeking 1
for 1
something 1
to 1
relieve 1
the 1
pain 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
induce 1
every 1
one 1
he 1
met 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
bone 1
i 1
would 1
give 1
anything 1
said 1
he 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
take 1
it 1
out 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
crane 1
agreed 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
wolf 1
to 1
lie 1
on 1
his 1
side 1
and 1
open 1
his 1
jaws 1
as 1
wide 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
then 1
the 1
crane 1
put 1
its 1
long 1
neck 1
down 1
the 1
wolf 1
s 1
throat 1
and 1
with 1
its 1
beak 1
loosened 1
the 1
bone 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
got 1
it 1
out 1
will 1
you 1
kindly 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
reward 1
you 1
promised 1
said 1
the 1
crane 1
the 1
wolf 1
grinned 1
and 1
showed 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
said 1
be 1
content 1
you 1
have 1
put 1
your 1
head 1
inside 1
a 1
wolf 1
s 1
mouth 1
and 1
taken 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
in 1
safety 1
that 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
reward 1
enough 1
for 1
you 1
gratitude 1
and 1
greed 1
go 1
not 1
together 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
serpent 1
a 1
countryman 1
s 1
son 1
by 1
accident 1
trod 1
upon 1
a 1
serpent 1
s 1
tail 1
which 1
turned 1
and 1
bit 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
died 1
the 1
father 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
got 1
his 1
axe 1
and 1
pursuing 1
the 1
serpent 1
cut 1
off 1
part 1
of 1
its 1
tail 1
so 1
the 1
serpent 1
in 1
revenge 1
began 1
stinging 1
several 1
of 1
the 1
farmer 1
s 1
cattle 1
and 1
caused 1
him 1
severe 1
loss 1
well 1
the 1
farmer 1
thought 1
it 1
best 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
serpent 1
and 1
brought 1
food 1
and 1
honey 1
to 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
its 1
lair 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
it 1
let 1
s 1
forget 1
and 1
forgive 1
perhaps 1
you 1
were 1
right 1
to 1
punish 1
my 1
son 1
and 1
take 1
vengeance 1
on 1
my 1
cattle 1
but 1
surely 1
i 1
was 1
right 1
in 1
trying 1
to 1
revenge 1
him 1
now 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
both 1
satisfied 1
why 1
should 1
not 1
we 1
be 1

the 1

visit 1
to 1
his 1
cousin 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
he 1
was 1
rough 1
and 1
ready 1
this 1
cousin 1
but 1
he 1
loved 1
his 1
town 1

heartily 1
welcome 1

offered 1

at 1

week 1

room 1
there 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
a 1
fine 1
feast 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
two 1
mice 1
were 1
eating 1
up 1
jellies 1
and 1
cakes 1
and 1

the 1

and 1
the 1

fox 1
once 1
saw 1
a 1
crow 1
fly 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cheese 1
in 1
its 1
beak 1
and 1
settle 1
on 1
a 1
branch 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
that 1
s 1
for 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
fox 1
said 1
master 1
reynard 1
and 1
he 1
walked 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
good 1
day 1
mistress 1
crow 1
he 1
cried 1
how 1
well 1
you 1

looking 1
to 1
day 1
how 1
glossy 1
your 1
feathers 1
how 1
bright 1
your 1
eye 1
i 1
feel 1
sure 1
your 1
voice 1
must 1
surpass 1
that 1
of 1
other 1
birds 1
just 1
as 1
your 1
figure 1
does 1
let 1
me 1
hear 1
but 1
one 1
song 1
from 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
greet 1
you 1
as 1
the 1
queen 1
of 1
birds 1
the 1
crow 1
lifted 1
up 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
caw 1
her 1
best 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
she 1
opened 1
her 1
mouth 1
the 1
piece 1
of 1
cheese 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
snapped 1
up 1
by 1
master 1
fox 1
that 1
will 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
i 1
wanted 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
your 1
cheese 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
advice 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
do 1
not 1
trust 1
flatterers 1
the 1
sick 1
lion 1
a 1
lion 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
days 1
and 1
lay 1
sick 1
unto 1
death 1
at 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
his 1
cave 1
gasping 1
for 1
breath 1
the 1
animals 1
his 1
subjects 1
came 1
round 1
him 1
and 1
drew 1
nearer 1
as 1
he 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
helpless 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
death 1
they 1
thought 1
to 1
themselves 1
now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
pay 1
off 1
old 1
grudges 1
so 1
the 1
boar 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
drove 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
tusks 1
then 1
a 1
bull 1
gored 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
horns 1
still 1
the 1
lion 1
lay 1
helpless 1
before 1
them 1
so 1
the 1
ass 1
feeling 1
quite 1
safe 1
from 1
danger 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
turning 1
his 1
tail 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
kicked 1
up 1
his 1
heels 1
into 1
his 1
face 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
double 1
death 1
growled 1
the 1
lion 1
only 1
cowards 1
insult 1
dying 1
majesty 1
the 1
ass 1
and 1
the 1
lapdog 1
a 1
farmer 1
one 1
day 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
stables 1
to 1
see 1
to 1
his 1
beasts 1
of 1
burden 1
among 1
them 1
was 1
his 1
favourite 1
ass 1
that 1
was 1
always 1
well 1
fed 1
and 1
often 1
carried 1
his 1
master 1
with 1
the 1
farmer 1
came 1
his 1
lapdog 1
who 1
danced 1
about 1
and 1
licked 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
frisked 1
about 1
as 1
happy 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
the 1
farmer 1
felt 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
gave 1
the 1
lapdog 1
some 1
dainty 1
food 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
while 1
he 1
gave 1
his 1
orders 1
to 1
his 1
servants 1
the 1
lapdog 1
jumped 1
into 1
his 1
master 1
s 1
lap 1
and 1
lay 1
there 1
blinking 1
while 1
the 1
farmer 1
stroked 1
his 1
ears 1
the 1
ass 1
seeing 1
this 1
broke 1
loose 1
from 1
his 1
halter 1
and 1
commenced 1
prancing 1
about 1
in 1
imitation 1
of 1
the 1
lapdog 1
the 1
farmer 1
could 1
not 1
hold 1
his 1
sides 1
with 1
laughter 1
so 1
the 1
ass 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
feet 1
upon 1
the 1
farmer 1
s 1
shoulder 1
attempted 1
to 1
climb 1
into 1
his 1
lap 1
the 1
farmer 1
s 1
servants 1
rushed 1
up 1
with 1
sticks 1
and 1
pitchforks 1
and 1
soon 1
taught 1
the 1
ass 1
that 1
clumsy 1
jesting 1
is 1
no 1
joke 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
the 1
mouse 1
once 1
when 1
a 1
lion 1
was 1
asleep 1
a 1
little 1
mouse 1
began 1
running 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
upon 1
him 1
this 1
soon 1
wakened 1
the 1
lion 1
who 1
placed 1
his 1
huge 1
paw 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
opened 1
his 1
big 1
jaws 1
to 1
swallow 1
him 1
pardon 1
o 1
king 1
cried 1
the 1
little 1
mouse 1
forgive 1
me 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
it 1
who 1
knows 1
but 1
what 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
do 1
you 1
a 1
turn 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
days 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
so 1
tickled 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
mouse 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
lifted 1
up 1
his 1
paw 1
and 1
let 1
him 1
go 1
some 1
time 1
after 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
caught 1
in 1
a 1
trap 1
and 1
the 1
hunters 1
who 1
desired 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
alive 1
to 1
the 1
king 1
tied 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
tree 1
while 1
they 1
went 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
a 1
waggon 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
on 1
just 1
then 1
the 1
little 1
mouse 1
happened 1
to 1
pass 1
by 1
and 1
seeing 1
the 1
sad 1
plight 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
soon 1
gnawed 1
away 1
the 1
ropes 1
that 1
bound 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
beasts 1
was 1
i 1
not 1
right 1
said 1
the 1
little 1
mouse 1
little 1
friends 1
may 1
prove 1
great 1
friends 1
the 1
swallow 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
birds 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
a 1
countryman 1
was 1
sowing 1
some 1
hemp 1
seeds 1
in 1
a 1
field 1
where 1
a 1
swallow 1
and 1
some 1
other 1
birds 1
were 1
hopping 1
about 1
picking 1
up 1
their 1
food 1
beware 1
of 1
that 1
man 1
quoth 1
the 1
swallow 1
why 1
what 1
is 1
he 1
doing 1
said 1
the 1
others 1
that 1
is 1
hemp 1
seed 1
he 1
is 1
sowing 1
be 1
careful 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
seeds 1
or 1
else 1
you 1
will 1
repent 1
it 1
the 1
birds 1
paid 1
no 1
heed 1
to 1
the 1
swallow 1
s 1
words 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
hemp 1
grew 1
up 1
and 1
was 1
made 1
into 1
cord 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
cords 1
nets 1
were 1
made 1
and 1
many 1
a 1
bird 1
that 1
had 1
despised 1
the 1
swallow 1
s 1
advice 1
was 1
caught 1
in 1
nets 1
made 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
very 1
hemp 1
what 1
did 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
swallow 1
destroy 1
the 1
seed 1
of 1
evil 1
or 1
it 1
will 1
grow 1
up 1
to 1
your 1
ruin 1
the 1
frogs 1
desiring 1
a 1
king 1
the 1
frogs 1
were 1
living 1
as 1
happy 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
marshy 1
swamp 1
that 1
just 1
suited 1
them 1
they 1
went 1
splashing 1
about 1
caring 1
for 1
nobody 1
and 1
nobody 1
troubling 1
with 1
them 1
but 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
thought 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
right 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
a 1
king 1
and 1
a 1
proper 1
constitution 1
so 1
they 1
determined 1
to 1
send 1
up 1
a 1
petition 1
to 1
jove 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
what 1
they 1
wanted 1
mighty 1
jove 1
they 1
cried 1
send 1
unto 1
us 1
a 1
king 1
that 1
will 1
rule 1
over 1
us 1
and 1
keep 1
us 1
in 1
order 1
jove 1
laughed 1
at 1
their 1
croaking 1
and 1
threw 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
swamp 1
a 1
huge 1
log 1
which 1
came 1
down 1
splashing 1
into 1
the 1
swamp 1
the 1
frogs 1
were 1
frightened 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
lives 1
by 1
the 1
commotion 1
made 1
in 1
their 1
midst 1
and 1
all 1
rushed 1
to 1
the 1
bank 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
horrible 1
monster 1
but 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
seeing 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
boldest 1
of 1
them 1
ventured 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
log 1
and 1
even 1
dared 1
to 1
touch 1
it 1
still 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
then 1
the 1
greatest 1
hero 1
of 1
the 1
frogs 1
jumped 1
upon 1
the 1
log 1
and 1
commenced 1
dancing 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
upon 1
it 1
thereupon 1
all 1
the 1
frogs 1
came 1
and 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
and 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
the 1
frogs 1
went 1
about 1
their 1
business 1
every 1
day 1
without 1
taking 1
the 1
slightest 1
notice 1
of 1
their 1
new 1
king 1
log 1
lying 1
in 1
their 1
midst 1
but 1
this 1
did 1
not 1
suit 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
sent 1
another 1
petition 1
to 1
jove 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
we 1
want 1
a 1
real 1
king 1
one 1
that 1
will 1
really 1
rule 1
over 1
us 1
now 1
this 1
made 1
jove 1
angry 1
so 1
he 1
sent 1
among 1
them 1
a 1
big 1
stork 1
that 1
soon 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
gobbling 1
them 1
all 1
up 1
then 1
the 1
frogs 1
repented 1
when 1
too 1
late 1
better 1
no 1
rule 1
than 1
cruel 1
rule 1
the 1
mountains 1
in 1
labour 1
one 1
day 1
the 1
countrymen 1
noticed 1
that 1
the 1
mountains 1
were 1
in 1
labour 1
smoke 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
summits 1
the 1
earth 1
was 1
quaking 1
at 1
their 1
feet 1
trees 1
were 1
crashing 1
and 1
huge 1
rocks 1
were 1
tumbling 1
they 1
felt 1
sure 1
that 1
something 1
horrible 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
they 1
all 1
gathered 1
together 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
terrible 1
thing 1
this 1
could 1
be 1
they 1
waited 1
and 1
they 1
waited 1
but 1
nothing 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
still 1
more 1
violent 1
earthquake 1
and 1
a 1
huge 1
gap 1
appeared 1
in 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
they 1
all 1
fell 1
down 1
upon 1
their 1
knees 1
and 1
waited 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
a 1
teeny 1
tiny 1
mouse 1
poked 1
its 1
little 1
head 1
and 1
bristles 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
gap 1
and 1
came 1
running 1
down 1
towards 1
them 1
and 1
ever 1
after 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
say 1
much 1
outcry 1
little 1
outcome 1
the 1
hares 1
and 1
the 1
frogs 1
the 1
hares 1
were 1
so 1
persecuted 1
by 1
the 1
other 1
beasts 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
go 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
single 1
animal 1
approach 1
them 1
off 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
run 1
one 1
day 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
wild 1
horses 1
stampeding 1
about 1
and 1
in 1
quite 1
a 1
panic 1
all 1
the 1
hares 1
scuttled 1
off 1
to 1
a 1
lake 1
hard 1
by 1
determined 1
to 1
drown 1
themselves 1
rather 1
than 1
live 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
continual 1
state 1
of 1
fear 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
they 1
got 1
near 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
frogs 1
frightened 1
in 1
their 1
turn 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
the 1
hares 1
scuttled 1
off 1
and 1
jumped 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
truly 1
said 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
hares 1
things 1
are 1
not 1
so 1
bad 1
as 1
they 1
seem 1
there 1
is 1
always 1
someone 1
worse 1
off 1
than 1
yourself 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
the 1
kid 1
a 1
kid 1
was 1
perched 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
and 1
looking 1
down 1
saw 1
a 1
wolf 1
passing 1
under 1
him 1
immediately 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
revile 1
and 1
attack 1
his 1
enemy 1
murderer 1
and 1
thief 1
he 1
cried 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
here 1
near 1
honest 1
folks 1
houses 1
how 1
dare 1
you 1
make 1
an 1
appearance 1
where 1
your 1
vile 1
deeds 1
are 1
known 1
curse 1
away 1
my 1
young 1
friend 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
it 1
is 1
easy 1
to 1
be 1
brave 1
from 1
a 1
safe 1
distance 1
the 1
woodman 1
and 1
the 1
serpent 1
one 1
wintry 1
day 1
a 1
woodman 1
was 1
tramping 1
home 1
from 1
his 1
work 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
something 1
black 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
snow 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
closer 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
serpent 1
to 1
all 1
appearance 1
dead 1
but 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
bosom 1
to 1
warm 1
while 1
he 1
hurried 1
home 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
got 1
indoors 1
he 1
put 1
the 1
serpent 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
hearth 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
the 1
children 1
watched 1
it 1
and 1
saw 1
it 1
slowly 1
come 1
to 1
life 1
again 1
then 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
stooped 1
down 1
to 1
stroke 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
serpent 1
raised 1
its 1
head 1
and 1
put 1
out 1
its 1
fangs 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
sting 1
the 1
child 1
to 1
death 1
so 1
the 1
woodman 1
seized 1
his 1
axe 1
and 1
with 1
one 1
stroke 1
cut 1
the 1
serpent 1
in 1
two 1
ah 1
said 1
he 1
no 1
gratitude 1
from 1
the 1
wicked 1
the 1
bald 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
fly 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
bald 1
man 1
who 1
sat 1
down 1
after 1
work 1
on 1
a 1
hot 1
summer 1
s 1
day 1
a 1
fly 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
kept 1
buzzing 1
about 1
his 1
bald 1
pate 1
and 1
stinging 1
him 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
the 1
man 1
aimed 1
a 1
blow 1
at 1
his 1
little 1
enemy 1
but 1
acks 1
palm 1
came 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
instead 1
again 1
the 1
fly 1
tormented 1
him 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
wiser 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
will 1
only 1
injure 1
yourself 1
if 1
you 1
take 1
notice 1
of 1
despicable 1
enemies 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
stork 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
stork 1
were 1
on 1
visiting 1
terms 1
and 1
seemed 1
very 1
good 1
friends 1
so 1
the 1
fox 1
invited 1
the 1
stork 1
to 1
dinner 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
joke 1
put 1
nothing 1
before 1
her 1
but 1
some 1
soup 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
shallow 1
dish 1
this 1
the 1
fox 1
could 1
easily 1
lap 1
up 1
but 1
the 1
stork 1
could 1
only 1
wet 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
her 1
long 1
bill 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
meal 1
as 1
hungry 1
as 1
when 1
she 1
began 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
the 1
soup 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
your 1
liking 1
pray 1
do 1
not 1
apologise 1
said 1
the 1
stork 1
i 1
hope 1
you 1
will 1
return 1
this 1
visit 1
and 1
come 1
and 1
dine 1
with 1
me 1
soon 1
so 1
a 1
day 1
was 1
appointed 1
when 1
the 1
fox 1
should 1
visit 1
the 1
stork 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
seated 1
at 1
table 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
for 1
their 1
dinner 1
was 1
contained 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
long 1
necked 1
jar 1
with 1
a 1
narrow 1
mouth 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
fox 1
could 1
not 1
insert 1
his 1
snout 1
so 1
all 1
he 1
could 1
manage 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
lick 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
jar 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
apologise 1
for 1
the 1
dinner 1
said 1
the 1
stork 1
one 1
bad 1
turn 1
deserves 1
another 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
mask 1
a 1
fox 1
had 1
by 1
some 1
means 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
store 1
room 1
of 1
a 1
theatre 1
suddenly 1
he 1
observed 1
a 1
face 1
glaring 1
down 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
frightened 1
but 1
looking 1
more 1
closely 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
mask 1
such 1
as 1
actors 1
use 1
to 1
put 1
over 1
their 1
face 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
you 1
look 1
very 1
fine 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
got 1
any 1
brains 1
outside 1
show 1
is 1
a 1
poor 1
substitute 1
for 1
inner 1
worth 1
the 1
jay 1
and 1
the 1
peacock 1
a 1
jay 1
venturing 1
into 1
a 1
yard 1
where 1
peacocks 1
used 1
to 1
walk 1
found 1
there 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
feathers 1
which 1
had 1
fallen 1
from 1
the 1
peacocks 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
moulting 1
he 1
tied 1
them 1
all 1
to 1
his 1
tail 1
and 1
strutted 1
down 1
towards 1
the 1
peacocks 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
them 1
they 1
soon 1
discovered 1
the 1
cheat 1
and 1
striding 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
pecked 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
plucked 1
away 1
his 1
borrowed 1
plumes 1
so 1
the 1
jay 1
could 1
do 1
no 1
better 1
than 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
jays 1
who 1
had 1
watched 1
his 1
behaviour 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
equally 1
annoyed 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
only 1
fine 1
feathers 1
that 1
make 1
fine 1
birds 1
the 1
frog 1
and 1
the 1
ox 1
oh 1
father 1
said 1
a 1
little 1
frog 1
to 1
the 1
big 1
one 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
pool 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
such 1
a 1
terrible 1
monster 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
mountain 1
with 1
horns 1
on 1
its 1
head 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
tail 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
hoofs 1
divided 1
in 1
two 1
tush 1
child 1
tush 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
frog 1
that 1
was 1
only 1
farmer 1
white 1
s 1
ox 1
it 1
isn 1
t 1
so 1
big 1
either 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
taller 1
than 1
i 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
easily 1
make 1
myself 1
quite 1
as 1
broad 1
just 1
you 1
see 1
so 1
he 1
blew 1
himself 1
out 1
and 1
blew 1
himself 1
out 1
and 1
blew 1
himself 1
out 1
was 1
he 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
that 1
asked 1
he 1
oh 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
frog 1
again 1
the 1
old 1
one 1
blew 1
himself 1
out 1
and 1
asked 1
the 1
young 1
one 1
if 1
the 1
ox 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
that 1
bigger 1
father 1
bigger 1
was 1
the 1
reply 1
so 1
the 1
frog 1
took 1
a 1
deep 1
breath 1
and 1
blew 1
and 1
blew 1
and 1
blew 1
and 1
swelled 1
and 1
swelled 1
and 1
swelled 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
m 1
sure 1
the 1
ox 1
is 1
not 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
this 1
but 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
he 1
burst 1
self 1
conceit 1
may 1
lead 1
to 1
self 1
destruction 1
androcles 1
a 1
slave 1
named 1
androcles 1
once 1
escaped 1
from 1
his 1
master 1
and 1
fled 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
wandering 1
about 1
there 1
he 1
came 1
upon 1
a 1
lion 1
lying 1
down 1
moaning 1
and 1
groaning 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
flee 1
but 1
finding 1
that 1
the 1
lion 1
did 1
not 1
pursue 1
him 1
he 1
turned 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
the 1
lion 1
put 1
out 1
his 1
paw 1
which 1
was 1
all 1
swollen 1
and 1
bleeding 1
and 1
androcles 1
found 1
that 1
a 1
huge 1
thorn 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
causing 1
all 1
the 1
pain 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
the 1
thorn 1
and 1
bound 1
up 1
the 1
paw 1
of 1
the 1
lion 1
who 1
was 1
soon 1
able 1
to 1
rise 1
and 1
lick 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
androcles 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
then 1
the 1
lion 1
took 1
androcles 1
to 1
his 1
cave 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
used 1
to 1
bring 1
him 1
meat 1
from 1
which 1
to 1
live 1
but 1
shortly 1
afterwards 1
both 1
androcles 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
were 1
captured 1
and 1
the 1
slave 1
was 1
sentenced 1
to 1
be 1
thrown 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
after 1
the 1
latter 1
had 1
been 1
kept 1
without 1
food 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
the 1
emperor 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
court 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
spectacle 1
and 1
androcles 1
was 1
led 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
arena 1
soon 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
let 1
loose 1
from 1
his 1
den 1
and 1
rushed 1
bounding 1
and 1
roaring 1
towards 1
his 1
victim 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
to 1
androcles 1
he 1
recognised 1
his 1
friend 1
and 1
fawned 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
licked 1
his 1
hands 1
like 1
a 1
friendly 1
dog 1
the 1
emperor 1
surprised 1
at 1
this 1
summoned 1
androcles 1
to 1
him 1
who 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
whole 1
story 1
whereupon 1
the 1
slave 1
was 1
pardoned 1
and 1
freed 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
let 1
loose 1
to 1
his 1
native 1
forest 1
gratitude 1
is 1
the 1
sign 1
of 1
noble 1
souls 1
the 1
bat 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
the 1
beasts 1
a 1
great 1
conflict 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
come 1
off 1
between 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
the 1
beasts 1
when 1
the 1
two 1
armies 1
were 1
collected 1
together 1
the 1
bat 1
hesitated 1
which 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
birds 1
that 1
passed 1
his 1
perch 1
said 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
beast 1
later 1
on 1
some 1
beasts 1
who 1
were 1
passing 1
underneath 1
him 1
looked 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
bird 1
luckily 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
moment 1
peace 1
was 1
made 1
and 1
no 1
battle 1
took 1
place 1
so 1
the 1
bat 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
join 1
in 1
the 1
rejoicings 1
but 1
they 1
all 1
turned 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
fly 1
away 1
he 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
beasts 1
but 1
soon 1
had 1
to 1
beat 1
a 1
retreat 1
or 1
else 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
torn 1
him 1
to 1
pieces 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
bat 1
i 1
see 1
now 1
he 1
that 1
is 1
neither 1
one 1
thing 1
nor 1
the 1
other 1
has 1
no 1
friends 1
the 1
hart 1
and 1
the 1
hunter 1
the 1
hart 1
was 1
once 1
drinking 1
from 1
a 1
pool 1
and 1
admiring 1
the 1
noble 1
figure 1
he 1
made 1
there 1
ah 1
said 1
he 1
where 1
can 1
you 1
see 1
such 1
noble 1
horns 1
as 1
these 1
with 1
such 1
antlers 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
had 1
legs 1
more 1
worthy 1
to 1
bear 1
such 1
a 1
noble 1
crown 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
they 1
are 1
so 1
slim 1
and 1
slight 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
a 1
hunter 1
approached 1
and 1
sent 1
an 1
arrow 1
whistling 1
after 1
him 1
away 1
bounded 1
the 1
hart 1
and 1
soon 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
his 1
nimble 1
legs 1
was 1
nearly 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
hunter 1
but 1
not 1
noticing 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
he 1
passed 1
under 1
some 1
trees 1
with 1
branches 1
growing 1
low 1
down 1
in 1
which 1
his 1
antlers 1
were 1
caught 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
hunter 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
come 1
up 1
alas 1
alas 1
cried 1
the 1
hart 1
we 1
often 1
despise 1
what 1
is 1
most 1
useful 1
to 1
us 1
the 1
serpent 1
and 1
the 1
file 1
a 1
serpent 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
its 1
wanderings 1
came 1
into 1
an 1
armourer 1
s 1
shop 1
as 1
he 1
glided 1
over 1
the 1
floor 1
he 1
felt 1
his 1
skin 1
pricked 1
by 1
a 1
file 1
lying 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
he 1
turned 1
round 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
dart 1
his 1
fangs 1
into 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
no 1
harm 1
to 1
heavy 1
iron 1
and 1
had 1
soon 1
to 1
give 1
over 1
his 1
wrath 1
it 1
is 1
useless 1
attacking 1
the 1
insensible 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
wood 1
a 1
man 1
came 1
into 1
a 1
wood 1
one 1
day 1
with 1
an 1
axe 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
begged 1
all 1
the 1
trees 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
small 1
branch 1
which 1
he 1
wanted 1
for 1
a 1
particular 1
purpose 1
the 1
trees 1
were 1
good 1
natured 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
branches 1
what 1
did 1
the 1
man 1
do 1
but 1
fix 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
axe 1
head 1
and 1
soon 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
cutting 1
down 1
tree 1
after 1
tree 1
then 1
the 1
trees 1
saw 1
how 1
foolish 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
giving 1
their 1
enemy 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
destroying 1
themselves 1
the 1
dog 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
a 1
gaunt 1
wolf 1
was 1
almost 1
dead 1
with 1
hunger 1
when 1
he 1
happened 1
to 1
meet 1
a 1
house 1
dog 1
who 1
was 1
passing 1
by 1
ah 1
cousin 1
said 1
the 1
dog 1
i 1
knew 1
how 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
your 1
irregular 1
life 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
the 1
ruin 1
of 1
you 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
work 1
steadily 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
and 1
get 1
your 1
food 1
regularly 1
given 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
no 1
objection 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
get 1
a 1
place 1
i 1
will 1
easily 1
arrange 1
that 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
dog 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
master 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
share 1
my 1
work 1
so 1
the 1
wolf 1
and 1
the 1
dog 1
went 1
towards 1
the 1
town 1
together 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
there 1
the 1
wolf 1
noticed 1
that 1
the 1
hair 1
on 1
a 1
certain 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
dog 1
s 1
neck 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
worn 1
away 1
so 1
he 1
asked 1
him 1
how 1
that 1
had 1
come 1
about 1
oh 1
it 1
is 1
nothing 1
said 1
the 1
dog 1
that 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
collar 1
is 1
put 1
on 1
at 1
night 1
to 1
keep 1
me 1
chained 1
up 1
it 1
chafes 1
a 1
bit 1
but 1
one 1
soon 1
gets 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
then 1
good 1
bye 1
to 1
you 1
master 1
dog 1
better 1
starve 1
free 1
than 1
be 1
a 1
fat 1
slave 1
the 1
belly 1
and 1
the 1
members 1
one 1
fine 1
day 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
the 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
doing 1
all 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
the 1
belly 1
was 1
having 1
all 1
the 1
food 1
so 1
they 1
held 1
a 1
meeting 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
discussion 1
decided 1
to 1
strike 1
work 1
till 1
the 1
belly 1
consented 1
to 1
take 1
its 1
proper 1
share 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
so 1
for 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
the 1
hands 1
refused 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
food 1
the 1
mouth 1
refused 1
to 1
receive 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
teeth 1
had 1
no 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
after 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
the 1
members 1
began 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
they 1
themselves 1
were 1
not 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
active 1
condition 1
the 1
hands 1
could 1
hardly 1
move 1
and 1
the 1
mouth 1
was 1
all 1
parched 1
and 1
dry 1
while 1
the 1
legs 1
were 1
unable 1
to 1
support 1
the 1
rest 1
so 1
thus 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
even 1
the 1
belly 1
in 1
its 1
dull 1
quiet 1
way 1
was 1
doing 1
necessary 1
work 1
for 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
that 1
all 1
must 1
work 1
together 1
or 1
the 1
body 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
pieces 1
the 1
hart 1
in 1
the 1
ox 1
stall 1
a 1
hart 1
hotly 1
pursued 1
by 1
the 1
hounds 1
fled 1
for 1
refuge 1
into 1
an 1
ox 1
stall 1
and 1
buried 1
itself 1
in 1
a 1
truss 1
of 1
hay 1
leaving 1
nothing 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
but 1
the 1
tips 1
of 1
his 1
horns 1
soon 1
after 1
the 1
hunters 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
asked 1
if 1
any 1
one 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
hart 1
the 1
stable 1
boys 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
resting 1
after 1
their 1
dinner 1
looked 1
round 1
but 1
could 1
see 1
nothing 1
and 1
the 1
hunters 1
went 1
away 1
shortly 1
afterwards 1
the 1
master 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
looking 1
round 1
saw 1
that 1
something 1
unusual 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
he 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
truss 1
of 1
hay 1
and 1
said 1
what 1
are 1
those 1
two 1
curious 1
things 1
sticking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
hay 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
stable 1
boys 1
came 1
to 1
look 1
they 1
discovered 1
the 1
hart 1
and 1
soon 1
made 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
thus 1
learnt 1
that 1
nothing 1
escapes 1
the 1
master 1
s 1
eye 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
grapes 1
one 1
hot 1
summer 1
s 1
day 1
a 1
fox 1
was 1
strolling 1
through 1
an 1
orchard 1
till 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
grapes 1
just 1
ripening 1
on 1
a 1
vine 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
trained 1
over 1
a 1
lofty 1
branch 1
just 1
the 1
thing 1
to 1
quench 1
my 1
thirst 1
quoth 1
he 1
drawing 1
back 1
a 1
few 1
paces 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
run 1
and 1
a 1
jump 1
and 1
just 1
missed 1
the 1
bunch 1
turning 1
round 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
one 1
two 1
three 1
he 1
jumped 1
up 1
but 1
with 1
no 1
greater 1
success 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
he 1
tried 1
after 1
the 1
tempting 1
morsel 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
had 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
walked 1
away 1
with 1
his 1
nose 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
saying 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
they 1
are 1
sour 1
it 1
is 1
easy 1
to 1
despise 1
what 1
you 1
cannot 1
get 1
the 1
horse 1
hunter 1
and 1
stag 1
a 1
quarrel 1
had 1
arisen 1
between 1
the 1
horse 1
and 1
the 1
stag 1
so 1
the 1
horse 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
hunter 1
to 1
ask 1
his 1
help 1
to 1
take 1
revenge 1
on 1
the 1
stag 1
the 1
hunter 1
agreed 1
but 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
desire 1
to 1
conquer 1
the 1
stag 1
you 1
must 1
permit 1
me 1
to 1
place 1
this 1
piece 1
of 1
iron 1
between 1
your 1
jaws 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
guide 1
you 1
with 1
these 1
reins 1
and 1
allow 1
this 1
saddle 1
to 1
be 1
placed 1
upon 1
your 1
back 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
keep 1
steady 1
upon 1
you 1
as 1
we 1
follow 1
after 1
the 1
enemy 1
the 1
horse 1
agreed 1
to 1
the 1
conditions 1
and 1
the 1
hunter 1
soon 1
saddled 1
and 1
bridled 1
him 1
then 1
with 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
the 1
hunter 1
the 1
horse 1
soon 1
overcame 1
the 1
stag 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
hunter 1
now 1
get 1
off 1
and 1
remove 1
those 1
things 1
from 1
my 1
mouth 1
and 1
back 1
not 1
so 1
fast 1
friend 1
said 1
the 1
hunter 1
i 1
have 1
now 1
got 1
you 1
under 1
bit 1
and 1
spur 1
and 1
prefer 1
to 1
keep 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
at 1
present 1
if 1
you 1
allow 1
men 1

the 1
peacock 1
and 1
juno 1
a 1
peacock 1
once 1
placed 1
a 1
petition 1
before 1
juno 1
desiring 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
a 1
nightingale 1
in 1
addition 1
to 1
his 1
other 1
attractions 1
but 1
juno 1
refused 1
his 1
request 1
when 1
he 1
persisted 1
and 1
pointed 1
out 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
her 1
favourite 1
bird 1
she 1
said 1
be 1
content 1
with 1
your 1
lot 1
one 1
cannot 1
be 1
first 1
in 1
everything 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
when 1
first 1
the 1
fox 1
saw 1
the 1
lion 1
he 1
was 1
terribly 1
frightened 1
and 1
ran 1
away 1
and 1
hid 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
next 1
time 1
however 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
beasts 1
he 1
stopped 1
at 1
a 1
safe 1
distance 1
and 1
watched 1
him 1
pass 1
by 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
they 1
came 1
near 1
one 1
another 1
the 1
fox 1
went 1
straight 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
passed 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
day 1
with 1
him 1
asking 1
him 1
how 1
his 1
family 1
were 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
seeing 1
him 1
again 1
then 1
turning 1
his 1
tail 1
he 1
parted 1
from 1
the 1
lion 1
without 1
much 1
ceremony 1
familiarity 1
breeds 1
contempt 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
the 1
statue 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
lion 1
were 1
discussing 1
the 1
relative 1
strength 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
lions 1
in 1
general 1
the 1
man 1
contended 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
fellows 1
were 1
stronger 1
than 1
lions 1
by 1
reason 1
of 1
their 1
greater 1
intelligence 1
come 1
now 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
cried 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
prove 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
right 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
public 1
gardens 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
a 1
statue 1
of 1
hercules 1
overcoming 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
tearing 1
his 1
mouth 1
in 1
two 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
the 1
lion 1
but 1
proves 1
nothing 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
made 1
the 1
statue 1
we 1
can 1
easily 1
represent 1
things 1
as 1
we 1
wish 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
ant 1
and 1
the 1
grasshopper 1
in 1
a 1
field 1
one 1
summer 1
s 1
day 1
a 1
grasshopper 1
was 1
hopping 1
about 1
chirping 1
and 1
singing 1
to 1
its 1
heart 1
s 1
content 1
an 1
ant 1
passed 1
by 1
bearing 1
along 1
with 1
great 1
toil 1
an 1
ear 1
of 1
corn 1
he 1
was 1
taking 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
why 1
not 1
come 1
and 1
chat 1
with 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
grasshopper 1
instead 1
of 1
toiling 1
and 1
moiling 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
i 1
am 1
helping 1
to 1
lay 1
up 1
food 1
for 1
the 1
winter 1
said 1
the 1
ant 1
and 1
recommend 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
why 1
bother 1
about 1
winter 1
said 1
the 1
grasshopper 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
plenty 1
of 1
food 1
at 1
present 1
but 1
the 1
ant 1
went 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
and 1
continued 1
its 1
toil 1
when 1
the 1
winter 1
came 1
the 1
grasshopper 1
had 1
no 1
food 1
and 1
found 1
itself 1
dying 1
of 1
hunger 1
while 1
it 1
saw 1
the 1
ants 1
distributing 1
every 1
day 1
corn 1
and 1
grain 1
from 1
the 1
stores 1
they 1
had 1
collected 1
in 1
the 1
summer 1
then 1
the 1
grasshopper 1
knew 1
it 1
is 1
best 1
to 1
prepare 1
for 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
necessity 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
the 1
reed 1
well 1
little 1
one 1
said 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
a 1
reed 1
that 1
was 1
growing 1
at 1
its 1
foot 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
plant 1
your 1
feet 1
deeply 1
in 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
raise 1
your 1
head 1
boldly 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
i 1
am 1
contented 1
with 1
my 1
lot 1
said 1
the 1
reed 1
i 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
grand 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
am 1
safer 1
safe 1
sneered 1
the 1
tree 1
who 1
shall 1
pluck 1
me 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
roots 1
or 1
bow 1
my 1
head 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
it 1
soon 1
had 1
to 1
repent 1
of 1
its 1
boasting 1
for 1
a 1
hurricane 1
arose 1
which 1
tore 1
it 1
up 1
from 1
its 1
roots 1
and 1
cast 1
it 1
a 1
useless 1
log 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
while 1
the 1
little 1
reed 1
bending 1
to 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
soon 1
stood 1
upright 1
again 1
when 1
the 1
storm 1
had 1
passed 1
over 1
obscurity 1
often 1
brings 1
safety 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
cat 1
a 1
fox 1
was 1
boasting 1
to 1
a 1
cat 1
of 1
its 1
clever 1
devices 1
for 1
escaping 1
its 1
enemies 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
whole 1
bag 1
of 1
tricks 1
he 1
said 1
which 1
contains 1
a 1
hundred 1
ways 1
of 1
escaping 1
my 1
enemies 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
one 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
generally 1
manage 1
with 1
that 1
just 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
they 1
heard 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
hounds 1
coming 1
towards 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
cat 1
immediately 1
scampered 1
up 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
hid 1
herself 1
in 1
the 1
boughs 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
plan 1
said 1
the 1
cat 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
fox 1
thought 1
first 1
of 1
one 1
way 1
then 1
of 1
another 1
and 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
debating 1
the 1
hounds 1
came 1
nearer 1
and 1
nearer 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
fox 1
in 1
his 1
confusion 1
was 1
caught 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
hounds 1
and 1
soon 1
killed 1
by 1
the 1
huntsmen 1
miss 1
puss 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
looking 1
on 1
said 1
better 1
one 1
safe 1
way 1
than 1
a 1
hundred 1
on 1
which 1
you 1
cannot 1
reckon 1
the 1
wolf 1
in 1
sheep 1
s 1
clothing 1
a 1
wolf 1
found 1
great 1
difficulty 1
in 1
getting 1
at 1
the 1
sheep 1
owing 1
to 1
the 1
vigilance 1
of 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
his 1
dogs 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
it 1
found 1
the 1
skin 1
of 1
a 1
sheep 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
flayed 1
and 1
thrown 1
aside 1
so 1
it 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
over 1
its 1
own 1
pelt 1
and 1
strolled 1
down 1
among 1
the 1
sheep 1
the 1
lamb 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
the 1
sheep 1
whose 1
skin 1
the 1
wolf 1
was 1
wearing 1
began 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
wolf 1
in 1
the 1
sheep 1
s 1
clothing 1
so 1
leading 1
the 1
lamb 1
a 1
little 1
apart 1
he 1
soon 1
made 1
a 1
meal 1
off 1
her 1
and 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
succeeded 1
in 1
deceiving 1
the 1
sheep 1
and 1
enjoying 1
hearty 1
meals 1
appearances 1
are 1
deceptive 1
the 1
dog 1
in 1
the 1
manger 1
a 1
dog 1
looking 1
out 1
for 1
its 1
afternoon 1
nap 1
jumped 1
into 1
the 1
manger 1
of 1
an 1
ox 1
and 1
lay 1
there 1
cosily 1
upon 1
the 1
straw 1
but 1
soon 1
the 1
ox 1
returning 1
from 1
its 1
afternoon 1
work 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
manger 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
eat 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
straw 1
the 1
dog 1
in 1
a 1
rage 1
being 1
awakened 1
from 1
its 1
slumber 1
stood 1
up 1
and 1
barked 1
at 1
the 1
ox 1
and 1
whenever 1
it 1
came 1
near 1
attempted 1
to 1
bite 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
ox 1
had 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
getting 1
at 1
the 1
straw 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
muttering 1
ah 1
people 1
often 1
grudge 1
others 1
what 1
they 1
cannot 1
enjoy 1
themselves 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
wooden 1
god 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
days 1
men 1
used 1
to 1
worship 1
sticks 1
and 1
stones 1
and 1
idols 1
and 1
prayed 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
luck 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
had 1
often 1
prayed 1
to 1
a 1
wooden 1
idol 1
he 1
had 1
received 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
but 1
his 1
luck 1
never 1
seemed 1
to 1
change 1
he 1
prayed 1
and 1
he 1
prayed 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
remained 1
as 1
unlucky 1
as 1
ever 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
rage 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
wooden 1
god 1
and 1
with 1
one 1
blow 1
swept 1
it 1
down 1
from 1
its 1
pedestal 1
the 1
idol 1
broke 1
in 1
two 1
and 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
see 1
an 1
immense 1
number 1
of 1
coins 1
flying 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
place 1
the 1
fisher 1
a 1
fisher 1
once 1
took 1
his 1
bagpipes 1
to 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
a 1
river 1
and 1
played 1
upon 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
making 1
the 1
fish 1
rise 1
but 1
never 1
a 1
one 1
put 1
his 1
nose 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
so 1
he 1
cast 1
his 1
net 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
soon 1
drew 1
it 1
forth 1
filled 1
with 1
fish 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
bagpipes 1
again 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
played 1
the 1
fish 1
leapt 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
net 1
ah 1
you 1
dance 1
now 1
when 1
i 1
play 1
said 1
he 1
yes 1
said 1
an 1
old 1
fish 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
power 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
as 1
he 1
bids 1
you 1
the 1
shepherd 1
s 1
boy 1
there 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
young 1
shepherd 1
boy 1
who 1
tended 1
his 1
sheep 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
a 1
mountain 1
near 1
a 1
dark 1
forest 1
it 1
was 1
rather 1
lonely 1
for 1
him 1
all 1
day 1
so 1
he 1
thought 1
upon 1
a 1
plan 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
a 1
little 1
company 1
and 1
some 1
excitement 1
he 1
rushed 1
down 1
towards 1
the 1
village 1
calling 1
out 1
wolf 1
wolf 1
and 1
the 1
villagers 1
came 1
out 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
stopped 1
with 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
considerable 1
time 1
this 1
pleased 1
the 1
boy 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
afterwards 1
he 1
tried 1
the 1
same 1
trick 1
and 1
again 1
the 1
villagers 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
help 1
but 1
shortly 1
after 1
this 1
a 1
wolf 1
actually 1
did 1
come 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
worry 1
the 1
sheep 1
and 1
the 1
boy 1
of 1
course 1
cried 1
out 1
wolf 1
wolf 1
still 1
louder 1
than 1
before 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
villagers 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
fooled 1
twice 1
before 1
thought 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
again 1
deceiving 1
them 1
and 1
nobody 1
stirred 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
his 1
help 1
so 1
the 1
wolf 1
made 1
a 1
good 1
meal 1
off 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
flock 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
boy 1
complained 1
the 1
wise 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
said 1
a 1
liar 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
believed 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
speaks 1
the 1
truth 1
the 1
young 1
thief 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
had 1
been 1
caught 1
in 1
a 1

of 1

execution 1
and 1
of 1
course 1

when 1
his 1

came 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
i 1

and 1
when 1
she 1
brought 1
her 1
ear 1
near 1
him 1
he 1
nearly 1
bit 1
it 1
off 1
all 1
the 1
bystanders 1
were 1
horrified 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
mean 1
by 1
such 1
brutal 1
and 1
inhuman 1
conduct 1
it 1
is 1
to 1

her 1
he 1
said 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
young 1
i 1
began 1
with 1
stealing 1
little 1
things 1
and 1
brought 1
them 1
home 1
to 1
mother 1
instead 1
of 1
rebuking 1
and 1
punishing 1
me 1
she 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
will 1
not 1

noticed 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
of 1
her 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
here 1
to 1
day 1
he 1
is 1
right 1
woman 1
said 1
the 1
priest 1
the 1
lord 1
hath 1
said 1
train 1
up 1
a 1
child 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
should 1
go 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
old 1
he 1
will 1
not 1
depart 1
therefrom 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
two 1
wives 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
days 1
when 1
men 1
were 1
allowed 1
to 1
have 1
many 1
wives 1
a 1
middle 1
aged 1
man 1
had 1
one 1
wife 1
that 1
was 1
old 1
and 1
one 1
that 1
was 1
young 1
each 1
loved 1
him 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
desired 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
like 1
herself 1
now 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
hair 1
was 1
turning 1
grey 1
which 1
the 1
young 1
wife 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
as 1
it 1
made 1
him 1
look 1
too 1
old 1
for 1
her 1
husband 1
so 1
every 1
night 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
comb 1
his 1
hair 1
and 1
pick 1
out 1
the 1
white 1
ones 1
but 1
the 1
elder 1
wife 1
saw 1
her 1
husband 1
growing 1
grey 1
with 1
great 1
pleasure 1
for 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
mistaken 1
for 1
his 1
mother 1
so 1
every 1
morning 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
arrange 1
his 1
hair 1
and 1
pick 1
out 1
as 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
ones 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
the 1
consequence 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
soon 1
found 1
himself 1
entirely 1
bald 1
yield 1
to 1
all 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
yield 1
the 1
nurse 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
be 1
quiet 1
now 1
said 1
an 1
old 1
nurse 1
to 1
a 1
child 1
sitting 1
on 1
her 1
lap 1
if 1
you 1
make 1
that 1
noise 1
again 1
i 1
will 1
throw 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
wolf 1
now 1
it 1
chanced 1
that 1
a 1
wolf 1
was 1
passing 1
close 1
under 1
the 1
window 1
as 1
this 1
was 1
said 1
so 1
he 1
crouched 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
waited 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
good 1
luck 1
to 1
day 1
thought 1
he 1
it 1
is 1
sure 1
to 1
cry 1
soon 1
and 1
a 1
daintier 1
morsel 1
i 1
haven 1
t 1
had 1
for 1
many 1
a 1
long 1
day 1
so 1
he 1
waited 1
and 1
he 1
waited 1
and 1
he 1
waited 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
child 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
the 1
wolf 1
came 1
forward 1
before 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
nurse 1
wagging 1
his 1
tail 1
but 1
all 1
the 1
nurse 1
did 1
was 1
to 1
shut 1
down 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
call 1
for 1
help 1
and 1
the 1
dogs 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
came 1
rushing 1
out 1
ah 1
said 1
the 1
wolf 1
as 1
he 1
galloped 1
away 1
enemies 1
promises 1
were 1
made 1
to 1
be 1
broken 1
the 1
tortoise 1
and 1
the 1
birds 1
a 1
tortoise 1
desired 1
to 1
change 1
its 1
place 1
of 1
residence 1
so 1
he 1
asked 1
an 1
eagle 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
new 1
home 1
promising 1
her 1
a 1
rich 1
reward 1
for 1
her 1
trouble 1
the 1
eagle 1
agreed 1
and 1
seizing 1
the 1
tortoise 1
by 1
the 1
shell 1
with 1
her 1
talons 1
soared 1
aloft 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
they 1
met 1
a 1
crow 1
who 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
eagle 1
tortoise 1
is 1
good 1
eating 1
the 1
shell 1
is 1
too 1
hard 1
said 1
the 1
eagle 1
in 1
reply 1
the 1
rocks 1
will 1
soon 1
crack 1
the 1
shell 1
was 1
the 1
crow 1
s 1
answer 1
and 1
the 1
eagle 1
taking 1
the 1
hint 1
let 1
fall 1
the 1
tortoise 1
on 1
a 1
sharp 1
rock 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
birds 1
made 1
a 1
hearty 1
meal 1
of 1
the 1
tortoise 1
never 1
soar 1
aloft 1
on 1
an 1
enemy 1
s 1
pinions 1
the 1
two 1
crabs 1
one 1
fine 1
day 1
two 1
crabs 1
came 1
out 1
from 1
their 1
home 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
stroll 1
on 1
the 1
sand 1
child 1
said 1
the 1
mother 1
you 1
are 1
walking 1
very 1
ungracefully 1
you 1
should 1
accustom 1
yourself 1
to 1
walking 1
straight 1
forward 1
without 1
twisting 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
pray 1
mother 1
said 1
the 1
young 1
one 1
do 1
but 1
set 1
the 1
example 1
yourself 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
follow 1
you 1
example 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
precept 1
the 1
ass 1
in 1
the 1
lion 1
s 1
skin 1
an 1
ass 1
once 1
found 1
a 1
lion 1
s 1
skin 1
which 1
the 1
hunters 1
had 1
left 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
to 1
dry 1
he 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
and 1
went 1
towards 1
his 1
native 1
village 1
all 1
fled 1
at 1
his 1
approach 1
both 1
men 1
and 1
animals 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
proud 1
ass 1
that 1
day 1
in 1
his 1
delight 1
he 1
lifted 1
up 1
his 1
voice 1
and 1
brayed 1
but 1
then 1
every 1
one 1
knew 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
owner 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
sound 1
cudgelling 1
for 1
the 1
fright 1
he 1
had 1
caused 1
and 1
shortly 1
afterwards 1
a 1
fox 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
ah 1
i 1
knew 1
you 1
by 1
your 1
voice 1
fine 1
clothes 1
may 1
disguise 1
but 1
silly 1
words 1
will 1
disclose 1
a 1
fool 1
the 1
two 1
fellows 1
and 1
the 1
bear 1
two 1
fellows 1
were 1
travelling 1
together 1
through 1
a 1
wood 1
when 1
a 1
bear 1
rushed 1
out 1
upon 1
them 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
travellers 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
he 1
seized 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
branch 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
hid 1
himself 1
among 1
the 1
leaves 1
the 1
other 1
seeing 1
no 1
help 1
for 1
it 1
threw 1
himself 1
flat 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
dust 1
the 1
bear 1
coming 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
put 1
his 1
muzzle 1
close 1
to 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
sniffed 1
and 1
sniffed 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
with 1
a 1
growl 1
he 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
slouched 1
off 1
for 1
bears 1
will 1
not 1
touch 1
dead 1
meat 1
then 1
the 1
fellow 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
comrade 1
and 1
laughing 1
said 1
what 1
was 1
it 1
that 1
master 1
bruin 1
whispered 1
to 1
you 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
never 1
trust 1
a 1
friend 1
who 1
deserts 1
you 1
at 1
a 1
pinch 1
the 1
two 1
pots 1
two 1
pots 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
a 1
river 1
one 1
of 1
brass 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
earthenware 1
when 1
the 1
tide 1
rose 1
they 1
both 1
floated 1
off 1
down 1
the 1
stream 1
now 1
the 1
earthenware 1
pot 1
tried 1
its 1
best 1
to 1
keep 1
aloof 1
from 1
the 1
brass 1
one 1
which 1
cried 1
out 1
fear 1
nothing 1
friend 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
strike 1
you 1
but 1
i 1
may 1
come 1
in 1
contact 1
with 1
you 1
said 1
the 1
other 1
if 1
i 1
come 1
too 1
close 1
and 1
whether 1
i 1
hit 1
you 1
or 1
you 1
hit 1
me 1
i 1
shall 1
suffer 1
for 1
it 1
the 1
strong 1
and 1
the 1
weak 1
cannot 1
keep 1
company 1
the 1
four 1
oxen 1
and 1
the 1
lion 1
a 1
lion 1
used 1
to 1
prowl 1
about 1
a 1
field 1
in 1
which 1
four 1
oxen 1
used 1
to 1
dwell 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
attack 1
them 1
but 1
whenever 1
he 1
came 1
near 1
they 1
turned 1
their 1
tails 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
so 1
that 1
whichever 1
way 1
he 1
approached 1
them 1
he 1
was 1
met 1
by 1
the 1
horns 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
they 1
fell 1
a 1
quarrelling 1
among 1
themselves 1
and 1
each 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
pasture 1
alone 1
in 1
a 1
separate 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
field 1
then 1
the 1
lion 1
attacked 1
them 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
and 1
soon 1
made 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
all 1
four 1
united 1
we 1
stand 1
divided 1
we 1
fall 1
the 1
fisher 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
fish 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
a 1
fisher 1
after 1
fishing 1
all 1
day 1
caught 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
fish 1
pray 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
master 1
said 1
the 1
fish 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
too 1
small 1
for 1
your 1
eating 1
just 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
put 1
me 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
i 1
shall 1
soon 1
grow 1
then 1
you 1
can 1
make 1
a 1
fine 1
meal 1
off 1
me 1
nay 1
nay 1
my 1
little 1
fish 1
said 1
the 1
fisher 1
i 1
have 1
you 1
now 1
i 1
may 1
not 1
catch 1
you 1
hereafter 1
a 1
little 1
thing 1
in 1
hand 1
is 1
worth 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
great 1
thing 1
in 1
prospect 1
avaricious 1
and 1
envious 1
two 1
neighbours 1
came 1
before 1
jupiter 1
and 1
prayed 1
him 1
to 1
grant 1
their 1
hearts 1
desire 1
now 1
the 1
one 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
avarice 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
eaten 1
up 1
with 1
envy 1
so 1
to 1
punish 1
them 1
both 1
jupiter 1
granted 1
that 1
each 1
might 1
have 1
whatever 1
he 1
wished 1
for 1
himself 1
but 1
only 1
on 1
condition 1
that 1
his 1
neighbour 1
had 1
twice 1
as 1
much 1
the 1
avaricious 1
man 1
prayed 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
room 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
no 1
sooner 1
said 1
than 1
done 1
but 1
all 1
his 1
joy 1
was 1
turned 1
to 1
grief 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
his 1
neighbour 1
had 1
two 1
rooms 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
precious 1
metal 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
turn 1
of 1
the 1
envious 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
his 1
neighbour 1
had 1
any 1
joy 1
at 1
all 1
so 1
he 1
prayed 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
eyes 1
put 1
out 1
by 1
which 1
means 1
his 1
companion 1
would 1
become 1
totally 1
blind 1
vices 1
are 1
their 1
own 1
punishment 1
the 1
crow 1
and 1
the 1
pitcher 1
a 1
crow 1
half 1
dead 1
with 1
thirst 1
came 1
upon 1
a 1
pitcher 1
which 1
had 1
once 1
been 1
full 1
of 1
water 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
crow 1
put 1
its 1
beak 1
into 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
pitcher 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
only 1
very 1
little 1
water 1
was 1
left 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
reach 1
far 1
enough 1
down 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
it 1
he 1
tried 1
and 1
he 1
tried 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
had 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
in 1
despair 1
then 1
a 1
thought 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
pebble 1
and 1
dropped 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
pitcher 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
another 1
pebble 1
and 1
dropped 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
pitcher 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
another 1
pebble 1
and 1
dropped 1
that 1
into 1
the 1
pitcher 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
another 1
pebble 1
and 1
dropped 1
that 1
into 1
the 1
pitcher 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
another 1
pebble 1
and 1
dropped 1
that 1
into 1
the 1
pitcher 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
another 1
pebble 1
and 1
dropped 1
that 1
into 1
the 1
pitcher 1
at 1
last 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
water 1
mount 1
up 1
near 1
him 1
and 1
after 1
casting 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
pebbles 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
quench 1
his 1
thirst 1
and 1
save 1
his 1
life 1
little 1
by 1
little 1
does 1
the 1
trick 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
satyr 1
a 1
man 1
had 1
lost 1
his 1
way 1
in 1
a 1
wood 1
one 1
bitter 1
winter 1
s 1
night 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
roaming 1
about 1
a 1
satyr 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
lost 1
his 1
way 1
promised 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
lodging 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
guide 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
along 1
to 1
the 1
satyr 1
s 1
cell 1
the 1
man 1
raised 1
both 1
his 1
hands 1
to 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
kept 1
on 1
blowing 1
at 1
them 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
do 1
that 1
for 1
said 1
the 1
satyr 1
my 1
hands 1
are 1
numb 1
with 1
the 1
cold 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
my 1
breath 1
warms 1
them 1
after 1
this 1
they 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
satyr 1
s 1
home 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
satyr 1
put 1
a 1
smoking 1
dish 1
of 1
porridge 1
before 1
him 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
man 1
raised 1
his 1
spoon 1
to 1
his 1
mouth 1
he 1
began 1
blowing 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
do 1
that 1
for 1
said 1
the 1
satyr 1
the 1
porridge 1
is 1
too 1
hot 1
and 1
my 1
breath 1
will 1
cool 1
it 1
out 1
you 1
go 1
said 1
the 1
satyr 1
i 1
will 1
have 1
nought 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
can 1
blow 1
hot 1
and 1
cold 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
breath 1
the 1
goose 1
with 1
the 1
golden 1
eggs 1
one 1
day 1
a 1
countryman 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
nest 1
of 1
his 1
goose 1
found 1
there 1
an 1
egg 1
all 1
yellow 1
and 1
glittering 1
when 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
heavy 1
as 1
lead 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
throw 1
it 1
away 1
because 1
he 1
thought 1
a 1
trick 1
had 1
been 1
played 1
upon 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
took 1
it 1
home 1
on 1
second 1
thoughts 1
and 1
soon 1
found 1
to 1
his 1
delight 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
egg 1
of 1
pure 1
gold 1
every 1
morning 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
occurred 1
and 1
he 1
soon 1
became 1
rich 1
by 1
selling 1
his 1
eggs 1
as 1
he 1
grew 1
rich 1
he 1
grew 1
greedy 1
and 1
thinking 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
once 1
all 1
the 1
gold 1
the 1
goose 1
could 1
give 1
he 1
killed 1
it 1
and 1
opened 1
it 1
only 1
to 1
find 1
nothing 1
greed 1
oft 1
o 1
er 1
reaches 1
itself 1
the 1
labourer 1
and 1
the 1
nightingale 1
a 1
labourer 1
lay 1
listening 1
to 1
a 1
nightingale 1
s 1
song 1
throughout 1
the 1
summer 1
night 1
so 1
pleased 1
was 1
he 1
with 1
it 1
that 1
the 1
next 1
night 1
he 1
set 1
a 1
trap 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
captured 1
it 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
caught 1
thee 1
he 1
cried 1
thou 1
shalt 1
always 1
sing 1
to 1
me 1
we 1
nightingales 1
never 1
sing 1
in 1
a 1
cage 1
said 1
the 1
bird 1
then 1
i 1
ll 1
eat 1
thee 1
said 1
the 1
labourer 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
heard 1
say 1
that 1
a 1
nightingale 1
on 1
toast 1
is 1
dainty 1
morsel 1
nay 1
kill 1
me 1
not 1
said 1
the 1
nightingale 1
but 1
let 1
me 1
free 1
and 1
i 1
ll 1
tell 1
thee 1
three 1
things 1
far 1
better 1
worth 1
than 1
my 1
poor 1
body 1
the 1
labourer 1
let 1
him 1
loose 1
and 1
he 1
flew 1
up 1
to 1
a 1
branch 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
said 1
never 1
believe 1
a 1
captive 1
s 1
promise 1
that 1
s 1
one 1
thing 1
then 1
again 1
keep 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
and 1
third 1
piece 1
of 1
advice 1
is 1
sorrow 1
not 1
over 1
what 1
is 1
lost 1
forever 1
then 1
the 1
song 1
bird 1
flew 1
away 1
the 1
fox 1
the 1
cock 1
and 1
the 1
dog 1
one 1
moonlight 1
night 1
a 1
fox 1
was 1
prowling 1
about 1
a 1
farmer 1
s 1
hen 1
coop 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
cock 1
roosting 1
high 1
up 1
beyond 1
his 1
reach 1
good 1
news 1
good 1
news 1
he 1
cried 1
why 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
cock 1
king 1
lion 1
has 1
declared 1
a 1
universal 1
truce 1
no 1
beast 1
may 1
hurt 1
a 1
bird 1
henceforth 1
but 1
all 1
shall 1
dwell 1
together 1
in 1
brotherly 1
friendship 1
why 1
that 1
is 1
good 1
news 1
said 1
the 1
cock 1
and 1
there 1
i 1
see 1
some 1
one 1
coming 1
with 1
whom 1
we 1
can 1
share 1
the 1
good 1
tidings 1
and 1
so 1
saying 1
he 1
craned 1
his 1
neck 1
forward 1
and 1
looked 1
afar 1
off 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
see 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
my 1
master 1
s 1
dog 1
that 1
is 1
coming 1
towards 1
us 1
what 1
going 1
so 1
soon 1
he 1
continued 1
as 1
the 1
fox 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
away 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
news 1
will 1
you 1
not 1
stop 1
and 1
congratulate 1
the 1
dog 1
on 1
the 1
reign 1
of 1
universal 1
peace 1
i 1
would 1
gladly 1
do 1
so 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
but 1
i 1
fear 1
he 1
may 1
not 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
king 1
lion 1
s 1
decree 1
cunning 1
often 1
outwits 1
itself 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
were 1
disputing 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
stronger 1
suddenly 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
traveller 1
coming 1
down 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
said 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
decide 1
our 1
dispute 1
whichever 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
cause 1
that 1
traveller 1
to 1
take 1
off 1
his 1
cloak 1
shall 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
the 1
stronger 1
you 1
begin 1
so 1
the 1
sun 1
retired 1
behind 1
a 1
cloud 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
began 1
to 1
blow 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
it 1
could 1
upon 1
the 1
traveller 1
but 1
the 1
harder 1
he 1
blew 1
the 1
more 1
closely 1
did 1
the 1
traveller 1
wrap 1
his 1
cloak 1
round 1
him 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
wind 1
had 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
in 1
despair 1
then 1
the 1
sun 1
came 1
out 1
and 1
shone 1
in 1
all 1
his 1
glory 1
upon 1
the 1
traveller 1
who 1
soon 1
found 1
it 1
too 1
hot 1
to 1
walk 1
with 1
his 1
cloak 1
on 1
kindness 1
effects 1
more 1
than 1
severity 1
hercules 1
and 1
the 1
waggoner 1
a 1
waggoner 1
was 1
once 1
driving 1
a 1
heavy 1
load 1
along 1
a 1
very 1
muddy 1
way 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
where 1
the 1
wheels 1
sank 1
half 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
mire 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
the 1
horses 1
pulled 1
the 1
deeper 1
sank 1
the 1
wheels 1
so 1
the 1
waggoner 1
threw 1
down 1
his 1
whip 1
and 1
knelt 1
down 1
and 1
prayed 1
to 1
hercules 1
the 1
strong 1
o 1
hercules 1
help 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
my 1
hour 1
of 1
distress 1
quoth 1
he 1
but 1
hercules 1
appeared 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
tut 1
man 1
don 1
t 1
sprawl 1
there 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
your 1
shoulder 1
to 1
the 1
wheel 1
the 1
gods 1
help 1
them 1
that 1
help 1
themselves 1
the 1
man 1
the 1
boy 1
and 1
the 1
donkey 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
son 1
were 1
once 1
going 1
with 1
their 1
donkey 1
to 1
market 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
walking 1
along 1
by 1
its 1
side 1
a 1
countryman 1
passed 1
them 1
and 1
said 1
you 1
fools 1
what 1
is 1
a 1
donkey 1
for 1
but 1
to 1
ride 1
upon 1
so 1
the 1
man 1
put 1
the 1
boy 1
on 1
the 1
donkey 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
but 1
soon 1
they 1
passed 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
men 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
said 1
see 1
that 1
lazy 1
youngster 1
he 1
lets 1
his 1
father 1
walk 1
while 1
he 1
rides 1
so 1
the 1
man 1
ordered 1
his 1
boy 1
to 1
get 1
off 1
and 1
got 1
on 1
himself 1
but 1
they 1
hadn 1
t 1
gone 1
far 1
when 1
they 1
passed 1
two 1
women 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
shame 1
on 1
that 1
lazy 1
lout 1
to 1
let 1
his 1
poor 1
little 1
son 1
trudge 1
along 1
well 1
the 1
man 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
boy 1
up 1
before 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
donkey 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
the 1
passers 1
by 1
began 1
to 1
jeer 1
and 1
point 1
at 1
them 1
the 1
man 1
stopped 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
scoffing 1
at 1
the 1
men 1
said 1
aren 1
t 1
you 1
ashamed 1
of 1
yourself 1
for 1
overloading 1
that 1
poor 1
donkey 1
of 1
yours 1
and 1
your 1
hulking 1
son 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
boy 1
got 1
off 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
think 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
they 1
thought 1
and 1
they 1
thought 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
cut 1
down 1
a 1
pole 1
tied 1
the 1
donkey 1
s 1
feet 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
raised 1
the 1
pole 1
and 1
the 1
donkey 1
to 1
their 1
shoulders 1
they 1
went 1
along 1
amid 1
the 1
laughter 1
of 1
all 1
who 1
met 1
them 1
till 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
market 1
bridge 1
when 1
the 1
donkey 1
getting 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
feet 1
loose 1
kicked 1
out 1
and 1
caused 1
the 1
boy 1
to 1
drop 1
his 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
pole 1
in 1
the 1
struggle 1
the 1
donkey 1
fell 1
over 1
the 1
bridge 1
and 1
his 1
fore 1
feet 1
being 1
tied 1
together 1
he 1
was 1
drowned 1
that 1
will 1
teach 1
you 1
said 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
who 1

followed 1

you 1
will 1

the 1
miser 1
and 1
his 1
gold 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
miser 1
who 1
used 1
to 1
hide 1
his 1
gold 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
in 1
his 1
garden 1
but 1
every 1
week 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
dig 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
gloat 1
over 1
his 1
gains 1
a 1
robber 1
who 1
had 1
noticed 1
this 1
went 1
and 1
dug 1
up 1
the 1
gold 1
and 1
decamped 1
with 1
it 1
when 1
the 1
miser 1
next 1
came 1
to 1
gloat 1
over 1
his 1
treasures 1
he 1
found 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
empty 1
hole 1
he 1
tore 1
his 1
hair 1
and 1
raised 1
such 1
an 1
outcry 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
neighbours 1
came 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
how 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
visit 1
his 1
gold 1
did 1
you 1
ever 1
take 1
any 1
of 1
it 1
out 1
asked 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
nay 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
only 1
came 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
then 1
come 1
again 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
hole 1
said 1
a 1
neighbour 1
it 1
will 1
do 1
you 1
just 1
as 1
much 1
good 1
wealth 1
unused 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
not 1
exist 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
mosquitoes 1
a 1
fox 1
after 1
crossing 1
a 1
river 1
got 1
its 1
tail 1
entangled 1
in 1
a 1
bush 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
mosquitoes 1
seeing 1
its 1
plight 1
settled 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
a 1
good 1
meal 1
undisturbed 1
by 1
its 1
tail 1
a 1
hedgehog 1
strolling 1
by 1
took 1
pity 1
upon 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
bad 1
way 1
neighbour 1
said 1
the 1
hedgehog 1
shall 1
i 1
relieve 1
you 1
by 1
driving 1
off 1
those 1
mosquitoes 1
who 1
are 1
sucking 1
your 1
blood 1
thank 1
you 1
master 1
hedgehog 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
but 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
not 1
why 1
how 1
is 1
that 1
asked 1
the 1
hedgehog 1
well 1
you 1
see 1
was 1
the 1
answer 1
these 1
mosquitoes 1
have 1
had 1
their 1
fill 1
if 1
you 1
drive 1
these 1
away 1
others 1
will 1
come 1
with 1
fresh 1
appetite 1
and 1
bleed 1
me 1
to 1
death 1
the 1
fox 1
without 1
a 1
tail 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
a 1
fox 1
caught 1
its 1
tail 1
in 1
a 1
trap 1
and 1
in 1
struggling 1
to 1
release 1
himself 1
lost 1
all 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
stump 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
was 1
ashamed 1
to 1
show 1
himself 1
among 1
his 1
fellow 1
foxes 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
put 1
a 1
bolder 1
face 1
upon 1
his 1
misfortune 1
and 1
summoned 1
all 1
the 1
foxes 1
to 1
a 1
general 1
meeting 1
to 1
consider 1
a 1
proposal 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
place 1
before 1
them 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
assembled 1
together 1
the 1
fox 1
proposed 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
all 1
do 1
away 1
with 1
their 1
tails 1
he 1
pointed 1
out 1
how 1
inconvenient 1
a 1
tail 1
was 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
pursued 1
by 1
their 1
enemies 1
the 1
dogs 1
how 1
much 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
when 1
they 1
desired 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
hold 1
a 1
friendly 1
conversation 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
he 1
failed 1
to 1
see 1
any 1
advantage 1
in 1
carrying 1
about 1
such 1
a 1
useless 1
encumbrance 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
said 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
older 1
foxes 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
recommended 1
us 1
to 1
dispense 1
with 1
our 1
chief 1
ornament 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
not 1
happened 1
to 1
lose 1
it 1
yourself 1
distrust 1
interested 1
advice 1
the 1
one 1
eyed 1
doe 1
a 1
doe 1
had 1
had 1
the 1
misfortune 1
to 1
lose 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
any 1
one 1
approaching 1
her 1
on 1
that 1
side 1
so 1
to 1
avoid 1
any 1
danger 1
she 1
always 1
used 1
to 1
feed 1
on 1
a 1
high 1
cliff 1
near 1
the 1
sea 1
with 1
her 1
sound 1
eye 1
looking 1
towards 1
the 1
land 1
by 1
this 1
means 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
whenever 1
the 1
hunters 1
approached 1
her 1
on 1
land 1
and 1
often 1
escaped 1
by 1
this 1
means 1
but 1
the 1
hunters 1
found 1
out 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
blind 1
of 1
one 1
eye 1
and 1
hiring 1
a 1
boat 1
rowed 1
under 1
the 1
cliff 1
where 1
she 1
used 1
to 1
feed 1
and 1
shot 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
sea 1
ah 1
cried 1
she 1
with 1
her 1
dying 1
voice 1
you 1
cannot 1
escape 1
your 1
fate 1
belling 1
the 1
cat 1
long 1
ago 1
the 1
mice 1
had 1
a 1
general 1
council 1
to 1
consider 1
what 1
measures 1
they 1
could 1
take 1
to 1
outwit 1
their 1
common 1
enemy 1
the 1
cat 1
some 1
said 1
this 1
and 1
some 1
said 1
that 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
a 1
young 1
mouse 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
proposal 1
to 1
make 1
which 1
he 1
thought 1
would 1
meet 1
the 1
case 1
you 1
will 1
all 1
agree 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
our 1
chief 1
danger 1
consists 1
in 1
the 1
sly 1
and 1
treacherous 1
manner 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
enemy 1
approaches 1
us 1
now 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
receive 1
some 1
signal 1
of 1
her 1
approach 1
we 1
could 1
easily 1
escape 1
from 1
her 1
i 1
venture 1
therefore 1
to 1
propose 1
that 1
a 1
small 1
bell 1
be 1
procured 1
and 1
attached 1
by 1
a 1
ribbon 1
round 1
the 1
neck 1
of 1
the 1
cat 1
by 1
this 1
means 1
we 1
should 1
always 1
know 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
about 1
and 1
could 1
easily 1
retire 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
this 1
proposal 1
met 1
with 1
general 1
applause 1
until 1
an 1
old 1
mouse 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
but 1
who 1
is 1
to 1
bell 1
the 1
cat 1
the 1
mice 1
looked 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
nobody 1
spoke 1
then 1
the 1
old 1
mouse 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
easy 1
to 1
propose 1
impossible 1
remedies 1
the 1
hare 1
and 1
the 1
tortoise 1
the 1
hare 1
was 1
once 1
boasting 1
of 1
his 1
speed 1
before 1
the 1
other 1
animals 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
yet 1
been 1
beaten 1
said 1
he 1
when 1
i 1
put 1
forth 1
my 1
full 1
speed 1
i 1
challenge 1
any 1
one 1
here 1
to 1
race 1
with 1
me 1
the 1
tortoise 1
said 1
quietly 1
i 1
accept 1
your 1
challenge 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
joke 1
said 1
the 1
hare 1
i 1
could 1
dance 1
round 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
keep 1
your 1
boasting 1
till 1
you 1
ve 1
beaten 1
answered 1
the 1
tortoise 1
shall 1
we 1
race 1
so 1
a 1
course 1
was 1
fixed 1
and 1
a 1
start 1
was 1
made 1
the 1
hare 1
darted 1
almost 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
soon 1
stopped 1
and 1
to 1
show 1
his 1
contempt 1
for 1
the 1
tortoise 1
lay 1
down 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
nap 1
the 1
tortoise 1
plodded 1
on 1
and 1
plodded 1
on 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
hare 1
awoke 1
from 1
his 1
nap 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
tortoise 1
just 1
near 1
the 1
winning 1
post 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
run 1
up 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
save 1
the 1
race 1
then 1
said 1
the 1
tortoise 1
plodding 1
wins 1
the 1
race 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
death 1
an 1
old 1
labourer 1
bent 1
double 1
with 1
age 1
and 1
toil 1
was 1
gathering 1
sticks 1
in 1
a 1
forest 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
grew 1
so 1
tired 1
and 1
hopeless 1
that 1
he 1
threw 1
down 1
the 1
bundle 1
of 1
sticks 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
i 1
cannot 1
bear 1
this 1
life 1
any 1
longer 1
ah 1
i 1
wish 1
death 1
would 1
only 1
come 1
and 1
take 1
me 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
death 1
a 1
grisly 1
skeleton 1
appeared 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
what 1
wouldst 1
thou 1
mortal 1
i 1
heard 1
thee 1
call 1
me 1
please 1
sir 1
replied 1
the 1
woodcutter 1
would 1
you 1
kindly 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
lift 1
this 1
faggot 1
of 1
sticks 1
on 1
to 1
my 1
shoulder 1
we 1
would 1
often 1
be 1
sorry 1
if 1
our 1
wishes 1
were 1
gratified 1
the 1
hare 1
with 1
many 1
friends 1
a 1
hare 1
was 1
very 1
popular 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
beasts 1
who 1
all 1
claimed 1
to 1
be 1
her 1
friends 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
she 1
heard 1
the 1
hounds 1
approaching 1
and 1
hoped 1
to 1
escape 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
her 1
many 1
friends 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
horse 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
carry 1
her 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
hounds 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
but 1
he 1
declined 1
stating 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
important 1
work 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
felt 1
sure 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
all 1
her 1
other 1
friends 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
her 1
assistance 1
she 1
then 1
applied 1
to 1
the 1
bull 1
and 1
hoped 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
repel 1
the 1
hounds 1
with 1
his 1
horns 1
the 1
bull 1
replied 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
sorry 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
an 1
appointment 1
with 1
a 1
lady 1
but 1
i 1
feel 1
sure 1
that 1
our 1
friend 1
the 1
goat 1
will 1
do 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
the 1
goat 1
however 1
feared 1
that 1
his 1
back 1
might 1
do 1
her 1
some 1
harm 1
if 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
upon 1
it 1
the 1
ram 1
he 1
felt 1
sure 1
was 1
the 1
proper 1
friend 1
to 1
apply 1
to 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
ram 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
case 1
the 1
ram 1
replied 1
another 1
time 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
interfere 1
on 1
the 1
present 1
occasion 1
as 1
hounds 1
have 1
been 1
known 1
to 1
eat 1
sheep 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
hares 1
the 1
hare 1
then 1
applied 1
as 1
a 1
last 1
hope 1
to 1
the 1
calf 1
who 1
regretted 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
help 1
her 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
responsibility 1
upon 1
himself 1
as 1
so 1
many 1
older 1
persons 1
than 1
himself 1
had 1
declined 1
the 1
task 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
hounds 1
were 1
quite 1
near 1
and 1
the 1
hare 1
took 1
to 1
her 1
heels 1
and 1
luckily 1
escaped 1
he 1
that 1
has 1
many 1
friends 1
has 1
no 1
friends 1
the 1
lion 1
in 1
love 1
a 1
lion 1
once 1
fell 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
a 1
beautiful 1
maiden 1
and 1
proposed 1
marriage 1
to 1
her 1
parents 1
the 1
old 1
people 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
give 1
their 1
daughter 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
yet 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
enrage 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
beasts 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
father 1
said 1
we 1
feel 1
highly 1
honoured 1
by 1
your 1
majesty 1
s 1
proposal 1
but 1
you 1
see 1
our 1
daughter 1
is 1
a 1
tender 1
young 1
thing 1
and 1
we 1
fear 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
vehemence 1
of 1
your 1
affection 1
you 1
might 1
possibly 1
do 1
her 1
some 1
injury 1
might 1
i 1
venture 1
to 1
suggest 1
that 1
your 1
majesty 1
should 1
have 1
your 1
claws 1
removed 1
and 1
your 1
teeth 1
extracted 1
then 1
we 1
would 1
gladly 1
consider 1
your 1
proposal 1
again 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
in 1
love 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
his 1
claws 1
trimmed 1
and 1
his 1
big 1
teeth 1
taken 1
out 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
again 1
to 1
the 1
parents 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
girl 1
they 1
simply 1
laughed 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
bade 1
him 1
do 1
his 1
worst 1
love 1
can 1
tame 1
the 1
wildest 1
the 1
bundle 1
of 1
sticks 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
death 1
summoned 1
his 1
sons 1
around 1
him 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
some 1
parting 1
advice 1
he 1
ordered 1
his 1
servants 1
to 1
bring 1
in 1
a 1
faggot 1
of 1
sticks 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
eldest 1
son 1
break 1
it 1
the 1
son 1
strained 1
and 1
strained 1
but 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
efforts 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
break 1
the 1
bundle 1
the 1
other 1
sons 1
also 1
tried 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
successful 1
untie 1
the 1
faggots 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
and 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
take 1
a 1
stick 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
done 1
so 1
he 1
called 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
now 1
break 1
and 1
each 1
stick 1
was 1
easily 1
broken 1
you 1
see 1
my 1
meaning 1
said 1
their 1
father 1
union 1
gives 1
strength 1
the 1
lion 1
the 1
fox 1
and 1
the 1
beasts 1
the 1
lion 1
once 1
gave 1
out 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
sick 1
unto 1
death 1
and 1
summoned 1
the 1
animals 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
hear 1
his 1
last 1
will 1
and 1
testament 1
so 1
the 1
goat 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
lion 1
s 1
cave 1
and 1
stopped 1
there 1
listening 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
then 1
a 1
sheep 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
before 1
she 1
came 1
out 1
a 1
calf 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
receive 1
the 1
last 1
wishes 1
of 1
the 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
beasts 1
but 1
soon 1
the 1
lion 1
seemed 1
to 1
recover 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
his 1
cave 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
fox 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
waiting 1
outside 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
pay 1
your 1
respects 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
the 1
lion 1
to 1
the 1
fox 1
i 1
beg 1
your 1
majesty 1
s 1
pardon 1
said 1
the 1
fox 1
but 1
i 1
noticed 1
the 1
track 1
of 1
the 1
animals 1
that 1
have 1
already 1
come 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
see 1
many 1
hoof 1
marks 1
going 1
in 1
i 1
see 1
none 1
coming 1
out 1
till 1
the 1
animals 1
that 1
have 1
entered 1
your 1
cave 1
come 1
out 1
again 1
i 1
prefer 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
it 1
is 1
easier 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
the 1
enemy 1
s 1
toils 1
than 1
out 1
again 1
the 1
ass 1
s 1
brains 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
the 1
fox 1
went 1
hunting 1
together 1
the 1
lion 1
on 1
the 1
advice 1
of 1
the 1
fox 1
sent 1
a 1
message 1
to 1
the 1
ass 1
proposing 1
to 1
make 1
an 1
alliance 1
between 1
their 1
two 1
families 1
the 1
ass 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
meeting 1
overjoyed 1
at 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
a 1
royal 1
alliance 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
there 1
the 1
lion 1
simply 1
pounced 1
on 1
the 1
ass 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
fox 1
here 1
is 1
our 1
dinner 1
for 1
to 1
day 1
watch 1
you 1
here 1
while 1
i 1
go 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
nap 1
woe 1
betide 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
touch 1
my 1
prey 1
the 1
lion 1
went 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
fox 1
waited 1
but 1
finding 1
that 1
his 1
master 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
ventured 1
to 1
take 1
out 1
the 1
brains 1
of 1
the 1
ass 1
and 1
ate 1
them 1
up 1
when 1
the 1
lion 1
came 1
back 1
he 1
soon 1
noticed 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
the 1
brains 1
and 1
asked 1
the 1
fox 1
in 1
a 1
terrible 1
voice 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
done 1
with 1
the 1
brains 1
brains 1
your 1
majesty 1
it 1
had 1
none 1
or 1
it 1
would 1
never 1
have 1
fallen 1
into 1
your 1
trap 1
wit 1
has 1
always 1
an 1
answer 1
ready 1
the 1
eagle 1
and 1
the 1
arrow 1
an 1
eagle 1
was 1
soaring 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
when 1
suddenly 1
it 1
heard 1
the 1
whizz 1
of 1
an 1
arrow 1
and 1
felt 1
itself 1
wounded 1
to 1
death 1
slowly 1
it 1
fluttered 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
with 1
its 1
life 1
blood 1
pouring 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
looking 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
arrow 1
with 1
which 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
pierced 1
it 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
shaft 1
of 1
the 1
arrow 1
had 1
been 1
feathered 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
plumes 1
alas 1
it 1
cried 1

possible 1
for 1
a 1
living 1
being 1
to 1
change 1
its 1
nature 1
jupiter 1
said 1
yes 1
but 1
venus 1
said 1
no 1

to 1

the 1
question 1
jupiter 1
turned 1
a 1
cat 1
into 1
a 1
maiden 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
to 1
a 1

her 1

into 1
the 1
room 1
no 1
sooner 1

the 1
bride 1
see 1
this 1
than 1
she 1
jumped 1
up 1
from 1
her 1
seat 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
pounce 1
upon 1
the 1
mouse 1
ah 1
you 1
see 1
said 1
venus 1

the 1
horse 1
and 1
the 1
ass 1
a 1
horse 1
and 1
an 1
ass 1
were 1
travelling 1
together 1
the 1
horse 1
prancing 1
along 1
in 1
its 1
fine 1
trappings 1
the 1
ass 1
carrying 1
with 1
difficulty 1
the 1
heavy 1
weight 1
in 1
its 1
panniers 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
were 1
you 1
sighed 1
the 1
ass 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
well 1
fed 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
fine 1
harness 1
upon 1
you 1
next 1
day 1
however 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
battle 1
and 1
the 1
horse 1
was 1
wounded 1
to 1
death 1
in 1
the 1
final 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
his 1
friend 1
the 1
ass 1
happened 1
to 1
pass 1
by 1
shortly 1
afterwards 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
death 1
i 1
was 1
wrong 1
said 1
the 1
ass 1
better 1
humble 1
security 1
than 1
gilded 1
danger 1
the 1
trumpeter 1
taken 1
prisoner 1
a 1
trumpeter 1
during 1
a 1
battle 1
ventured 1
too 1
near 1
the 1
enemy 1
and 1
was 1
captured 1
by 1
them 1
they 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
proceed 1
to 1
put 1
him 1
to 1
death 1
when 1
he 1
begged 1
them 1
to 1
hear 1
his 1
plea 1
for 1
mercy 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
fight 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
indeed 1
carry 1
no 1
weapon 1
i 1
only 1
blow 1
this 1
trumpet 1
and 1
surely 1
that 1
cannot 1
harm 1
you 1
then 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
kill 1
me 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
fight 1
yourself 1
said 1
the 1
others 1
but 1
you 1
encourage 1
and 1
guide 1
your 1
men 1
to 1
the 1
fight 1

may 1
be 1

the 1
buffoon 1
and 1
the 1
countryman 1
at 1
a 1
country 1
fair 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
buffoon 1
who 1
made 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
laugh 1
by 1
imitating 1
the 1
cries 1
of 1
various 1
animals 1
he 1
finished 1
off 1
by 1
squeaking 1
so 1
like 1
a 1
pig 1
that 1
the 1
spectators 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
porker 1
concealed 1
about 1
him 1
but 1
a 1
countryman 1
who 1
stood 1
by 1
said 1
call 1
that 1
a 1
pig 1
s 1
squeak 1
nothing 1
like 1
it 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
till 1
tomorrow 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
what 1
it 1
s 1
like 1
the 1
audience 1
laughed 1
but 1
next 1
day 1
sure 1
enough 1
the 1
countryman 1
appeared 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
putting 1
his 1
head 1
down 1
squealed 1
so 1
hideously 1
that 1
the 1
spectators 1
hissed 1
and 1
threw 1
stones 1
at 1
him 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
stop 1
you 1
fools 1
he 1
cried 1
see 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
hissing 1
and 1
held 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
pig 1
whose 1
ear 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
pinching 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
utter 1
the 1
squeals 1
men 1
often 1
applaud 1
an 1
imitation 1
and 1
hiss 1
the 1
real 1
thing 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
and 1
the 1
wine 1
jar 1
you 1
must 1
know 1
that 1
sometimes 1
old 1
women 1
like 1
a 1
glass 1

he 1
was 1
doing 1
down 1
there 1

according 1
to 1
the 1
study 1
public 1
librarians 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1

had 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1

its 1

net 1
for 1
the 1
electronic 1
poor 1
on 1
the 1

felt 1
that 1

could 1
not 1

better 1
what 1

were 1

might 1

lack 1
thereof 1
for 1

the 1
study 1
describes 1
several 1
scenarios 1
for 1
public 1
libraries 1
as 1
the 1
nren 1
evolves 1
some 1
may 1
simply 1
choose 1
to 1
ignore 1
the 1
sweeping 1
technological 1
changes 1
in 1
information 1
transfer 1
they 1
may 1
continue 1
to 1
exist 1
by 1
purveying 1
high 1
demand 1
items 1
and 1
traditional 1
services 1
but 1
they 1
may 1
find 1
it 1
increasingly 1
difficult 1
to 1
maintain 1
funding 1
levels 1
as 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
looks 1
elsewhere 1
for 1
their 1
information 1
and 1
reference 1
needs 1
the 1
public 1
library 1
may 1
find 1
itself 1
servicing 1
only 1
the 1
information 1
disenfranchised 1
while 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
community 1
finds 1
and 1
pays 1
for 1
other 1
solutions 1
as 1
the 1
study 1
explains 1
while 1
embracing 1
and 1
exploiting 1
networked 1
information 1
and 1
services 1
successfully 1
transitioned 1
libraries 1
also 1
maintain 1
high 1
visibility 1
and 1
high 1
demand 1
traditional 1
services 1
but 1
resources 1
will 1
be 1
reallocated 1
from 1
collections 1
and 1
less 1
visible 1
services 1
to 1
support 1
their 1
involvement 1
in 1
the 1
network 1
all 1
services 1
will 1
be 1
more 1
client 1
centered 1
and 1
demand 1
based 1
and 1
the 1
library 1
will 1
consciously 1
seek 1
opportunities 1
to 1
deliver 1
new 1
types 1
of 1
information 1
resources 1
and 1
services 1
electronically 1
in 1
this 1
scenario 1
the 1
public 1
library 1
will 1
develop 1
and 1
mount 1
services 1
over 1
the 1
nren 1
provide 1
for 1
public 1
access 1
to 1
the 1
nren 1
and 1
will 1
compete 1
successfully 1
against 1
other 1
information 1
providers 1
in 1
its 1
networked 1
role 1
the 1
library 1
can 1
serve 1
as 1
a 1
central 1
point 1
of 1
contact 1
as 1
an 1
electronic 1

regardless 1
of 1

or 1
physical 1
location 1
the 1
public 1
library 1
in 1
this 1
second 1
scenario 1
will 1
define 1
a 1

for 1
itself 1
in 1
the 1
nren 1

with 1
little 1

aladdin 1
did 1
not 1

ways 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
playing 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
as 1
usual 1
a 1
stranger 1
asked 1
him 1
his 1
age 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
mustapha 1
the 1
tailor 1
i 1

replied 1
aladdin 1
but 1
he 1
died 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
ago 1
on 1
this 1
the 1
stranger 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
famous 1
african 1
magician 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
kissed 1
him 1
saying 1
i 1
am 1
your 1
uncle 1
and 1
knew 1
you 1
from 1
your 1

her 1
i 1

aladdin 1
ran 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
his 1
mother 1
of 1
his 1
newly 1
found 1
uncle 1
indeed 1
child 1
she 1
said 1
your 1
father 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
but 1
i 1
always 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
however 1
she 1
prepared 1
supper 1
and 1
bade 1
aladdin 1
seek 1
his 1
uncle 1
who 1
came 1
laden 1
with 1
wine 1
and 1
fruit 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
kissed 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
mustapha 1
used 1
to 1
sit 1
bidding 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
surprised 1
at 1
not 1
having 1
seen 1
him 1
before 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forty 1
years 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
he 1
then 1
turned 1
to 1
aladdin 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
his 1
trade 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
boy 1
hung 1
his 1
head 1
while 1
his 1
mother 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
on 1
learning 1
that 1
aladdin 1
was 1
idle 1
and 1
would 1
learn 1
no 1
trade 1
he 1
offered 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
shop 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
stock 1
it 1
with 1
merchandise 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
bought 1
aladdin 1
a 1
fine 1
suit 1
of 1
clothes 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
city 1
showing 1
him 1
the 1
sights 1
and 1
brought 1
him 1
home 1
at 1
nightfall 1
to 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
son 1
so 1
fine 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
magician 1
led 1
aladdin 1
into 1
some 1
beautiful 1
gardens 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
outside 1
the 1
city 1
gates 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
a 1
fountain 1
and 1
the 1
magician 1
pulled 1
a 1
cake 1
from 1
his 1
girdle 1
which 1
he 1
divided 1
between 1
them 1
then 1
they 1
journeyed 1
onwards 1
till 1
they 1
almost 1
reached 1
the 1
mountains 1
aladdin 1
was 1
so 1
tired 1
that 1
he 1
begged 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
but 1
the 1
magician 1
beguiled 1
him 1
with 1
pleasant 1
stories 1
and 1
lead 1
him 1
on 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
two 1
mountains 1
divided 1
by 1
a 1
narrow 1
valley 1
we 1
will 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
said 1
his 1
uncle 1
i 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
something 1
wonderful 1
only 1
do 1
you 1
gather 1
up 1
sticks 1
while 1
i 1
kindle 1
a 1
fire 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
lit 1
the 1
magician 1
threw 1
on 1
it 1
a 1
powder 1
he 1
had 1
about 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
saying 1
some 1
magical 1
words 1
the 1
earth 1
trembled 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
disclosing 1
a 1
square 1
flat 1
stone 1
with 1
a 1
brass 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
to 1
raise 1
it 1
by 1
aladdin 1
tried 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
the 1
magician 1
caught 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
blow 1
that 1
knocked 1
him 1
down 1
what 1
have 1
i 1
done 1
uncle 1
he 1
said 1
piteously 1
whereupon 1
the 1
magician 1
said 1
more 1
kindly 1
fear 1
nothing 1
but 1
obey 1
me 1
beneath 1
this 1
stone 1
lies 1
a 1
treasure 1
which 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
yours 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
may 1
touch 1
it 1
so 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
exactly 1
as 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
at 1
the 1
word 1
treasure 1
aladdin 1
forgot 1
his 1
fears 1
and 1
grasped 1
the 1
ring 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
saying 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
grandfather 1
the 1
stone 1
came 1
up 1
quite 1
easily 1
and 1
some 1
steps 1
appeared 1
go 1
down 1
said 1
the 1
magician 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
those 1
steps 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
an 1
open 1
door 1
leading 1
into 1
three 1
large 1
halls 1
tuck 1
up 1
your 1
gown 1
and 1
go 1
through 1
them 1
without 1
touching 1
anything 1
or 1
you 1
will 1
die 1
instantly 1
these 1
halls 1
lead 1
into 1
a 1
garden 1
of 1
fine 1
fruit 1
trees 1
walk 1
on 1
till 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
niche 1
in 1
a 1
terrace 1
where 1
stands 1
a 1
lighted 1
lamp 1
pour 1
out 1
the 1
oil 1
it 1
contains 1
and 1
bring 1
it 1
me 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
ring 1
from 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
aladdin 1
bidding 1
him 1
prosper 1
aladdin 1
found 1
everything 1
as 1
the 1
magician 1
had 1
said 1
gathered 1
some 1
fruit 1
off 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
having 1
got 1
the 1
lamp 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
the 1
magician 1
cried 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
hurry 1
make 1
haste 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
lamp 1
this 1
aladdin 1
refused 1
to 1
do 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
the 1
magician 1
flew 1
into 1
a 1
terrible 1
passion 1
and 1
throwing 1
some 1
more 1
powder 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
he 1
said 1
something 1
and 1
the 1
stone 1
rolled 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
place 1
the 1
man 1
left 1
the 1
country 1
which 1
plainly 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
uncle 1
of 1
aladdin 1
s 1
but 1
a 1
cunning 1
magician 1
who 1
had 1
read 1
in 1
his 1
magic 1
books 1
of 1
a 1
wonderful 1
lamp 1
which 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
the 1
most 1
powerful 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
though 1
he 1
alone 1
knew 1
where 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
receive 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
another 1
he 1
had 1
picked 1
out 1
the 1
foolish 1
aladdin 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
intending 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
afterwards 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
aladdin 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
crying 1
and 1
lamenting 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
clasped 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
prayer 1
and 1
in 1
so 1
doing 1
rubbed 1
the 1
ring 1
which 1
the 1
magician 1
had 1
forgotten 1
to 1
take 1
from 1
him 1
immediately 1
an 1
enormous 1
and 1
frightful 1
genie 1
rose 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
saying 1
what 1
wouldst 1
thou 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
the 1
ring 1
and 1
will 1
obey 1
thee 1
in 1
all 1
things 1
aladdin 1
fearlessly 1
replied 1
deliver 1
me 1
from 1
this 1
place 1
whereupon 1
the 1
earth 1
opened 1
and 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
outside 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
his 1
eyes 1
could 1
bear 1
the 1
light 1
he 1
went 1
home 1
but 1
fainted 1
on 1
the 1
threshold 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
himself 1
he 1
told 1
his 1
mother 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
and 1
showed 1
her 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
the 1
fruits 1
he 1
had 1
gathered 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
which 1
were 1
in 1
reality 1
precious 1
stones 1
he 1
then 1
asked 1
for 1
some 1
food 1
alas 1
child 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
spun 1
a 1
little 1
cotton 1
and 1
will 1
go 1
sell 1
it 1
aladdin 1
bade 1
her 1
keep 1
her 1
cotton 1
for 1
he 1
would 1
sell 1
the 1
lamp 1
instead 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
dirty 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
rub 1
it 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
fetch 1
a 1
higher 1
price 1
instantly 1
a 1
hideous 1
genie 1
appeared 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
she 1
fainted 1
away 1
but 1
aladdin 1
snatching 1
the 1
lamp 1
said 1
boldly 1
fetch 1
me 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
genie 1
returned 1
with 1
a 1
silver 1
bowl 1
twelve 1
silver 1
plates 1
containing 1
rich 1
meats 1
two 1
silver 1
cups 1
and 1
two 1
bottles 1
of 1
wine 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
herself 1
said 1
whence 1
comes 1
this 1
splendid 1
feast 1
ask 1
not 1
but 1
eat 1
replied 1
aladdin 1
so 1
they 1
sat 1
at 1
breakfast 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
dinner 1
time 1
and 1
aladdin 1
told 1
his 1
mother 1
about 1
the 1
lamp 1
she 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
sell 1
it 1
and 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
devils 1
no 1
said 1
aladdin 1
since 1
chance 1
hath 1
made 1
us 1
aware 1
of 1
its 1
virtues 1
we 1
will 1
use 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
ring 1
likewise 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
always 1
wear 1
on 1
my 1
finger 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
all 1
the 1
genie 1
had 1
brought 1
aladdin 1
sold 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
silver 1
plates 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
until 1
none 1
were 1
left 1
he 1
then 1
had 1
recourse 1
to 1
the 1
genie 1
who 1
gave 1
him 1
another 1
set 1
of 1
plates 1
and 1
thus 1
they 1
lived 1
many 1
years 1
one 1
day 1
aladdin 1
heard 1
an 1
order 1
from 1
the 1
sultan 1
proclaimed 1
that 1
everyone 1
was 1
to 1
stay 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
close 1
his 1
shutters 1
while 1
the 1
princess 1
his 1
daughter 1
went 1
to 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
bath 1
aladdin 1
was 1
seized 1
by 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
face 1
which 1
was 1
very 1
difficult 1
as 1
she 1
always 1
went 1
veiled 1
he 1
hid 1
himself 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
bath 1
and 1
peeped 1
through 1
a 1
chink 1
the 1
princess 1
lifted 1
her 1
veil 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
looked 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
aladdin 1
fell 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
her 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
he 1
went 1
home 1
so 1
changed 1
that 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
frightened 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
he 1
loved 1
the 1
princess 1
so 1
deeply 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
without 1
her 1
and 1
meant 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
in 1
marriage 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
his 1
mother 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
burst 1
out 1
laughing 1
but 1
aladdin 1
at 1
last 1
prevailed 1
upon 1
her 1
to 1
go 1
before 1
the 1
sultan 1
and 1
carry 1
his 1
request 1
she 1
fetched 1
a 1
napkin 1
and 1
laid 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
magic 1
fruits 1
from 1
the 1
enchanted 1
garden 1
which 1
sparkled 1
and 1
shone 1
like 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
jewels 1
she 1
took 1
these 1
with 1
her 1
to 1
please 1
the 1
sultan 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
trusting 1
in 1
the 1
lamp 1
the 1
grand 1
vizier 1
and 1
the 1
lords 1
of 1
council 1
had 1
just 1
gone 1
in 1
as 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
placed 1
herself 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
sultan 1
he 1
however 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
her 1
she 1
went 1
every 1
day 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
when 1
the 1
council 1
broke 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
sixth 1
day 1
the 1
sultan 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
vizier 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
certain 1
woman 1
in 1
the 1
audience 1
chamber 1
every 1
day 1
carrying 1
something 1
in 1
a 1
napkin 1
call 1
her 1
next 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
she 1
wants 1
next 1
day 1
at 1
a 1
sign 1
from 1
the 1
vizier 1
she 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
throne 1
and 1
remained 1
kneeling 1
until 1
the 1
sultan 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
rise 1
good 1
woman 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
she 1
hesitated 1
so 1
the 1
sultan 1
sent 1
away 1
all 1
but 1
the 1
vizier 1
and 1
bade 1
her 1
speak 1
freely 1
promising 1
to 1
forgive 1
her 1
beforehand 1
for 1
anything 1
she 1
might 1
say 1
she 1
then 1
told 1
him 1
of 1
her 1
son 1
s 1
violent 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
princess 1
i 1
prayed 1
him 1
to 1
forget 1
her 1
she 1
said 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
he 1
threatened 1
to 1
do 1
some 1
desperate 1
deed 1
if 1
i 1
refused 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
ask 1
your 1
majesty 1
for 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
now 1
i 1
pray 1
you 1
to 1
forgive 1
not 1
me 1
alone 1
but 1
my 1
son 1
aladdin 1
the 1
sultan 1
asked 1
her 1
kindly 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
napkin 1
whereupon 1
she 1
unfolded 1
the 1
jewels 1
and 1
presented 1
them 1
he 1
was 1
thunderstruck 1
and 1
turning 1
to 1
the 1
vizier 1
said 1
what 1
sayest 1
thou 1
ought 1
i 1
not 1
to 1
bestow 1
the 1
princess 1
on 1
one 1
who 1
values 1
her 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
price 1
the 1
vizier 1
who 1
wanted 1
her 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
son 1
begged 1
the 1
sultan 1
to 1
withhold 1
her 1
for 1
three 1
months 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
hoped 1
his 1
son 1
could 1
contrive 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
a 1
richer 1
present 1
the 1
sultan 1
granted 1
this 1
and 1
told 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
that 1
though 1
he 1
consented 1
to 1
the 1
marriage 1
she 1
must 1
not 1
appear 1
before 1
him 1
again 1
for 1
three 1
months 1
aladdin 1
waited 1
patiently 1
for 1
nearly 1
three 1
months 1
but 1
after 1
two 1
had 1
elapsed 1
his 1
mother 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
city 1
to 1
buy 1
oil 1
found 1
everyone 1
rejoicing 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
know 1
was 1
the 1
answer 1
that 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
grand 1
vizier 1
is 1
to 1
marry 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
daughter 1
tonight 1
breathless 1
she 1
ran 1
and 1
told 1
aladdin 1
who 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
presently 1
bethought 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
he 1
rubbed 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
genie 1
appeared 1
saying 1
what 1
is 1
thy 1
will 1
aladdin 1
replied 1
the 1
sultan 1
as 1
thou 1
knowest 1
has 1
broken 1
his 1
promise 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
is 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
princess 1
my 1
command 1
is 1
that 1
to 1
night 1
you 1
bring 1
hither 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
bridegroom 1
master 1
i 1
obey 1
said 1
the 1
genie 1
aladdin 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
chamber 1
where 1
sure 1
enough 1
at 1
midnight 1
the 1
genie 1
transported 1
the 1
bed 1
containing 1
the 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
take 1
this 1
new 1
married 1
man 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
outside 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
and 1
return 1
at 1
daybreak 1
whereupon 1
the 1
genie 1
took 1
the 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
leaving 1
aladdin 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
fear 1
nothing 1
aladdin 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
wife 1
promised 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
your 1
unjust 1
father 1
and 1
no 1
harm 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
too 1
frightened 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
passed 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
night 1
of 1
her 1
life 1
while 1
aladdin 1
lay 1
down 1
beside 1
her 1
and 1
slept 1
soundly 1
at 1
the 1
appointed 1
hour 1
the 1
genie 1
fetched 1
in 1
the 1
shivering 1
bridegroom 1
laid 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
place 1
and 1
transported 1
the 1
bed 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
presently 1
the 1
sultan 1
came 1
to 1
wish 1
his 1
daughter 1
good 1
morning 1
the 1
unhappy 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
hid 1
himself 1
while 1
the 1
princess 1
would 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
the 1
sultan 1
sent 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
her 1
who 1
said 1
how 1
comes 1
it 1
child 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
speak 1
to 1
your 1
father 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
the 1
princess 1
sighed 1
deeply 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
told 1
her 1
mother 1
how 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
bed 1
had 1
been 1
carried 1
into 1
some 1
strange 1
house 1
and 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
there 1
her 1
mother 1
did 1
not 1
believe 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
but 1
bade 1
her 1
rise 1
and 1
consider 1
it 1
an 1
idle 1
dream 1
the 1
following 1
night 1
exactly 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
happened 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
on 1
the 1
princess 1
s 1
refusing 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
sultan 1
threatened 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
head 1
she 1
then 1
confessed 1
all 1
bidding 1
him 1
ask 1
the 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
so 1
the 1
sultan 1
told 1
the 1
vizier 1
to 1
ask 1
his 1
son 1
who 1
owned 1
the 1
truth 1
adding 1
that 1
dearly 1
as 1
he 1
loved 1
the 1
princess 1
he 1
had 1
rather 1
die 1
than 1
go 1
through 1
another 1
such 1
fearful 1
night 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
separated 1
from 1
her 1
his 1
wish 1
was 1
granted 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
feasting 1
and 1
rejoicing 1
when 1
the 1
three 1
months 1
were 1
over 1
aladdin 1
sent 1
his 1
mother 1
to 1
remind 1
the 1
sultan 1
of 1
his 1
promise 1
she 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
sultan 1
who 1
had 1
forgotten 1
aladdin 1
at 1
once 1
remembered 1
him 1
and 1
sent 1
for 1
her 1
on 1
seeing 1
her 1
poverty 1
the 1
sultan 1
felt 1
less 1
inclined 1
than 1
ever 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
word 1
and 1
asked 1
his 1

herself 1
carefully 1
and 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
with 1
her 1
slaves 1
while 1

followed 1

sultan 1
sent 1
musicians 1
with 1
trumpets 1
and 1
cymbals 1
to 1
meet 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
the 1

resounded 1
with 1
music 1
and 1
cheers 1

was 1
taken 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1

at 1
her 1
side 1
and 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
hundred 1
slaves 1
she 1
was 1
charmed 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
aladdin 1
who 1
ran 1
to 1
receive 1
her 1
princess 1
he 1
said 1
blame 1
your 1
beauty 1
for 1
my 1
boldness 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
displeased 1
you 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
having 1
seen 1
him 1
she 1
willingly 1
obeyed 1
her 1
father 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
after 1
the 1
wedding 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
aladdin 1
led 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
where 1
a 1
feast 1
was 1
spread 1
and 1
she 1
supped 1
with 1
him 1
after 1
which 1
they 1
danced 1
till 1
midnight 1
next 1
day 1
aladdin 1
invited 1
the 1
sultan 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
palace 1
on 1
entering 1
the 1
hall 1
with 1
the 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
windows 1
with 1
their 1
rubies 1
diamonds 1
and 1
emeralds 1
he 1
cried 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
world 1
s 1
wonder 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
that 1
surprises 1
me 1
was 1
it 1
by 1
accident 1
that 1
one 1
window 1
was 1
left 1
unfinished 1
no 1
sir 1
by 1
design 1
returned 1
aladdin 1
i 1
wished 1
your 1
majesty 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
glory 1
of 1
finishing 1
this 1
palace 1
the 1
sultan 1
was 1
pleased 1
and 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
jewelers 1
in 1
the 1
city 1
he 1
showed 1
them 1
the 1
unfinished 1
window 1
and 1
bade 1
them 1
fit 1
it 1
up 1
like 1
the 1
others 1
sir 1
replied 1
their 1
spokesman 1
we 1
cannot 1
find 1
jewels 1
enough 1
the 1
sultan 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
fetched 1
which 1
they 1
soon 1
used 1
but 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
for 1
in 1
a 1
month 1
s 1
time 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
not 1
half 1
done 1
aladdin 1
knowing 1
that 1
their 1
task 1
was 1
vain 1
bade 1
them 1
undo 1
their 1
work 1
and 1
carry 1
the 1
jewels 1
back 1
and 1
the 1
genie 1
finished 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
his 1
command 1
the 1
sultan 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
receive 1
his 1
jewels 1
again 1
and 1
visited 1
aladdin 1
who 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
window 1
finished 1
the 1
sultan 1
embraced 1
him 1
the 1
envious 1
vizier 1
meanwhile 1
hinting 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
enchantment 1
aladdin 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
by 1
his 1
gentle 1
bearing 1
he 1
was 1
made 1
captain 1
of 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
armies 1
and 1
won 1
several 1
battles 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
remained 1
as 1
courteous 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
lived 1
thus 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
content 1
for 1
several 1
years 1
but 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
africa 1
the 1
magician 1
remembered 1
aladdin 1
and 1
by 1
his 1
magic 1
arts 1
discovered 1
that 1
aladdin 1
instead 1
of 1
perishing 1
miserably 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
had 1
escaped 1
and 1
had 1
married 1
a 1
princess 1
with 1
whom 1
he 1
was 1
living 1
in 1
great 1
honour 1
and 1
wealth 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
tailor 1
s 1
son 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
accomplished 1
this 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
travelled 1
night 1
and 1
day 1
till 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
capital 1
of 1
china 1
bent 1
on 1
aladdin 1
s 1
ruin 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
town 1
he 1
heard 1
people 1
talking 1
everywhere 1
about 1
a 1
marvelous 1
palace 1
forgive 1
my 1
ignorance 1
he 1
asked 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
palace 1
you 1
speak 1
of 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
heard 1
of 1
prince 1
aladdin 1
s 1
palace 1
was 1
the 1
reply 1
the 1
greatest 1
wonder 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
will 1
direct 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
the 1
magician 1
thanked 1
him 1
who 1
spoke 1
and 1
having 1
seen 1
the 1
palace 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
raised 1
by 1
the 1
genie 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
became 1
half 1
mad 1
with 1
rage 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
again 1
plunge 1
aladdin 1
into 1
the 1
deepest 1
poverty 1
unluckily 1
aladdin 1
had 1
gone 1
a 1
hunting 1
for 1
eight 1
days 1
which 1
gave 1
the 1
magician 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
he 1
bought 1
a 1
dozen 1
lamps 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
basket 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
crying 1
new 1
lamps 1
for 1
old 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
jeering 1
crowd 1
the 1
princess 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
windows 1
sent 1
a 1
slave 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
the 1
noise 1
was 1
about 1
who 1
came 1
back 1
laughing 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
princess 1
scolded 1
her 1
madam 1
replied 1
the 1
slave 1
who 1
can 1
help 1
laughing 1
to 1
see 1
an 1
old 1
fool 1
offering 1
to 1
exchange 1
fine 1
new 1
lamps 1
for 1
old 1
ones 1
another 1
slave 1
hearing 1
this 1
said 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
cornice 1
there 1
which 1
he 1
can 1
have 1
now 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
magic 1
lamp 1
which 1
aladdin 1
had 1
left 1
there 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
out 1
hunting 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
princess 1
not 1
knowing 1
its 1
value 1
laughingly 1
bade 1
the 1
slave 1
take 1
it 1
and 1
make 1
the 1
exchange 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
magician 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
new 1
lamp 1
for 1
this 1
he 1
snatched 1
it 1
and 1
bade 1
the 1
slave 1
take 1
her 1
choice 1
amid 1
the 1
jeers 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
little 1
he 1
cared 1
but 1
left 1
off 1
crying 1
his 1
lamps 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
gates 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
remained 1
till 1
nightfall 1
when 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
the 1
genie 1
appeared 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
magician 1
s 1
command 1
carried 1
him 1
together 1
with 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
in 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
place 1
in 1
africa 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
sultan 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
towards 1
aladdin 1
s 1
palace 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
he 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
vizier 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
palace 1
the 1
vizier 1
looked 1
out 1
too 1
and 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
astonishment 1
he 1
again 1
put 1
it 1
down 1
to 1
enchantment 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
sultan 1
believed 1
him 1
and 1
sent 1
thirty 1
men 1
on 1
horseback 1
to 1
fetch 1
aladdin 1
back 1
in 1
chains 1
they 1
met 1
him 1
riding 1
home 1
bound 1
him 1
and 1
forced 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
them 1
on 1
foot 1
the 1
people 1
however 1
who 1
loved 1
him 1
followed 1
armed 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
no 1
harm 1
he 1
was 1
carried 1
before 1
the 1
sultan 1
who 1
ordered 1
the 1
executioner 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
executioner 1
made 1
aladdin 1
kneel 1
down 1
bandaged 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
raised 1
his 1
scimitar 1
to 1
strike 1
at 1
that 1
instant 1
the 1
vizier 1
who 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
crowd 1
had 1
forced 1
their 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
were 1
scaling 1
the 1
walls 1
to 1
rescue 1
aladdin 1
called 1
to 1
the 1
executioner 1
to 1
stay 1
his 1
hand 1
the 1
people 1
indeed 1
looked 1
so 1
threatening 1
that 1
the 1
sultan 1
gave 1
way 1
and 1
ordered 1
aladdin 1
to 1
be 1
unbound 1
and 1
pardoned 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
aladdin 1
now 1
begged 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
false 1
wretch 1
said 1
the 1
sultan 1
come 1
hither 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
his 1
palace 1
had 1
stood 1
aladdin 1
was 1
so 1
amazed 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
where 1
is 1
your 1
palace 1
and 1
my 1
daughter 1
demanded 1
the 1
sultan 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
so 1
deeply 1
concerned 1
but 1
my 1
daughter 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
find 1
her 1
or 1
lose 1
your 1
head 1
aladdin 1
begged 1
for 1
forty 1
days 1
in 1
which 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
promising 1
if 1
he 1
failed 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
suffer 1
death 1
at 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
pleasure 1
his 1
prayer 1
was 1
granted 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
forth 1
sadly 1
from 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
presence 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
he 1
wandered 1
about 1
like 1
a 1
madman 1
asking 1
everyone 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
his 1
palace 1
but 1
they 1
only 1
laughed 1
and 1
pitied 1
him 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
a 1
river 1
and 1
knelt 1
down 1
to 1
say 1
his 1
prayers 1
before 1
throwing 1
himself 1
in 1
in 1
doing 1
so 1
he 1
rubbed 1
the 1
ring 1
he 1
still 1
wore 1
the 1
genie 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
appeared 1
and 1
asked 1
his 1
will 1
save 1
my 1
life 1
genie 1
said 1
aladdin 1
and 1
bring 1
my 1
palace 1
back 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
said 1
the 1
genie 1
i 1
am 1
only 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
the 1
ring 1
you 1
must 1
ask 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
even 1
so 1
said 1
aladdin 1
but 1
thou 1
canst 1
take 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
set 1
me 1
down 1
under 1
my 1
dear 1
wife 1
s 1
window 1
he 1
at 1
once 1
found 1
himself 1
in 1
africa 1
under 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
out 1
of 1
sheer 1
weariness 1
he 1
was 1
awakened 1
by 1
the 1
singing 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
lighter 1
he 1
saw 1
plainly 1
that 1
all 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
were 1
owning 1
to 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
vainly 1
wondered 1
who 1
had 1
robbed 1
him 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
morning 1
the 1
princess 1
rose 1
earlier 1
than 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
carried 1
into 1
africa 1
by 1
the 1
magician 1
whose 1
company 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
endure 1
once 1
a 1
day 1
she 1
however 1
treated 1
him 1
so 1
harshly 1
that 1
he 1
dared 1
not 1
live 1
there 1
altogether 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
dressing 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
women 1
looked 1
out 1
and 1
saw 1
aladdin 1
the 1
princess 1
ran 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
noise 1
she 1
made 1
aladdin 1
looked 1
up 1
she 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
great 1
was 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
these 1
lovers 1
at 1
seeing 1
each 1
other 1
again 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
kissed 1
her 1
aladdin 1
said 1
i 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
princess 1
in 1
god 1
s 1
name 1
before 1
we 1
speak 1
of 1
anything 1
else 1
for 1
your 1
own 1
sake 1
and 1
mine 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
lamp 1
i 1
left 1
on 1
the 1
cornice 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
windows 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
a 1
hunting 1
alas 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
innocent 1
cause 1
of 1
our 1
sorrows 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
exchange 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
cried 1
aladdin 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
thank 1
the 1
african 1
magician 1
for 1
this 1
where 1
is 1
the 1
lamp 1
he 1
carries 1
it 1
about 1
with 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
i 1
know 1
for 1
he 1
pulled 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
breast 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
he 1
wishes 1
me 1
to 1
break 1
my 1
faith 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
marry 1
him 1
saying 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
beheaded 1
by 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
command 1
he 1
is 1
forever 1
speaking 1
ill 1
of 1
you 1
but 1
i 1
only 1
reply 1
by 1
my 1
tears 1
if 1
i 1
persist 1
i 1
doubt 1
not 1
but 1
he 1
will 1
use 1
violence 1
aladdin 1
comforted 1
her 1
and 1
left 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
changed 1
clothes 1
with 1
the 1
first 1
person 1
he 1
met 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
having 1
bought 1
a 1
certain 1
powder 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
who 1
let 1
him 1
in 1
by 1
a 1
little 1
side 1
door 1
put 1
on 1
your 1
most 1
beautiful 1
dress 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
receive 1
the 1
magician 1
with 1
smiles 1
leading 1
him 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
forgotten 1
me 1
invite 1
him 1
to 1
sup 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
say 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
taste 1
the 1
wine 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
he 1
will 1
go 1
for 1
some 1
and 1
while 1
he 1
is 1
gone 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
she 1
listened 1
carefully 1
to 1
aladdin 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
arrayed 1
herself 1
gaily 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
since 1
she 1
left 1
china 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
girdle 1
and 1
head 1
dress 1
of 1
diamonds 1
and 1
seeing 1
in 1
a 1
glass 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
more 1
beautiful 1
than 1
ever 1
received 1
the 1
magician 1
saying 1
to 1
his 1
great 1
amazement 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
aladdin 1
is 1
dead 1
and 1
that 1
all 1
my 1
tears 1
will 1
not 1
bring 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
so 1
i 1
am 1
resolved 1
to 1
mourn 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
have 1
therefore 1
invited 1
you 1
to 1
sup 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
the 1
wines 1
of 1
china 1
and 1
would 1
fain 1
taste 1
those 1
of 1
africa 1
the 1
magician 1
flew 1
to 1
his 1
cellar 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
put 1
the 1
powder 1
aladdin 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
cup 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
she 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
drink 1
her 1
health 1
in 1
the 1
wine 1
of 1
africa 1
handing 1
him 1
her 1
cup 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
his 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
she 1
was 1
reconciled 1
to 1
him 1
before 1
drinking 1
the 1
magician 1
made 1
her 1
a 1
speech 1
in 1
praise 1
of 1
her 1
beauty 1
but 1
the 1
princess 1
cut 1
him 1
short 1
saying 1
let 1
us 1
drink 1
first 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
say 1
what 1
you 1
will 1
afterwards 1
she 1
set 1
her 1
cup 1
to 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
kept 1
it 1
there 1
while 1
the 1
magician 1
drained 1
his 1
to 1
the 1
dregs 1
and 1
fell 1
back 1
lifeless 1
the 1
princess 1
then 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
aladdin 1
and 1
flung 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
but 1
aladdin 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
dead 1
magician 1
took 1
the 1
lamp 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
vest 1
and 1
bade 1
the 1
genie 1
carry 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
all 1
in 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
china 1
this 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
in 1
her 1
chamber 1
felt 1
only 1
two 1
little 1
shocks 1
and 1
little 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
home 1
again 1
the 1
sultan 1
who 1
was 1
sitting 1
in 1
his 1
closet 1
mourning 1
for 1
his 1
lost 1
daughter 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
up 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
there 1
stood 1
the 1
palace 1
as 1
before 1
he 1
hastened 1
thither 1
and 1
aladdin 1
received 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
the 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
windows 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
at 1
his 1
side 1
aladdin 1
told 1
him 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
magician 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
believe 1
a 1
ten 1
days 1
feast 1
was 1
proclaimed 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
aladdin 1
might 1
now 1
live 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
peace 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
meant 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
african 1
magician 1
had 1
a 1
younger 1
brother 1
who 1
was 1
if 1
possible 1
more 1
wicked 1
and 1
more 1
cunning 1
than 1
himself 1
he 1
travelled 1
to 1
china 1
to 1
avenge 1
his 1
brother 1
s 1
death 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
visit 1
a 1
pious 1
woman 1
called 1
fatima 1
thinking 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
entered 1
her 1
cell 1
and 1
clapped 1
a 1
dagger 1
to 1
her 1
breast 1
telling 1
her 1
to 1
rise 1
and 1
do 1
his 1
bidding 1
on 1
pain 1
of 1
death 1
he 1
changed 1
clothes 1
with 1
her 1
coloured 1
his 1
face 1
like 1
hers 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
veil 1
and 1
murdered 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
tell 1
no 1
tales 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
towards 1
the 1
palace 1
of 1
aladdin 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
thinking 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
holy 1
woman 1
gathered 1
round 1
him 1
kissing 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
begging 1
his 1
blessing 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
there 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
noise 1
going 1
on 1
round 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
princess 1
bade 1
her 1
slave 1
look 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
ask 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
the 1
slave 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
holy 1
woman 1
curing 1
people 1
by 1
her 1
touch 1
of 1
their 1
ailments 1
whereupon 1
the 1
princess 1
who 1
had 1
long 1
desired 1
to 1
see 1
fatima 1
sent 1
for 1
her 1
on 1
coming 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
the 1
magician 1
offered 1
up 1
a 1
prayer 1
for 1
her 1
health 1
and 1
prosperity 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
princess 1
made 1
him 1
sit 1
by 1
her 1
and 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
her 1
always 1
the 1
false 1
fatima 1
who 1
wished 1
for 1
nothing 1
better 1
consented 1
but 1
kept 1
his 1
veil 1
down 1
for 1
fear 1
of 1
discovery 1
the 1
princess 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
truly 1
beautiful 1
said 1
the 1
false 1
fatima 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
it 1
wants 1
but 1
one 1
thing 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
if 1
only 1
a 1
roc 1
s 1
egg 1
replied 1
he 1
were 1
hung 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
this 1
dome 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
princess 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
roc 1
s 1
egg 1
and 1
when 1
aladdin 1
returned 1
from 1
hunting 1
he 1
found 1
her 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
ill 1
humour 1
he 1
begged 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
amiss 1
and 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
all 1
her 1
pleasure 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
was 1
spoilt 1
for 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
roc 1
s 1
egg 1
hanging 1
from 1
the 1
dome 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
replied 1
aladdin 1
you 1
shall 1
soon 1
be 1
happy 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
and 1
rubbed 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
genie 1
appeared 1
commanded 1
him 1
to 1
bring 1
a 1
roc 1
s 1
egg 1
the 1
genie 1
gave 1
such 1
a 1
loud 1
and 1
terrible 1
shriek 1
that 1
the 1
hall 1
shook 1
wretch 1
he 1
cried 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
enough 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
everything 1
for 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
command 1
me 1
to 1
bring 1
my 1
master 1
and 1
hang 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
this 1
dome 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
wife 1
and 1
your 1
palace 1
deserve 1
to 1
be 1
burnt 1
to 1
ashes 1
but 1
that 1
this 1
request 1
does 1
not 1
come 1
from 1
you 1
but 1
from 1
the 1
brother 1
of 1
the 1
african 1
magician 1
whom 1
you 1
destroyed 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
in 1
your 1
palace 1
disguised 1
as 1
the 1
holy 1
woman 1
whom 1
he 1
murdered 1
he 1
it 1
was 1
who 1

that 1
wish 1
into 1
your 1

head 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
yourself 1

he 1
means 1
to 1

you 1
so 1
saying 1
the 1
genie 1
disappeared 1
aladdin 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
saying 1
his 1
head 1
ached 1
and 1
requesting 1
that 1
the 1
holy 1
fatima 1
should 1
be 1
fetched 1
to 1
lay 1
her 1
hands 1
on 1
it 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
magician 1
came 1
near 1
aladdin 1
seizing 1
his 1
dagger 1
pierced 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
done 1
cried 1
the 1

the 1
holy 1
woman 1
not 1
so 1

a 1

the 1
motto 1
that 1

is 1
best 1
which 1
governs 1
least 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
like 1

it 1
acted 1
up 1
to 1
more 1
rapidly 1
and 1
systematically 1
carried 1
out 1
it 1
finally 1
amounts 1
to 1
this 1
which 1
also 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
government 1
is 1
best 1
which 1
governs 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
when 1
men 1
are 1
prepared 1
for 1
it 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
government 1
which 1
they 1
will 1
have 1
government 1
is 1
at 1
best 1
but 1
an 1
expedient 1
but 1
most 1
governments 1
are 1
usually 1
and 1
all 1
governments 1
are 1
sometimes 1
inexpedient 1
the 1
objections 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
brought 1
against 1
a 1
standing 1
army 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
many 1
and 1
weighty 1
and 1
deserve 1
to 1
prevail 1
may 1
also 1
at 1
last 1
be 1
brought 1
against 1
a 1
standing 1
government 1
the 1
standing 1
army 1
is 1
only 1
an 1
arm 1
of 1
the 1
standing 1
government 1
the 1
government 1
itself 1
which 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
mode 1
which 1
the 1
people 1
have 1
chosen 1
to 1
execute 1
their 1
will 1
is 1
equally 1
liable 1
to 1
be 1
abused 1
and 1
perverted 1
before 1
the 1
people 1
can 1
act 1
through 1
it 1
witness 1
the 1
present 1
mexican 1
war 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
comparatively 1
a 1
few 1
individuals 1
using 1
the 1
standing 1
government 1
as 1
their 1
tool 1
for 1
in 1
the 1
outset 1
the 1
people 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
consented 1
to 1
this 1
measure 1
this 1
american 1
government 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
but 1
a 1
tradition 1
though 1
a 1
recent 1
one 1
endeavoring 1
to 1
transmit 1
itself 1
unimpaired 1
to 1
posterity 1
but 1
each 1
instant 1
losing 1
some 1
of 1
its 1
integrity 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
the 1
vitality 1
and 1
force 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
living 1
man 1
for 1
a 1
single 1
man 1
can 1
bend 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
will 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
wooden 1
gun 1
to 1
the 1
people 1
themselves 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
less 1
necessary 1
for 1
this 1
for 1
the 1
people 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
complicated 1
machinery 1
or 1
other 1
and 1
hear 1
its 1
din 1
to 1
satisfy 1
that 1
idea 1
of 1
government 1
which 1
they 1
have 1
governments 1
show 1
thus 1
how 1
successfully 1
men 1
can 1
be 1
imposed 1
upon 1
even 1
impose 1
on 1
themselves 1
for 1
their 1
own 1
advantage 1
it 1
is 1
excellent 1
we 1
must 1
all 1
allow 1
yet 1
this 1
government 1
never 1
of 1
itself 1
furthered 1
any 1
enterprise 1
but 1
by 1
the 1
alacrity 1
with 1
which 1
it 1
got 1
out 1

done 1
all 1
that 1

it 1

somewhat 1
more 1

of 1

would 1

be 1
one 1
step 1
toward 1
obtaining 1
it 1
after 1
all 1
the 1

reason 1
why 1
when 1
the 1

once 1
in 1
the 1

of 1
the 1
people 1

majority 1
are 1
permitted 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
period 1
continue 1
to 1
rule 1
is 1
not 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
most 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
right 1
nor 1
because 1
this 1
seems 1
fairest 1
to 1
the 1
minority 1
but 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
physically 1
the 1
strongest 1
but 1
a 1
government 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
majority 1
rule 1
in 1
all 1
cases 1
can 1
not 1
be 1
based 1
on 1
justice 1
even 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
men 1
understand 1
it 1
can 1
there 1
not 1
be 1
a 1
government 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
majorities 1
do 1
not 1
virtually 1
decide 1
right 1
and 1
wrong 1
but 1
conscience 1
in 1
which 1
majorities 1
decide 1
only 1
those 1
questions 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
rule 1
of 1
expediency 1
is 1
applicable 1
must 1
the 1
citizen 1
ever 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
degree 1
resign 1
his 1
conscience 1
to 1
the 1
legislator 1
why 1
has 1
every 1
man 1
a 1
conscience 1
then 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
men 1
first 1
and 1
subjects 1
afterward 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
desirable 1
to 1
cultivate 1
a 1
respect 1
for 1
the 1
law 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
right 1
the 1
only 1
obligation 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
assume 1
is 1
to 1
do 1
at 1
any 1
time 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
right 1
it 1
is 1
truly 1
enough 1
said 1
that 1
a 1
corporation 1
has 1
no 1
conscience 1
but 1
a 1
corporation 1
of 1
conscientious 1
men 1
is 1
a 1
corporation 1
_with_ 1
a 1
conscience 1
law 1
never 1
made 1
men 1
a 1
whit 1
more 1
just 1
and 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
their 1
respect 1
for 1
it 1
even 1
the 1
well 1
disposed 1
are 1
daily 1
made 1
the 1
agents 1
on 1
injustice 1
a 1
common 1
and 1
natural 1
result 1
of 1
an 1
undue 1
respect 1
for 1
the 1
law 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
see 1
a 1

of 1
soldiers 1
colonel 1
captain 1
corporal 1
privates 1
powder 1

and 1
all 1
marching 1
in 1
admirable 1
order 1
over 1
hill 1

to 1
the 1
wars 1
against 1
their 1
wills 1
ay 1
against 1
their 1
common 1
sense 1
and 1
consciences 1
which 1
makes 1
it 1
very 1
steep 1
marching 1
indeed 1
and 1
produces 1
a 1
palpitation 1
of 1
the 1
heart 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
damnable 1
business 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
are 1
concerned 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
peaceably 1
inclined 1

it 1
can 1
make 1
a 1

with 1
its 1
black 1

a 1
mere 1
shadow 1
and 1

of 1

a 1

laid 1
out 1
alive 1

standing 1

already 1
as 1

may 1
say 1
buried 1

with 1
funeral 1
accompaniment 1

it 1
may 1
be 1

of 1

the 1

thus 1
not 1
as 1
men 1
mainly 1
but 1
as 1
machines 1
with 1
their 1
bodies 1
they 1

whatever 1
of 1
the 1
judgement 1

of 1

can 1
perhaps 1
be 1
manufactured 1
that 1
will 1
serve 1
the 1
purpose 1
as 1
well 1
such 1
command 1
no 1
more 1
respect 1
than 1
men 1
of 1
straw 1

a 1

of 1

they 1
have 1
the 1

sort 1
of 1
worth 1
only 1

yet 1
such 1
as 1
these 1
even 1
are 1
commonly 1
esteemed 1
good 1
citizens 1
others 1
as 1
most 1
legislators 1
politicians 1
lawyers 1
ministers 1
and 1
office 1
holders 1
serve 1
the 1
state 1
chiefly 1
with 1
their 1
heads 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
rarely 1
make 1
any 1
moral 1
distinctions 1
they 1
are 1
as 1
likely 1
to 1
serve 1
the 1
devil 1
without 1
_intending_ 1
it 1
as 1
god 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
as 1
heroes 1
patriots 1
martyrs 1
reformers 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
sense 1
and 1
_men_ 1
serve 1
the 1
state 1
with 1
their 1
consciences 1
also 1
and 1
so 1
necessarily 1
resist 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
commonly 1
treated 1
as 1
enemies 1
by 1
it 1
a 1
wise 1
man 1
will 1
only 1
be 1
useful 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
will 1
not 1
submit 1
to 1
be 1
clay 1
and 1
stop 1
a 1
hole 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
wind 1
away 1
but 1
leave 1
that 1
office 1
to 1
his 1
dust 1
at 1
least 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
high 1
born 1
to 1
be 1
propertied 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
second 1
at 1

useful 1

man 1

instrument 1
to 1
any 1
sovereign 1
state 1
throughout 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
who 1
gives 1
himself 1
entirely 1
to 1
his 1
fellow 1
men 1
appears 1
to 1
them 1
useless 1
and 1
selfish 1
but 1
he 1
who 1
gives 1
himself 1
partially 1
to 1
them 1
is 1
pronounced 1
a 1
benefactor 1
and 1
philanthropist 1
how 1
does 1
it 1
become 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
behave 1
toward 1
the 1
american 1
government 1
today 1
i 1
answer 1
that 1
he 1
cannot 1
without 1
disgrace 1
be 1
associated 1
with 1
it 1
i 1
cannot 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
recognize 1
that 1
political 1
organization 1
as 1
_my_ 1
government 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
_slave 1
s_ 1
government 1
also 1
all 1
men 1
recognize 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
revolution 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
refuse 1
allegiance 1
to 1
and 1
to 1
resist 1
the 1
government 1
when 1
its 1
tyranny 1
or 1
its 1
inefficiency 1
are 1
great 1
and 1
unendurable 1
but 1
almost 1
all 1
say 1
that 1
such 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
case 1
now 1
but 1
such 1
was 1
the 1
case 1
they 1
think 1
in 1
the 1
revolution 1
of 1
75 1
if 1
one 1
were 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
bad 1
government 1
because 1
it 1
taxed 1
certain 1
foreign 1
commodities 1
brought 1
to 1
its 1
ports 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
probable 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
make 1
an 1
ado 1
about 1
it 1
for 1
i 1
can 1
do 1
without 1
them 1
all 1
machines 1
have 1
their 1
friction 1
and 1
possibly 1
this 1
does 1
enough 1
good 1
to 1
counter 1
balance 1
the 1
evil 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
evil 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
stir 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
friction 1
comes 1
to 1
have 1
its 1
machine 1
and 1
oppression 1
and 1
robbery 1
are 1
organized 1
i 1
say 1
let 1
us 1
not 1
have 1
such 1
a 1
machine 1
any 1
longer 1
in 1
other 1
words 1
when 1
a 1
sixth 1
of 1
the 1
population 1
of 1
a 1
nation 1
which 1
has 1
undertaken 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
refuge 1
of 1
liberty 1
are 1
slaves 1
and 1
a 1
whole 1
country 1
is 1
unjustly 1
overrun 1
and 1
conquered 1
by 1
a 1
foreign 1
army 1
and 1
subjected 1
to 1
military 1
law 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
too 1
soon 1
for 1
honest 1
men 1
to 1
rebel 1
and 1
revolutionize 1
what 1
makes 1
this 1
duty 1
the 1
more 1
urgent 1
is 1
that 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
country 1
so 1
overrun 1
is 1
not 1
our 1
own 1
but 1
ours 1
is 1
the 1
invading 1
army 1
paley 1
a 1
common 1
authority 1
with 1
many 1
on 1
moral 1
questions 1
in 1
his 1
chapter 1
on 1
the 1
duty 1
of 1
submission 1
to 1
civil 1
government 1
resolves 1
all 1
civil 1
obligation 1
into 1
expediency 1
and 1
he 1
proceeds 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
society 1
requires 1
it 1
that 1
is 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
established 1
government 1
cannot 1
be 1
resisted 1
or 1
changed 1
without 1
public 1
inconvenience 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
god 1
that 1
the 1
established 1
government 1
be 1
obeyed 1
and 1
no 1
longer 1
this 1
principle 1
being 1
admitted 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
every 1
particular 1
case 1
of 1
resistance 1
is 1
reduced 1
to 1
a 1
computation 1
of 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
the 1
danger 1
and 1
grievance 1
on 1
the 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
probability 1
and 1
expense 1
of 1
redressing 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
this 1
he 1
says 1
every 1
man 1
shall 1
judge 1
for 1
himself 1
but 1
paley 1
appears 1
never 1
to 1
have 1
contemplated 1
those 1
cases 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
rule 1
of 1
expediency 1
does 1
not 1
apply 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
people 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
an 1
individual 1
must 1
do 1
justice 1
cost 1
what 1
it 1
may 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
unjustly 1
wrested 1
a 1
plank 1
from 1
a 1
drowning 1
man 1
i 1
must 1
restore 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
though 1
i 1
drown 1
myself 1
this 1
according 1
to 1
paley 1
would 1
be 1
inconvenient 1
but 1
he 1
that 1
would 1
save 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
case 1
shall 1
lose 1
it 1
this 1
people 1
must 1
cease 1
to 1
hold 1
slaves 1
and 1
to 1
make 1
war 1
on 1
mexico 1

it 1
cost 1
them 1
their 1
existence 1
as 1
a 1

anyone 1

that 1

does 1
exactly 1
what 1

at 1

practically 1
speaking 1
the 1
opponents 1
to 1
a 1

in 1
massachusetts 1
are 1
not 1
a 1
hundred 1
thousand 1
politicians 1
at 1
the 1
south 1
but 1
a 1
hundred 1
thousand 1
merchants 1

farmers 1
here 1
who 1
are 1
more 1
interested 1
in 1
commerce 1

they 1

the 1

we 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
mass 1
of 1
men 1
are 1
unprepared 1
but 1
improvement 1
is 1
slow 1
because 1
the 1

are 1
not 1
as 1
materially 1
wiser 1
or 1
better 1
than 1
the 1
many 1
it 1
is 1
not 1

that 1

should 1

there 1
are 1
thousands 1
who 1
are 1
_in 1
opinion_ 1
opposed 1
to 1
slavery 1
and 1
to 1
the 1

who 1
yet 1
in 1
effect 1
do 1
nothing 1
to 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
them 1
who 1
esteeming 1
themselves 1
children 1
of 1
washington 1
and 1
franklin 1
sit 1
down 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
in 1
their 1
pockets 1
and 1
say 1
that 1
they 1
know 1
not 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
do 1
nothing 1
who 1
even 1
postpone 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
freedom 1
to 1
the 1
question 1

the 1

an 1
honest 1
man 1

patriot 1
today 1
they 1
hesitate 1
and 1
they 1
regret 1
and 1
sometimes 1
they 1
petition 1
but 1
they 1
do 1
nothing 1
in 1
earnest 1
and 1
with 1
effect 1
they 1
will 1
wait 1
well 1
disposed 1

to 1
remedy 1
the 1
evil 1
that 1
they 1
may 1
no 1
longer 1
have 1
it 1
to 1
regret 1
at 1
most 1
they 1
give 1
up 1
only 1
a 1
cheap 1
vote 1
and 1
a 1
feeble 1
countenance 1

godspeed 1

the 1
right 1

it 1
goes 1

ninety 1
nine 1
patrons 1
of 1
virtue 1
to 1
one 1
virtuous 1
man 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
easier 1
to 1
deal 1
with 1
the 1
real 1
possessor 1
of 1
a 1
thing 1
than 1
with 1
the 1
temporary 1
guardian 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
voting 1
is 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
gaming 1
like 1
checkers 1
or 1
backgammon 1
with 1
a 1
slight 1
moral 1
tinge 1
to 1
it 1
a 1
playing 1
with 1
right 1
and 1
wrong 1
with 1
moral 1
questions 1
and 1
betting 1
naturally 1
accompanies 1
it 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
voters 1
is 1
not 1
staked 1
i 1
cast 1
my 1
vote 1
perchance 1
as 1
i 1
think 1
right 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
vitally 1
concerned 1
that 1
that 1
right 1
should 1
prevail 1
i 1
am 1
willing 1
to 1
leave 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
majority 1
its 1
obligation 1
therefore 1
never 1
exceeds 1
that 1
of 1
expediency 1
even 1
_voting 1
for 1
the 1
right_ 1
is 1
_doing_ 1
nothing 1
for 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
expressing 1
to 1
men 1
feebly 1
your 1
desire 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
prevail 1
a 1
wise 1
man 1
will 1
not 1
leave 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
chance 1
nor 1
wish 1
it 1
to 1
prevail 1
through 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
the 1
majority 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
little 1
virtue 1
in 1
the 1
action 1
of 1
masses 1
of 1
men 1
when 1
the 1
majority 1
shall 1
at 1
length 1
vote 1
for 1
the 1
abolition 1
of 1
slavery 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
indifferent 1
to 1
slavery 1
or 1
because 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
little 1
slavery 1
left 1
to 1
be 1
abolished 1
by 1
their 1
vote 1
_they_ 1
will 1
then 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
slaves 1
only 1
_his_ 1
vote 1
can 1
hasten 1
the 1
abolition 1
of 1
slavery 1
who 1
asserts 1
his 1
own 1
freedom 1
by 1
his 1
vote 1
i 1
hear 1
of 1
a 1
convention 1
to 1
be 1
held 1
at 1
baltimore 1
or 1
elsewhere 1
for 1
the 1
selection 1
of 1
a 1
candidate 1
for 1
the 1
presidency 1
made 1
up 1
chiefly 1
of 1
editors 1
and 1
men 1
who 1
are 1
politicians 1
by 1
profession 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
to 1
any 1
independent 1
intelligent 1
and 1
respectable 1
man 1
what 1
decision 1
they 1
may 1
come 1
to 1
shall 1
we 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
this 1
wisdom 1
and 1
honesty 1
nevertheless 1
can 1
we 1
not 1
count 1
upon 1
some 1
independent 1
votes 1
are 1
there 1
not 1
many 1
individuals 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
who 1
do 1
not 1
attend 1
conventions 1
but 1
no 1
i 1
find 1
that 1
the 1
respectable 1
man 1
so 1
called 1
has 1
immediately 1
drifted 1
from 1
his 1
position 1
and 1
despairs 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
when 1
his 1
country 1
has 1
more 1
reasons 1
to 1
despair 1
of 1
him 1
he 1
forthwith 1
adopts 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
candidates 1
thus 1
selected 1
as 1
the 1
only 1
_available_ 1
one 1
thus 1
proving 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
himself 1
_available_ 1
for 1
any 1
purposes 1
of 1
the 1
demagogue 1
his 1
vote 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
more 1
worth 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
any 1
unprincipled 1
foreigner 1
or 1
hireling 1
native 1
who 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
bought 1
o 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
as 1
my 1
neighbor 1
says 1
has 1
a 1
bone 1
in 1
his 1
back 1
which 1
you 1
cannot 1
pass 1
your 1
hand 1
through 1
our 1
statistics 1
are 1
at 1
fault 1
the 1
population 1
has 1
been 1
returned 1
too 1
large 1
how 1
many 1
_men_ 1
are 1
there 1
to 1
a 1
square 1
thousand 1
miles 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
hardly 1
one 1
does 1
not 1
america 1
offer 1
any 1
inducement 1
for 1
men 1
to 1
settle 1
here 1
the 1
american 1
has 1
dwindled 1
into 1
an 1
odd 1
fellow 1
one 1
who 1
may 1
be 1
known 1
by 1
the 1
development 1
of 1
his 1
organ 1
of 1
gregariousness 1
and 1
a 1
manifest 1
lack 1
of 1
intellect 1
and 1
cheerful 1
self 1
reliance 1
whose 1
first 1
and 1
chief 1
concern 1
on 1
coming 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
almshouses 1
are 1
in 1
good 1
repair 1
and 1
before 1
yet 1
he 1
has 1
lawfully 1
donned 1
the 1
virile 1
garb 1
to 1
collect 1
a 1
fund 1
to 1
the 1
support 1
of 1
the 1
widows 1
and 1
orphans 1
that 1
may 1
be 1
who 1
in 1
short 1
ventures 1
to 1
live 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
the 1
mutual 1
insurance 1
company 1
which 1
has 1
promised 1
to 1
bury 1
him 1
decently 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
duty 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
course 1
to 1
devote 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
eradication 1
of 1
any 1
even 1
to 1
most 1
enormous 1
wrong 1
he 1
may 1
still 1
properly 1
have 1
other 1
concerns 1
to 1
engage 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
his 1
duty 1
at 1
least 1
to 1
wash 1
his 1
hands 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
gives 1
it 1
no 1
thought 1
longer 1
not 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
practically 1
his 1
support 1
if 1
i 1
devote 1
myself 1
to 1
other 1
pursuits 1
and 1
contemplations 1
i 1
must 1
first 1
see 1
at 1
least 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
pursue 1
them 1
sitting 1
upon 1
another 1
man 1
s 1
shoulders 1
i 1
must 1
get 1
off 1
him 1
first 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
pursue 1
his 1
contemplations 1
too 1
see 1
what 1
gross 1
inconsistency 1
is 1
tolerated 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
some 1
of 1
my 1
townsmen 1
say 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
order 1
me 1
out 1
to 1
help 1
put 1
down 1
an 1
insurrection 1
of 1
the 1
slaves 1
or 1
to 1
march 1
to 1
mexico 1
see 1
if 1
i 1
would 1
go 1
and 1
yet 1
these 1
very 1
men 1
have 1
each 1
directly 1
by 1
their 1
allegiance 1
and 1
so 1
indirectly 1
at 1
least 1
by 1
their 1
money 1
furnished 1
a 1
substitute 1
the 1
soldier 1
is 1
applauded 1
who 1
refuses 1
to 1
serve 1
in 1
an 1
unjust 1
war 1
by 1
those 1
who 1
do 1
not 1
refuse 1
to 1
sustain 1
the 1
unjust 1
government 1
which 1
makes 1
the 1
war 1
is 1
applauded 1
by 1
those 1
whose 1
own 1
act 1
and 1
authority 1
he 1
disregards 1
and 1
sets 1
at 1
naught 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
state 1
were 1
penitent 1
to 1
that 1
degree 1
that 1
it 1
hired 1
one 1
to 1
scourge 1
it 1
while 1
it 1
sinned 1
but 1
not 1
to 1
that 1
degree 1
that 1
it 1
left 1
off 1
sinning 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
thus 1
under 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
order 1
and 1
civil 1
government 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
made 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
pay 1
homage 1
to 1
and 1
support 1
our 1
own 1
meanness 1
after 1
the 1
first 1
blush 1
of 1
sin 1
comes 1
its 1
indifference 1
and 1
from 1
immoral 1
it 1
becomes 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
unmoral 1
and 1
not 1
quite 1
unnecessary 1
to 1
that 1
life 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
made 1
the 1
broadest 1
and 1
most 1
prevalent 1
error 1
requires 1
the 1
most 1
disinterested 1
virtue 1
to 1
sustain 1
it 1
the 1
slight 1
reproach 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
virtue 1
of 1
patriotism 1
is 1
commonly 1
liable 1
the 1
noble 1
are 1
most 1
likely 1
to 1
incur 1
those 1
who 1
while 1
they 1
disapprove 1
of 1
the 1
character 1
and 1
measures 1
of 1
a 1
government 1
yield 1
to 1
it 1
their 1
allegiance 1
and 1
support 1
are 1
undoubtedly 1
its 1
most 1
conscientious 1
supporters 1
and 1
so 1
frequently 1
the 1
most 1
serious 1
obstacles 1
to 1
reform 1
some 1
are 1
petitioning 1
the 1
state 1
to 1
dissolve 1
the 1
union 1
to 1
disregard 1
the 1
requisitions 1
of 1
the 1
president 1
why 1
do 1
they 1
not 1
dissolve 1
it 1
themselves 1
the 1
union 1
between 1
themselves 1
and 1
the 1
state 1
and 1
refuse 1
to 1
pay 1
their 1
quota 1
into 1
its 1
treasury 1
do 1
not 1
they 1
stand 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
relation 1
to 1
the 1
state 1
that 1
the 1
state 1
does 1
to 1
the 1
union 1
and 1
have 1
not 1
the 1
same 1
reasons 1
prevented 1
the 1
state 1
from 1
resisting 1
the 1
union 1
which 1
have 1
prevented 1
them 1
from 1
resisting 1
the 1
state 1
how 1
can 1
a 1
man 1
be 1
satisfied 1
to 1
entertain 1
an 1
opinion 1
merely 1

would 1
be 1
worse 1
than 1

it 1
is 1
the 1
fault 1
of 1
the 1

itself 1
that 1
the 1
remedy 1
is 1
worse 1
than 1

makes 1
it 1
worse 1

is 1
it 1
not 1
more 1
apt 1
to 1
anticipate 1

for 1
reform 1
why 1
does 1
it 1
not 1

its 1
wise 1
minority 1
why 1
does 1
it 1
cry 1

before 1
it 1
is 1
hurt 1
why 1
does 1
it 1
not 1
encourage 1
its 1
citizens 1
to 1
put 1
out 1
its 1
faults 1
and 1
_do_ 1
better 1
than 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
them 1
why 1
does 1
it 1
always 1
crucify 1
christ 1
and 1
excommunicate 1
copernicus 1
and 1
luther 1
and 1
pronounce 1
washington 1
and 1
franklin 1
rebels 1
one 1
would 1
think 1
that 1
a 1
deliberate 1
and 1
practical 1
denial 1
of 1
its 1
authority 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
offense 1
never 1
contemplated 1
by 1
its 1
government 1
else 1
why 1
has 1
it 1
not 1
assigned 1
its 1
definite 1
its 1
suitable 1
and 1
proportionate 1
penalty 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
no 1
property 1
refuses 1
but 1
once 1
to 1
earn 1
nine 1
shillings 1
for 1
the 1
state 1
he 1
is 1
put 1
in 1
prison 1
for 1
a 1
period 1
unlimited 1
by 1
any 1
law 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
and 1
determined 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
discretion 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
put 1
him 1
there 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
steal 1
ninety 1
times 1
nine 1
shillings 1
from 1
the 1
state 1
he 1
is 1
soon 1
permitted 1
to 1
go 1
at 1
large 1
again 1
if 1
the 1
injustice 1
is 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
necessary 1
friction 1
of 1
the 1
machine 1
of 1
government 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
perchance 1
it 1
will 1
wear 1
smooth 1
certainly 1
the 1
machine 1
will 1
wear 1
out 1
if 1
the 1
injustice 1
has 1
a 1
spring 1
or 1
a 1
pulley 1
or 1
a 1
rope 1
or 1
a 1
crank 1
exclusively 1
for 1
itself 1
then 1
perhaps 1
you 1
may 1
consider 1
whether 1
the 1
remedy 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
worse 1
than 1
the 1
evil 1
but 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
nature 1
that 1
it 1
requires 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
agent 1
of 1
injustice 1
to 1
another 1
then 1
i 1
say 1
break 1
the 1
law 1
let 1
your 1
life 1
be 1
a 1
counter 1
friction 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
machine 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
see 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
lend 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
wrong 1
which 1
i 1
condemn 1
as 1
for 1
adopting 1
the 1
ways 1
of 1
the 1
state 1
has 1
provided 1
for 1
remedying 1
the 1
evil 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
of 1
such 1
ways 1
they 1
take 1
too 1
much 1
time 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
life 1
will 1
be 1
gone 1
i 1
have 1
other 1
affairs 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
i 1
came 1
into 1
this 1
world 1
not 1
chiefly 1
to 1
make 1
this 1
a 1
good 1
place 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
but 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
it 1
be 1
it 1
good 1
or 1
bad 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
not 1
everything 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
something 1
and 1
because 1
he 1
cannot 1
do 1
_everything_ 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
necessary 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
doing 1
_something_ 1
wrong 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
business 1
to 1
be 1
petitioning 1
the 1
governor 1
or 1
the 1
legislature 1
any 1
more 1
than 1
it 1
is 1
theirs 1
to 1
petition 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
should 1
not 1
hear 1
my 1
petition 1
what 1
should 1
i 1
do 1
then 1
but 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
the 1
state 1
has 1
provided 1
no 1
way 1
its 1
very 1
constitution 1
is 1
the 1
evil 1
this 1
may 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
harsh 1
and 1
stubborn 1
and 1
unconcilliatory 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
treat 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
kindness 1
and 1
consideration 1
the 1
only 1
spirit 1
that 1
can 1
appreciate 1
or 1
deserves 1
it 1
so 1
is 1
all 1
change 1
for 1
the 1
better 1
like 1
birth 1
and 1
death 1
which 1
convulse 1
the 1
body 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
hesitate 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
those 1
who 1
call 1
themselves 1
abolitionists 1
should 1
at 1
once 1
effectually 1
withdraw 1
their 1
support 1
both 1
in 1
person 1
and 1
property 1
from 1
the 1
government 1
of 1
massachusetts 1
and 1
not 1
wait 1
till 1
they 1
constitute 1
a 1
majority 1
of 1
one 1
before 1
they 1
suffer 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
prevail 1
through 1
them 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
enough 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
god 1
on 1
their 1
side 1
without 1
waiting 1
for 1
that 1
other 1
one 1
moreover 1
any 1
man 1
more 1
right 1
than 1
his 1
neighbors 1
constitutes 1
a 1
majority 1
of 1
one 1
already 1
i 1
meet 1
this 1
american 1
government 1
or 1
its 1
representative 1
the 1
state 1
government 1
directly 1
and 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
once 1
a 1
year 1
no 1
more 1
in 1
the 1
person 1
of 1
its 1
tax 1
gatherer 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
mode 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
man 1
situated 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
necessarily 1
meets 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
then 1
says 1
distinctly 1
recognize 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
simplest 1
the 1
most 1
effectual 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
present 1
posture 1
of 1
affairs 1
the 1
indispensablest 1
mode 1
of 1
treating 1
with 1
it 1
on 1
this 1
head 1
of 1
expressing 1
your 1
little 1
satisfaction 1
with 1
and 1
love 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
deny 1
it 1
then 1
my 1
civil 1
neighbor 1
the 1
tax 1
gatherer 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
man 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
deal 1
with 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
after 1
all 1
with 1
men 1
and 1
not 1
with 1
parchment 1
that 1
i 1
quarrel 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
voluntarily 1
chosen 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
agent 1
of 1
the 1
government 1
how 1
shall 1
he 1
ever 1
know 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
and 1
does 1
as 1
an 1
officer 1
of 1
the 1
government 1
or 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
until 1
he 1
is 1
obliged 1
to 1
consider 1
whether 1
he 1
will 1
treat 1
me 1
his 1
neighbor 1
for 1
whom 1
he 1
has 1
respect 1
as 1
a 1
neighbor 1
and 1
well 1
disposed 1
man 1
or 1
as 1
a 1
maniac 1
and 1
disturber 1
of 1
the 1
peace 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
he 1
can 1
get 1
over 1
this 1
obstruction 1
to 1
his 1
neighborliness 1
without 1
a 1
ruder 1
and 1
more 1
impetuous 1
thought 1
or 1
speech 1
corresponding 1
with 1
his 1
action 1
i 1
know 1
this 1
well 1
that 1
if 1
one 1
thousand 1
if 1
one 1
hundred 1
if 1

whom 1
i 1
could 1

if 1
ten 1

if 1
_one_ 1
honest 1
man 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
massachusetts 1
_ceasing 1
to 1
hold 1

were 1
actually 1
to 1
withdraw 1
from 1
this 1
co 1
partnership 1
and 1
be 1
locked 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
county 1
jail 1
therefor 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
abolition 1
of 1
slavery 1
in 1
america 1
for 1
it 1
matters 1
not 1
how 1
small 1
the 1
beginning 1
may 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
what 1
is 1
once 1
well 1
done 1
is 1
done 1
forever 1
but 1
we 1
love 1
better 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
that 1
we 1
say 1
is 1
our 1
mission 1
reform 1
keeps 1
many 1
scores 1

not 1

down 1
the 1

is 1
so 1
anxious 1
to 1
foist 1
the 1
sin 1
of 1
slavery 1
upon 1
her 1

at 1

she 1
can 1
discover 1
only 1
an 1
act 1

be 1
the 1
ground 1
of 1
a 1
quarrel 1
with 1
her 1
the 1

would 1
not 1
wholly 1
waive 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
the 1
following 1
winter 1
under 1
a 1

which 1
imprisons 1
unjustly 1
the 1
true 1

for 1
a 1
just 1

also 1
a 1

the 1
proper 1

the 1
only 1
place 1

provided 1
for 1
her 1

out 1

already 1
put 1
themselves 1
out 1

it 1

the 1

his 1

find 1
them 1
on 1
that 1
separate 1

more 1
free 1

honorable 1
ground 1

the 1

places 1
those 1

_against_ 1

a 1

honor 1

any 1
think 1

the 1

is 1
stronger 1
than 1
error 1
nor 1
how 1
much 1
more 1
eloquently 1
and 1
effectively 1
he 1
can 1
combat 1
injustice 1
who 1
has 1
experienced 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
person 1
cast 1
your 1
whole 1
vote 1
not 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
paper 1
merely 1
but 1
your 1
whole 1
influence 1
a 1
minority 1
is 1
powerless 1
while 1
it 1
conforms 1
to 1
the 1
majority 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
minority 1
then 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
irresistible 1
when 1
it 1
clogs 1
by 1
its 1
whole 1
weight 1
if 1
the 1
alternative 1
is 1
to 1
keep 1
all 1
just 1
men 1
in 1
prison 1
or 1
give 1
up 1
war 1
and 1
slavery 1
the 1
state 1
will 1
not 1
hesitate 1
which 1
to 1
choose 1
if 1
a 1
thousand 1
men 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
pay 1
their 1
tax 1
bills 1
this 1
year 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
a 1
violent 1
and 1
bloody 1
measure 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
pay 1
them 1
and 1
enable 1
the 1
state 1
to 1
commit 1
violence 1
and 1
shed 1
innocent 1
blood 1
this 1
is 1
in 1
fact 1
the 1
definition 1
of 1
a 1
peaceable 1
revolution 1
if 1
any 1
such 1
is 1
possible 1
if 1
the 1
tax 1
gatherer 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
public 1
officer 1
asks 1
me 1
as 1
one 1
has 1
done 1
but 1
what 1
shall 1
i 1
do 1
my 1
answer 1
is 1
if 1
you 1
really 1
wish 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
resign 1
your 1
office 1
when 1
the 1
subject 1
has 1
refused 1
allegiance 1
and 1
the 1
officer 1
has 1
resigned 1
from 1
office 1
then 1
the 1
revolution 1
is 1
accomplished 1
but 1
even 1
suppose 1
blood 1
should 1
flow 1
is 1
there 1
not 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
blood 1
shed 1
when 1
the 1
conscience 1
is 1
wounded 1
through 1
this 1
wound 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
real 1
manhood 1
and 1
immortality 1
flow 1
out 1
and 1
he 1
bleeds 1
to 1
an 1
everlasting 1
death 1
i 1
see 1
this 1
blood 1
flowing 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
contemplated 1
the 1
imprisonment 1
of 1
the 1
offender 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
seizure 1
of 1
his 1
goods 1
though 1
both 1
will 1
serve 1
the 1
same 1
purpose 1
because 1
they 1
who 1
assert 1
the 1
purest 1
right 1
and 1
consequently 1
are 1
most 1
dangerous 1
to 1
a 1
corrupt 1
state 1
commonly 1
have 1
not 1
spent 1
much 1
time 1
in 1
accumulating 1
property 1
to 1
such 1
the 1
state 1
renders 1
comparatively 1
small 1
service 1
and 1
a 1
slight 1
tax 1
is 1
wont 1
to 1
appear 1
exorbitant 1
particularly 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
obliged 1
to 1
earn 1
it 1
by 1
special 1
labor 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
one 1
who 1
lived 1
wholly 1
without 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
money 1
the 1
state 1
itself 1
would 1
hesitate 1
to 1
demand 1
it 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
rich 1
man 1
not 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
invidious 1
comparison 1
is 1
always 1
sold 1
to 1
the 1
institution 1
which 1
makes 1
him 1
rich 1
absolutely 1
speaking 1
the 1
more 1
money 1
the 1
less 1
virtue 1
for 1
money 1
comes 1
between 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
objects 1
and 1
obtains 1
them 1
for 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
certainly 1
no 1
great 1
virtue 1
to 1
obtain 1
it 1
it 1
puts 1
to 1
rest 1
many 1
questions 1
which 1
he 1
would 1
otherwise 1
be 1
taxed 1
to 1
answer 1
while 1
the 1
only 1
new 1
question 1
which 1
it 1
puts 1
is 1
the 1
hard 1
but 1
superfluous 1
one 1
how 1
to 1
spend 1
it 1
thus 1
his 1
moral 1
ground 1
is 1
taken 1
from 1
under 1
his 1
feet 1
the 1
opportunities 1
of 1
living 1
are 1
diminished 1
in 1
proportion 1
as 1
that 1
are 1
called 1
the 1
means 1
are 1
increased 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
do 1
for 1
his 1
culture 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
rich 1
is 1
to 1
endeavor 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
those 1
schemes 1
which 1
he 1
entertained 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
poor 1
christ 1
answered 1
the 1
herodians 1
according 1
to 1
their 1
condition 1
show 1
me 1
the 1
tribute 1
money 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
one 1
took 1
a 1
penny 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
if 1
you 1
use 1
money 1
which 1
has 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
caesar 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
made 1
current 1
and 1
valuable 1
that 1
is 1
_if 1
you 1
are 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
state_ 1
and 1
gladly 1
enjoy 1
the 1
advantages 1
of 1
caesar 1
s 1
government 1
then 1
pay 1
him 1
back 1
some 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
when 1
he 1
demands 1
it 1
render 1
therefore 1
to 1
caesar 1
that 1
which 1
is 1
caesar 1
s 1
and 1
to 1
god 1
those 1
things 1
which 1
are 1
god 1
s 1
leaving 1
them 1
no 1
wiser 1
than 1
before 1
as 1
to 1
which 1
was 1
which 1
for 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
when 1
i 1
converse 1
with 1
the 1
freest 1
of 1
my 1
neighbors 1
i 1
perceive 1
that 1
whatever 1
they 1
may 1
say 1
about 1
the 1
magnitude 1
and 1
seriousness 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
and 1
their 1
regard 1
for 1
the 1
public 1
tranquillity 1
the 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
short 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
cannot 1
spare 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
the 1
existing 1
government 1
and 1
they 1
dread 1
the 1
consequences 1
to 1
their 1
property 1
and 1
families 1
of 1
disobedience 1
to 1
it 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
like 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
ever 1
rely 1
on 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
the 1
state 1
but 1
if 1
i 1
deny 1
the 1
authority 1
of 1
the 1
state 1
when 1
it 1
presents 1
its 1
tax 1
bill 1
it 1
will 1
soon 1
take 1
and 1
waste 1
all 1
my 1
property 1
and 1
so 1
harass 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
children 1
without 1
end 1
this 1
is 1
hard 1
this 1
makes 1
it 1
impossible 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
live 1
honestly 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
comfortably 1
in 1
outward 1
respects 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
worth 1
the 1
while 1
to 1
accumulate 1
property 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
go 1
again 1
you 1
must 1
hire 1
or 1
squat 1
somewhere 1
and 1
raise 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
crop 1
and 1
eat 1
that 1
soon 1
you 1
must 1
live 1
within 1
yourself 1
and 1
depend 1
upon 1
yourself 1
always 1
tucked 1
up 1
and 1
ready 1
for 1
a 1
start 1
and 1
not 1
have 1
many 1
affairs 1
a 1
man 1
may 1
grow 1
rich 1
in 1
turkey 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
in 1
all 1
respects 1
a 1
good 1
subject 1
of 1
the 1
turkish 1
government 1
confucius 1
said 1
if 1
a 1
state 1
is 1
governed 1
by 1
the 1
principles 1
of 1
reason 1
poverty 1
and 1
misery 1
are 1
subjects 1
of 1
shame 1
if 1
a 1
state 1
is 1
not 1
governed 1
by 1
the 1
principles 1
of 1

are 1
subjects 1
of 1

no 1
until 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
massachusetts 1
to 1
be 1
extended 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
some 1
distant 1
southern 1
port 1
where 1
my 1
liberty 1
is 1
endangered 1
or 1
until 1
i 1
am 1
bent 1
solely 1
on 1
building 1
up 1
an 1
estate 1
at 1
home 1
by 1
peaceful 1
enterprise 1
i 1
can 1
afford 1
to 1
refuse 1
allegiance 1
to 1
massachusetts 1
and 1
her 1
right 1
to 1
my 1
property 1
and 1
life 1
it 1
costs 1
me 1
less 1
in 1
every 1
sense 1
to 1
incur 1
the 1
penalty 1
of 1
disobedience 1
to 1
the 1
state 1
than 1
it 1
would 1
to 1
obey 1
i 1
should 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
worth 1
less 1
in 1
that 1
case 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
the 1
state 1
met 1
me 1
in 1
behalf 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
commanded 1
me 1
to 1
pay 1
a 1
certain 1
sum 1
toward 1
the 1
support 1
of 1
a 1
clergyman 1
whose 1
preaching 1
my 1
father 1
attended 1
but 1
never 1
i 1
myself 1
pay 1
it 1
said 1
or 1
be 1
locked 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
jail 1
i 1
declined 1
to 1
pay 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
another 1
man 1
saw 1
fit 1
to 1
pay 1
it 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
why 1
the 1
schoolmaster 1
should 1
be 1
taxed 1
to 1
support 1
the 1
priest 1
and 1
not 1
the 1
priest 1
the 1
schoolmaster 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
state 1
s 1
schoolmaster 1
but 1
i 1
supported 1
myself 1
by 1
voluntary 1
subscription 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
why 1
the 1
lyceum 1
should 1
not 1
present 1
its 1
tax 1
bill 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
state 1
to 1
back 1
its 1
demand 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
church 1
however 1
at 1
the 1
request 1
of 1
the 1
selectmen 1
i 1
condescended 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
such 1
statement 1
as 1
this 1
in 1
writing 1
know 1
all 1
men 1
by 1
these 1
presents 1
that 1
i 1
henry 1
thoreau 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
any 1
incorporated 1
society 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
joined 1
this 1
i 1
gave 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
clerk 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
it 1
the 1
state 1
having 1
thus 1
learned 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
that 1
church 1
has 1
never 1
made 1
a 1
like 1
demand 1
on 1
me 1
since 1
though 1
it 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
adhere 1
to 1
its 1
original 1
presumption 1
that 1
time 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
known 1
how 1
to 1
name 1
them 1
i 1
should 1
then 1
have 1
signed 1
off 1
in 1
detail 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
societies 1
which 1
i 1
never 1
signed 1
on 1
to 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
find 1
such 1
a 1
complete 1
list 1
i 1
have 1
paid 1
no 1
poll 1
tax 1
for 1
six 1
years 1
i 1
was 1
put 1
into 1
a 1
jail 1
once 1
on 1
this 1
account 1
for 1
one 1
night 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
stood 1
considering 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
solid 1
stone 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
feet 1
thick 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
iron 1
a 1
foot 1
thick 1
and 1
the 1
iron 1
grating 1
which 1
strained 1
the 1
light 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
being 1
struck 1
with 1
the 1
foolishness 1
of 1
that 1
institution 1
which 1
treated 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
mere 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
and 1
bones 1
to 1
be 1
locked 1
up 1
i 1
wondered 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
have 1
concluded 1
at 1
length 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
use 1
it 1
could 1
put 1
me 1
to 1
and 1
had 1
never 1
thought 1
to 1
avail 1
itself 1
of 1
my 1
services 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
wall 1
of 1
stone 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
townsmen 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
still 1
more 1
difficult 1
one 1
to 1
climb 1
or 1
break 1
through 1
before 1
they 1
could 1
get 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
free 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
feel 1
confined 1
and 1
the 1
walls 1
seemed 1
a 1
great 1
waste 1
of 1
stone 1
and 1
mortar 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
alone 1
of 1
all 1
my 1
townsmen 1
had 1
paid 1
my 1
tax 1
they 1
plainly 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
treat 1
me 1
but 1
behaved 1
like 1
persons 1
who 1
are 1
underbred 1
in 1
every 1
threat 1
and 1
in 1
every 1
compliment 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
blunder 1
for 1
they 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
chief 1
desire 1
was 1
to 1
stand 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
that 1
stone 1
wall 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
but 1
smile 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
industriously 1
they 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
my 1
meditations 1
which 1
followed 1
them 1
out 1
again 1
without 1
let 1
or 1
hindrance 1
and 1
_they_ 1
were 1
really 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
dangerous 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
reach 1
me 1
they 1
had 1
resolved 1
to 1
punish 1
my 1
body 1
just 1
as 1
boys 1
if 1
they 1
cannot 1
come 1
at 1
some 1
person 1
against 1
whom 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
spite 1
will 1
abuse 1
his 1
dog 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
state 1
was 1
half 1
witted 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
timid 1
as 1
a 1
lone 1
woman 1
with 1
her 1
silver 1
spoons 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
its 1
friends 1
from 1
its 1
foes 1
and 1
i 1
lost 1
all 1
my 1
remaining 1
respect 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
pitied 1
it 1
thus 1
the 1
state 1
never 1
intentionally 1
confronts 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
sense 1
intellectual 1
or 1
moral 1
but 1
only 1
his 1
body 1
his 1
senses 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
armed 1
with 1
superior 1
wit 1
or 1
honesty 1
but 1
with 1
superior 1
physical 1
strength 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
born 1
to 1
be 1
forced 1
i 1
will 1
breathe 1
after 1
my 1
own 1
fashion 1
let 1
us 1
see 1
who 1
is 1
the 1
strongest 1
what 1
force 1
has 1
a 1
multitude 1
they 1
only 1
can 1
force 1
me 1
who 1
obey 1
a 1
higher 1
law 1
than 1
i 1
they 1
force 1
me 1
to 1
become 1
like 1
themselves 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
_men_ 1
being 1
_forced_ 1
to 1
live 1
this 1
way 1
or 1
that 1
by 1
masses 1
of 1
men 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1
were 1
that 1
to 1
live 1
when 1
i 1
meet 1
a 1
government 1
which 1
says 1
to 1
me 1
your 1
money 1
or 1
your 1
life 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
be 1
in 1
haste 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
my 1
money 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
strait 1
and 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
cannot 1
help 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
help 1
itself 1
do 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
worth 1
the 1
while 1
to 1
snivel 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
responsible 1
for 1
the 1
successful 1
working 1
of 1
the 1
machinery 1
of 1
society 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
engineer 1
i 1
perceive 1
that 1
when 1
an 1
acorn 1
and 1
a 1
chestnut 1
fall 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
the 1
one 1
does 1
not 1
remain 1
inert 1
to 1
make 1
way 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
but 1
both 1
obey 1
their 1
own 1
laws 1
and 1
spring 1
and 1
grow 1
and 1
flourish 1
as 1
best 1
they 1
can 1
till 1
one 1
perchance 1
overshadows 1
and 1
destroys 1
the 1
other 1
if 1
a 1
plant 1
cannot 1
live 1
according 1
to 1
nature 1
it 1
dies 1
and 1
so 1
a 1
man 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
prison 1
was 1
novel 1
and 1
interesting 1
enough 1
the 1
prisoners 1
in 1
their 1
shirtsleeves 1
were 1
enjoying 1
a 1
chat 1
and 1
the 1
evening 1
air 1
in 1
the 1
doorway 1
when 1
i 1
entered 1
but 1
the 1
jailer 1
said 1
come 1
boys 1
it 1
is 1
time 1
to 1
lock 1
up 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
dispersed 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
their 1
steps 1
returning 1
into 1
the 1
hollow 1
apartments 1
my 1
room 1
mate 1
was 1
introduced 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
jailer 1
as 1
a 1
first 1
rate 1
fellow 1
and 1
clever 1
man 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
locked 1
he 1
showed 1
me 1
where 1
to 1
hang 1
my 1
hat 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
managed 1
matters 1
there 1
the 1
rooms 1
were 1
whitewashed 1
once 1
a 1
month 1
and 1
this 1
one 1
at 1
least 1
was 1
the 1
whitest 1
most 1
simply 1
furnished 1
and 1
probably 1
neatest 1
apartment 1
in 1
town 1
he 1
naturally 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
i 1
came 1
from 1
and 1
what 1
brought 1
me 1
there 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
in 1
my 1
turn 1
how 1
he 1
came 1
there 1
presuming 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
honest 1
man 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
world 1
goes 1
i 1
believe 1
he 1
was 1
why 1
said 1
he 1
they 1
accuse 1
me 1
of 1
burning 1
a 1
barn 1
but 1
i 1
never 1
did 1
it 1
as 1
near 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
discover 1
he 1
had 1
probably 1
gone 1
to 1
bed 1
in 1
a 1
barn 1
when 1
drunk 1
and 1
smoked 1
his 1
pipe 1
there 1
and 1
so 1
a 1
barn 1
was 1
burnt 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
reputation 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
clever 1
man 1
had 1
been 1
there 1
some 1
three 1
months 1
waiting 1
for 1
his 1
trial 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
wait 1
as 1
much 1
longer 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
domesticated 1
and 1
contented 1
since 1
he 1
got 1
his 1
board 1
for 1
nothing 1
and 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
well 1
treated 1
he 1
occupied 1
one 1
window 1
and 1
i 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
if 1
one 1
stayed 1
there 1
long 1
his 1
principal 1
business 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
i 1
had 1
soon 1
read 1
all 1
the 1
tracts 1
that 1
were 1
left 1
there 1
and 1
examined 1
where 1
former 1
prisoners 1
had 1
broken 1
out 1
and 1
where 1
a 1
grate 1
had 1
been 1
sawed 1
off 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
occupants 1
of 1
that 1
room 1
for 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
even 1
there 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
history 1
and 1
a 1
gossip 1
which 1
never 1
circulated 1
beyond 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
the 1
jail 1
probably 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
where 1
verses 1
are 1
composed 1
which 1
are 1
afterward 1
printed 1
in 1
a 1
circular 1
form 1
but 1
not 1
published 1
i 1
was 1
shown 1
quite 1
a 1
long 1
list 1
of 1
young 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
detected 1
in 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
escape 1
who 1
avenged 1
themselves 1
by 1
singing 1
them 1
i 1
pumped 1
my 1
fellow 1
prisoner 1
as 1
dry 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
for 1
fear 1
i 1
should 1
never 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
showed 1
me 1
which 1
was 1
my 1
bed 1
and 1
left 1
me 1
to 1
blow 1
out 1
the 1
lamp 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
travelling 1
into 1
a 1
far 1
country 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
expected 1
to 1
behold 1
to 1
lie 1
there 1
for 1
one 1
night 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
town 1
clock 1
strike 1
before 1
nor 1
the 1
evening 1
sounds 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
for 1
we 1
slept 1
with 1
the 1
windows 1
open 1
which 1
were 1
inside 1
the 1
grating 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
native 1
village 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
middle 1
ages 1
and 1
our 1
concord 1
was 1
turned 1
into 1
a 1
rhine 1
stream 1
and 1
visions 1
of 1
knights 1
and 1
castles 1
passed 1
before 1
me 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
voices 1
of 1
old 1
burghers 1
that 1
i 1
heard 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
i 1
was 1
an 1
involuntary 1
spectator 1
and 1
auditor 1
of 1
whatever 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
of 1
the 1
adjacent 1
village 1
inn 1
a 1
wholly 1
new 1
and 1
rare 1
experience 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
closer 1
view 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
i 1
was 1
fairly 1
inside 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
never 1
had 1
seen 1
its 1
institutions 1
before 1
this 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
its 1
peculiar 1
institutions 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
shire 1
town 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
comprehend 1
what 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
were 1
about 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
our 1
breakfasts 1
were 1
put 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
small 1
oblong 1
square 1
tin 1
pans 1
made 1
to 1
fit 1
and 1
holding 1
a 1
pint 1
of 1
chocolate 1
with 1
brown 1
bread 1
and 1
an 1
iron 1
spoon 1
when 1
they 1
called 1
for 1
the 1
vessels 1
again 1
i 1
was 1
green 1
enough 1
to 1
return 1
what 1
bread 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
but 1
my 1
comrade 1
seized 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
lay 1
that 1
up 1
for 1
lunch 1
or 1
dinner 1
soon 1
after 1
he 1
was 1
let 1
out 1
to 1
work 1
at 1
haying 1
in 1
a 1
neighboring 1
field 1
whither 1
he 1
went 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
back 1
till 1
noon 1
so 1
he 1
bade 1
me 1
good 1
day 1
saying 1
that 1
he 1
doubted 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
see 1
me 1
again 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
prison 1
for 1
some 1
one 1
interfered 1
and 1
paid 1
that 1
tax 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
perceive 1
that 1
great 1
changes 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
on 1
the 1
common 1
such 1
as 1
he 1
observed 1
who 1
went 1
in 1
a 1
youth 1
and 1
emerged 1
a 1
gray 1
headed 1
man 1
and 1
yet 1
a 1
change 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
come 1
over 1
the 1
scene 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
state 1
and 1
country 1
greater 1
than 1
any 1
that 1
mere 1
time 1
could 1
effect 1
i 1
saw 1
yet 1
more 1
distinctly 1
the 1
state 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
lived 1
i 1
saw 1
to 1
what 1
extent 1
the 1
people 1
among 1
whom 1
i 1
lived 1
could 1
be 1
trusted 1
as 1
good 1
neighbors 1
and 1
friends 1
that 1
their 1
friendship 1
was 1
for 1
summer 1
weather 1
only 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
greatly 1
propose 1
to 1
do 1
right 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
distinct 1
race 1
from 1
me 1
by 1
their 1
prejudices 1
and 1
superstitions 1
as 1
the 1
chinamen 1
and 1
malays 1
are 1
that 1
in 1
their 1
sacrifices 1
to 1
humanity 1
they 1
ran 1
no 1
risks 1
not 1
even 1
to 1
their 1
property 1
that 1
after 1
all 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
so 1
noble 1
but 1
they 1
treated 1
the 1
thief 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
treated 1
them 1
and 1
hoped 1
by 1
a 1
certain 1
outward 1
observance 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
prayers 1
and 1
by 1
walking 1
in 1
a 1
particular 1
straight 1
though 1
useless 1
path 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
to 1
save 1
their 1
souls 1
this 1
may 1
be 1
to 1
judge 1
my 1
neighbors 1
harshly 1
for 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
not 1
aware 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
such 1
an 1
institution 1
as 1
the 1
jail 1
in 1
their 1
village 1
it 1
was 1
formerly 1
the 1
custom 1
in 1
our 1
village 1
when 1
a 1
poor 1
debtor 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
jail 1
for 1
his 1
acquaintances 1
to 1
salute 1
him 1
looking 1
through 1
their 1
fingers 1
which 1
were 1
crossed 1
to 1
represent 1
the 1
jail 1
window 1
how 1
do 1
ye 1
do 1
my 1
neighbors 1
did 1
not 1
thus 1
salute 1
me 1
but 1
first 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
returned 1
from 1
a 1
long 1
journey 1
i 1
was 1
put 1
into 1
jail 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
shoemaker 1
s 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
shoe 1
which 1
was 1
mended 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
let 1
out 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
i 1
proceeded 1
to 1
finish 1
my 1
errand 1
and 1
having 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
mended 1
shoe 1
joined 1
a 1
huckleberry 1
party 1
who 1
were 1
impatient 1
to 1
put 1
themselves 1
under 1
my 1
conduct 1
and 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
for 1
the 1
horse 1
was 1
soon 1
tackled 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
huckleberry 1
field 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
highest 1
hills 1
two 1
miles 1
off 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
state 1
was 1
nowhere 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
whole 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
prisons 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
declined 1
paying 1
the 1
highway 1
tax 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
as 1
desirous 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
good 1
neighbor 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
bad 1
subject 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
supporting 1
schools 1
i 1
am 1
doing 1
my 1
part 1
to 1
educate 1
my 1
fellow 1
countrymen 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
no 1
particular 1
item 1
in 1
the 1
tax 1
bill 1
that 1
i 1
refuse 1
to 1
pay 1
it 1
i 1
simply 1
wish 1
to 1
refuse 1
allegiance 1
to 1
the 1
state 1
to 1
withdraw 1
and 1
stand 1
aloof 1
from 1
it 1
effectually 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
care 1
to 1
trace 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
my 1
dollar 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
till 1
it 1
buys 1
a 1
man 1
or 1
a 1
musket 1
to 1
shoot 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
dollar 1
is 1
innocent 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
concerned 1
to 1
trace 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
my 1
allegiance 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
quietly 1
declare 1
war 1
with 1
the 1
state 1
after 1
my 1
fashion 1
though 1
i 1
will 1
still 1
make 1
use 1
and 1
get 1
what 1
advantages 1
of 1
her 1
i 1
can 1
as 1
is 1
usual 1
in 1
such 1
cases 1
if 1
others 1
pay 1
the 1
tax 1
which 1
is 1
demanded 1
of 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
sympathy 1
with 1
the 1
state 1
they 1
do 1
but 1
what 1
they 1
have 1
already 1
done 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
case 1
or 1
rather 1
they 1
abet 1
injustice 1
to 1
a 1
greater 1
extent 1
than 1
the 1
state 1
requires 1
if 1
they 1
pay 1
the 1
tax 1
from 1
a 1
mistaken 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
individual 1
taxed 1
to 1
save 1
his 1
property 1
or 1
prevent 1
his 1
going 1
to 1
jail 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
considered 1
wisely 1
how 1
far 1
they 1
let 1
their 1
private 1
feelings 1
interfere 1
with 1
the 1
public 1
good 1
this 1
then 1
is 1
my 1
position 1
at 1
present 1
but 1
one 1
cannot 1
be 1
too 1
much 1
on 1
his 1
guard 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
case 1
lest 1
his 1
actions 1
be 1
biased 1
by 1
obstinacy 1
or 1
an 1
undue 1
regard 1
for 1
the 1
opinions 1
of 1
men 1
let 1
him 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
does 1
only 1
what 1
belongs 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
hour 1
i 1
think 1
sometimes 1
why 1
this 1
people 1
mean 1
well 1
they 1
are 1
only 1
ignorant 1
they 1
would 1
do 1
better 1
if 1
they 1
knew 1
how 1
why 1
give 1
your 1
neighbors 1
this 1
pain 1
to 1
treat 1
you 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
inclined 1
to 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
again 1
this 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
do 1
as 1
they 1
do 1
or 1
permit 1
others 1
to 1
suffer 1
much 1
greater 1
pain 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
kind 1
again 1
i 1
sometimes 1
say 1
to 1
myself 1
when 1
many 1
millions 1
of 1
men 1
without 1
heat 1
without 1
ill 1
will 1
without 1
personal 1
feelings 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
demand 1
of 1
you 1
a 1
few 1
shillings 1
only 1
without 1
the 1
possibility 1
such 1
is 1
their 1
constitution 1
of 1
retracting 1
or 1
altering 1
their 1
present 1
demand 1
and 1
without 1
the 1
possibility 1
on 1
your 1
side 1
of 1
appeal 1
to 1
any 1
other 1
millions 1
why 1
expose 1
yourself 1
to 1
this 1
overwhelming 1
brute 1
force 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
resist 1
cold 1
and 1
hunger 1
the 1
winds 1
and 1
the 1
waves 1
thus 1
obstinately 1
you 1
quietly 1
submit 1
to 1
a 1
thousand 1
similar 1
necessities 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
put 1
your 1
head 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
but 1
just 1
in 1
proportion 1
as 1
i 1
regard 1
this 1
as 1
not 1
wholly 1
a 1
brute 1
force 1
but 1
partly 1
a 1
human 1
force 1
and 1
consider 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
relations 1
to 1
those 1
millions 1
as 1
to 1
so 1
many 1
millions 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
not 1
of 1
mere 1
brute 1
or 1
inanimate 1
things 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
appeal 1
is 1
possible 1
first 1
and 1
instantaneously 1
from 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
maker 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
secondly 1
from 1
them 1
to 1
themselves 1
but 1
if 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
head 1
deliberately 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
appeal 1
to 1
fire 1
or 1
to 1
the 1
maker 1
of 1
fire 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
myself 1
to 1
blame 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
convince 1
myself 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
any 1
right 1
to 1
be 1
satisfied 1
with 1
men 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
to 1
treat 1
them 1
accordingly 1
and 1
not 1
according 1
in 1
some 1
respects 1
to 1
my 1
requisitions 1
and 1
expectations 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
and 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
then 1
like 1
a 1
good 1
mussulman 1
and 1
fatalist 1
i 1
should 1
endeavor 1
to 1
be 1
satisfied 1
with 1
things 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
god 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
there 1
is 1
this 1
difference 1
between 1
resisting 1
this 1
and 1
a 1
purely 1
brute 1
or 1
natural 1
force 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
resist 1
this 1
with 1
some 1
effect 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1
expect 1
like 1
orpheus 1
to 1
change 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
rocks 1
and 1
trees 1
and 1
beasts 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
quarrel 1
with 1
any 1
man 1
or 1
nation 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
split 1
hairs 1
to 1
make 1
fine 1
distinctions 1
or 1
set 1
myself 1
up 1
as 1
better 1
than 1
my 1
neighbors 1
i 1
seek 1
rather 1
i 1
may 1
say 1
even 1
an 1
excuse 1
for 1
conforming 1
to 1
the 1
laws 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
i 1
am 1
but 1
too 1
ready 1
to 1
conform 1
to 1
them 1
indeed 1
i 1
have 1
reason 1
to 1
suspect 1
myself 1
on 1
this 1
head 1
and 1
each 1
year 1
as 1
the 1
tax 1
gatherer 1
comes 1
round 1
i 1
find 1
myself 1
disposed 1
to 1
review 1
the 1
acts 1
and 1
position 1
of 1
the 1
general 1
and 1
state 1
governments 1
and 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
to 1
discover 1
a 1
pretext 1
for 1
conformity 1
we 1
must 1
affect 1
our 1
country 1
as 1
our 1
parents 1
and 1
if 1
at 1
any 1
time 1
we 1
alienate 1
our 1
love 1
or 1
industry 1
from 1
doing 1
it 1
honor 1
we 1
must 1
respect 1
effects 1
and 1
teach 1
the 1
soul 1
matter 1
of 1
conscience 1
and 1
religion 1
and 1
not 1
desire 1
of 1
rule 1
or 1
benefit 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
state 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
take 1
all 1
my 1
work 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
no 1
better 1
patriot 1
than 1
my 1
fellow 1
countrymen 1
seen 1
from 1
a 1
lower 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
the 1
constitution 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
faults 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
the 1
law 1
and 1
the 1
courts 1
are 1
very 1
respectable 1
even 1
this 1
state 1
and 1
this 1
american 1
government 1
are 1
in 1
many 1
respects 1
very 1
admirable 1
and 1
rare 1
things 1
to 1
be 1
thankful 1
for 1
such 1
as 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
have 1
described 1
them 1
seen 1
from 1
a 1
higher 1
still 1
and 1
the 1
highest 1
who 1
shall 1
say 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
or 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
worth 1
looking 1
at 1
or 1
thinking 1
of 1
at 1
all 1
however 1
the 1
government 1
does 1
not 1
concern 1
me 1
much 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
bestow 1
the 1
fewest 1
possible 1
thoughts 1
on 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
many 1
moments 1
that 1
i 1
live 1
under 1
a 1
government 1
even 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
thought 1
free 1
fancy 1
free 1
imagination 1
free 1
that 1
which 1
_is 1
not_ 1
never 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
appearing 1
_to 1
be_ 1
to 1
him 1
unwise 1
rulers 1
or 1
reformers 1
cannot 1
fatally 1
interrupt 1
him 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
most 1
men 1
think 1
differently 1
from 1
myself 1
but 1
those 1
whose 1
lives 1
are 1
by 1
profession 1
devoted 1
to 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
these 1
or 1
kindred 1
subjects 1
content 1
me 1
as 1
little 1
as 1
any 1
statesmen 1
and 1
legislators 1
standing 1
so 1
completely 1
within 1
the 1
institution 1
never 1
distinctly 1
and 1
nakedly 1
behold 1
it 1
they 1
speak 1
of 1
moving 1
society 1
but 1
have 1
no 1
resting 1
place 1
without 1
it 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
men 1
of 1
a 1
certain 1
experience 1
and 1
discrimination 1
and 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
invented 1
ingenious 1
and 1
even 1
useful 1
systems 1
for 1
which 1
we 1
sincerely 1
thank 1
them 1
but 1
all 1
their 1
wit 1
and 1
usefulness 1
lie 1
within 1
certain 1
not 1
very 1
wide 1
limits 1
they 1
are 1
wont 1
to 1
forget 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
not 1
governed 1
by 1
policy 1
and 1
expediency 1
webster 1
never 1
goes 1
behind 1
government 1
and 1
so 1
cannot 1
speak 1
with 1
authority 1
about 1
it 1
his 1
words 1
are 1
wisdom 1
to 1
those 1
legislators 1
who 1
contemplate 1
no 1
essential 1
reform 1
in 1
the 1
existing 1
government 1
but 1
for 1
thinkers 1
and 1
those 1
who 1
legislate 1
for 1
all 1
time 1
he 1
never 1
once 1
glances 1
at 1
the 1
subject 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
serene 1
and 1
wise 1
speculations 1
on 1
this 1
theme 1
would 1
soon 1
reveal 1
the 1
limits 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
s 1
range 1
and 1
hospitality 1
yet 1
compared 1
with 1
the 1
cheap 1
professions 1
of 1
most 1
reformers 1
and 1
the 1
still 1
cheaper 1
wisdom 1
and 1
eloquence 1
of 1
politicians 1
in 1
general 1
his 1
are 1
almost 1
the 1
only 1
sensible 1
and 1
valuable 1
words 1
and 1
we 1
thank 1
heaven 1
for 1
him 1
comparatively 1
he 1
is 1
always 1
strong 1
original 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
practical 1

i 1

there 1
are 1

people 1
who 1
given 1
a 1
choice 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
a 1
drive 1
through 1
teller 1
just 1
so 1
they 1
can 1
deal 1
with 1
a 1
live 1
person 1
instead 1
of 1
a 1
machine 1

even 1
those 1
people 1
will 1
admit 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
nice 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
option 1
of 1
doing 1
things 1
for 1
yourself 1
on 1
your 1
own 1

do 1
you 1

how 1
much 1
money 1
you 1
would 1
need 1
for 1
the 1

cash 1
a 1
check 1
at 1
a 1
food 1
store 1
and 1
maybe 1
buy 1
something 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
out 1

there 1
were 1
always 1
credit 1
cards 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
do 1
that 1
anymore 1
i 1
think 1
many 1
people 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
automatic 1
teller 1
because 1
they 1
like 1
the 1
privacy 1
of 1
handling 1
their 1
own 1
business 1
without 1
having 1
to 1
explain 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
someone 1
else 1
and 1
we 1
like 1
the 1
illusion 1
of 1
having 1
access 1
to 1
our 1
own 1
account 1
anytime 1
we 1
want 1
there 1
are 1
disadvantages 1
to 1
using 1
an 1
automatic 1
teller 1
card 1
too 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
pay 1
a 1
fee 1
each 1
month 1
or 1
even 1
for 1
each 1
transaction 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
remember 1
to 1
deduct 1
those 1
fees 1
from 1
your 1
account 1
balance 1
or 1
you 1
will 1
bounce 1
checks 1
but 1
i 1
ll 1
bet 1
you 1
feel 1
pretty 1
competent 1
using 1
an 1
automatic 1
teller 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
lose 1
much 1
sleep 1
worrying 1
over 1

this 1

we 1

explain 1
those 1
there 1
is 1
actually 1
no 1
single 1
network 1
owned 1
by 1
one 1
company 1
called 1
the 1
internet 1
instead 1
many 1
medium 1
sized 1
networks 1
have 1
grown 1
together 1
to 1
create 1
a 1
phone 1

that 1
connects 1
together 1
nearly 1
a 1
million 1

you 1

some 1

there 1
are 1
more 1

ways 1
to 1

the 1

of 1
course 1
these 1
ways 1
make 1
sense 1
for 1
businesses 1
or 1
organizations 1
that 1
make 1
heavy 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
network 1
but 1
in 1
this 1
course 1
we 1
will 1
discuss 1
methods 1
that 1
cost 1
in 1
the 1
10 1
40 1
month 1
range 1
these 1
methods 1
are 1
suitable 1
for 1
exploring 1
the 1
net 1
after 1
hours 1
and 1
for 1
casual 1
use 1
we 1
will 1
provide 1
some 1
basic 1
information 1
about 1
more 1
expensive 1
methods 1
of 1
connecting 1
appendix 1

so 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
make 1
informed 1
decisions 1

your 1
networking 1
needs 1
should 1
increase 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
internetworking 1
well 1
means 1
mastering 1
a 1
whole 1
host 1
of 1
skills 1
connecting 1
two 1
computers 1
together 1
using 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
just 1
the 1
beginning 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
learn 1
methods 1
for 1
transferring 1
information 1
from 1
the 1
remote 1
computer 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
complex 1
task 1
that 1
may 1
involve 1
using 1
a 1
file 1
transfer 1
protocol 1
and 1
compression 1
techniques 1
because 1
the 1
information 1
world 1
is 1
so 1
vast 1
your 1
biggest 1
problem 1
will 1
most 1
likely 1
not 1
be 1
connecting 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
finding 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
thus 1
this 1
course 1
covers 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
mechanics 1
of 1
making 1
a 1
connection 1
and 1
transferring 1
files 1
but 1
techniques 1
for 1
locating 1
material 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
you 1
will 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
savvy 1
about 1
the 1
costs 1
of 1
different 1
connection 1
methods 1
this 1
means 1
estimating 1
whether 1
it 1
will 1
cost 1
you 1
more 1
per 1
megabyte 1
to 1
transfer 1
the 1
information 1
or 1

the 1
savings 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
the 1

is 1
staggering 1
once 1
you 1

you 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
information 1
from 1
hundreds 1
of 1
providers 1
it 1
is 1
like 1
the 1
difference 1
between 1
using 1
the 1

or 1
using 1
a 1
special 1
courier 1
for 1

you 1
write 1

you 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
address 1
the 1
envelope 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
stamp 1
on 1
you 1
can 1
write 1
anyone 1
the 1
internet 1
has 1
the 1
added 1
savings 1
that 1
any 1
communications 1
software 1
you 1
buy 1
for 1
it 1
works 1
with 1
all 1
providers 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
have 1
to 1
buy 1
or 1
customize 1
special 1
software 1
for 1
each 1

thus 1
you 1
can 1
use 1
one 1
familiar 1
graphical 1
user 1
interface 1
windows 1
program 1
to 1
connect 1
with 1
any 1
computer 1
the 1
usual 1
situation 1
where 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
buy 1
a 1
special 1
client 1
program 1
to 1
connect 1
to 1
each 1
kind 1
of 1
server 1
is 1
replaced 1
with 1
a 1
situation 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
single 1
program 1
that 1
any 1
server 1
out 1
there 1
has 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
this 1
standardization 1
is 1
the 1
main 1
advantage 1
of 1
using 1
the 1
internet 1
bulletin 1
boards 1
are 1
still 1
around 1
in 1
fact 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
easiest 1
ways 1
to 1
connect 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
through 1
a 1
national 1
bulletin 1
board 1
service 1
one 1
disadvantage 1
of 1
this 1
method 1
is 1
that 1
as 1
of 1
this 1
writing 1

you 1
can 1
t 1

them 1
and 1
they 1
often 1
charge 1
per 1
message 1
for 1
e 1

so 1
using 1
them 1
can 1
be 1
quite 1
expensive 1
there 1
are 1
better 1
ways 1

the 1
internet 1
the 1
best 1
way 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
the 1

is 1
as 1
a 1

can 1
send 1
a 1
any 1
written 1
text 1
by 1
e 1
mail 1
this 1
is 1
rather 1
like 1

having 1
it 1
arrive 1
in 1
seconds 1
three 1
days 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
backwards 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
using 1
a 1
special 1
protocol 1
called 1

protocol 1
you 1
can 1
transfer 1

that 1
are 1
too 1
long 1

over 1
about 1
50 1

even 1
transfer 1
graphics 1

is 1
the 1
equivalent 1
of 1
talking 1

a 1
person 1
then 1
telnet 1
the 1
third 1
main 1
internet 1
service 1
is 1
equivalent 1
to 1
telephoning 1
a 1
computer 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
the 1

this 1
chapter 1
puts 1
the 1
internet 1
into 1
context 1
rather 1
than 1
concentrating 1
on 1
the 1
trees 1
that 1
will 1
occupy 1
us 1
in 1
later 1
chapters 1
it 1
paints 1
a 1
big 1
picture 1
of 1
the 1
computing 1
world 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
internet 1
has 1
evolved 1
when 1
you 1

up 1

you 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
idea 1
of 1
what 1
might 1
possibly 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
other 1

a 1
great 1

their 1
various 1
intricacies 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
new 1
to 1
the 1

some 1
sense 1
of 1
what 1
s 1
out 1
there 1
in 1
this 1
new 1
world 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
avoid 1
getting 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
thickets 1
of 1
acronyms 1
numbers 1
and 1
procedures 1
developed 1
by 1
different 1

the 1
difference 1
between 1

and 1
the 1

rapidly 1
becoming 1

the 1

literate 1
public 1
are 1
on 1
the 1

there 1
are 1
three 1
reasons 1
that 1
using 1
the 1
internet 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
can 1
be 1
rather 1
intimidating 1
even 1
though 1
it 1
is 1
actually 1
rather 1
simple 1
to 1
use 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
nitty 1
gritty 1
of 1
internetworking 1
o 1
getting 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1
can 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
bit 1
complicated 1
o 1
the 1
capability 1
of 1
logging 1
on 1
to 1
computers 1
you 1
ve 1
never 1
used 1
before 1
by 1
its 1
very 1
nature 1
means 1
facing 1
unfamiliar 1
and 1
hence 1
uncomfortable 1
situations 1
and 1
o 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
big 1
place 1
i 1
like 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
problem 1
getting 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1
by 1
remembering 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
using 1
an 1
alternative 1
long 1
distance 1
service 1
before 1
the 1
breakup 1
of 1
the 1
bell 1
monopoly 1
people 1
who 1
used 1
the 1
alternative 1
carriers 1
had 1
to 1
dial 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
access 1
codes 1
very 1
often 1
a 1
local 1
access 1
number 1
a 1
credit 1
card 1
number 1
a 1
security 1
code 1
and 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
the 1
party 1
they 1
were 1
calling 1
they 1
knew 1
that 1
whatever 1
came 1
after 1
that 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
easier 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
getting 1
on 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
like 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
dial 1
a 1
local 1
access 1
number 1
get 1
your 1
modem 1
settings 1
right 1
and 1
type 1
the 1
right 1
magic 1
combination 1
of 1
words 1
but 1
after 1
all 1
that 1
actually 1
using 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
simple 1
we 1
ll 1
talk 1
you 1
through 1
the 1
initial 1
steps 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
some 1
frustration 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
as 1
unconscious 1
as 1
unlocking 1
your 1
front 1
door 1
or 1
tuning 1
a 1
television 1
set 1
the 1
second 1
problem 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
substantial 1
using 1
the 1
internet 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
yourself 1
into 1
situations 1
that 1
are 1
well 1
experimental 1
because 1
the 1
internet 1
gives 1
you 1
the 1
freedom 1
to 1
go 1
anywhere 1
and 1
do 1
anything 1
at 1
least 1
if 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
passwords 1
you 1
can 1
uncover 1
strange 1
incompatibilities 1
and 1
unfamiliar 1
systems 1
i 1
call 1
this 1
experience 1
shell 1
shock 1
at 1
some 1
point 1
you 1
will 1
likely 1
find 1
yourself 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
a 1
computer 1
program 1
that 1
expects 1
you 1
to 1
type 1
a 1
command 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
happen 1
to 1
know 1
you 1
can 1
mostly 1
avoid 1
such 1
situations 1
by 1
only 1
trying 1
things 1
about 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
good 1
information 1
the 1
situation 1
is 1
not 1
much 1
different 1
from 1
using 1
a 1
telephone 1
if 1
you 1
stick 1
to 1
well 1
worn 1
paths 1
like 1
dialing 1
local 1
numbers 1
or 1
simple 1
long 1
distance 1
calls 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
little 1
trouble 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
start 1
dialing 1
other 1
countries 1
or 1
special 1
numbers 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
in 1
for 1
a 1
surprise 1
or 1
two 1
when 1
you 1
do 1
log 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
new 1
previously 1
unknown 1
computer 1
you 1
can 1
expect 1
to 1
come 1
face 1
to 1
face 1

indeed 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
place 1
when 1
using 1
the 1

you 1
have 1
to 1
decide 1

what 1
information 1
you 1
want 1

where 1
it 1
might 1
be 1

o 1
how 1

these 1
are 1
hard 1
decisions 1
often 1
the 1
only 1
strategy 1

the 1
neat 1
picture 1
of 1
three 1

is 1
distorted 1
somewhat 1
by 1
a 1
tendency 1
for 1
each 1
of 1
the 1
worlds 1
to 1
have 1
two 1

options 1
either 1
in 1
choice 1
of 1
equipment 1
operating 1

so 1
for 1
example 1
the 1
pc 1
world 1
is 1
split 1
into 1
two 1
camps 1
the 1
ms 1

similarly 1
the 1

the 1
three 1
worlds 1
are 1
reflected 1
somewhat 1
in 1
networking 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
dominated 1
by 1
minicomputers 1
and 1
workstations 1
running 1
unix 1
and 1
vms 1
with 1
an 1
ever 1
increasing 1
influx 1

pcs 1
running 1
ms 1

and 1
macs 1
machines 1
running 1
other 1
operating 1
systems 1
often 1
put 1
a 1
unix 1
like 1
foot 1
forward 1
so 1
the 1
user 1
can 1
almost 1
believe 1
he 1
or 1
she 1
is 1
dealing 1
with 1
unix 1
machines 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
certain 1
sense 1
that 1
the 1
unix 1
software 1
is 1
the 1
standard 1
for 1
the 1
internet 1
software 1
tends 1
to 1
appear 1
on 1
unix 1
machines 1
first 1
and 1
then 1
be 1
ported 1
to 1
other 1
machines 1
what 1
makes 1
it 1
possible 1
for 1
all 1
these 1
disparate 1
machines 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
is 1
the 1
internet 1
protocol 1
known 1
more 1
formally 1
as 1
tcp 1
ip 1
for 1
transport 1
control 1
protocol 1
internet 1
protocol 1
tcp 1
ip 1
can 1
be 1
thought 1
of 1
as 1
a 1
set 1
of 1
rules 1
for 1
two 1
computers 1
to 1
use 1
when 1
they 1
communicate 1
with 1
each 1
other 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
vendor 1
we 1
are 1
used 1
to 1
thinking 1
of 1
computer 1
systems 1
as 1
having 1
software 1
and 1
hardware 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
truth 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
complicated 1
systems 1
like 1
the 1
internet 1
have 1
many 1
levels 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
internet 1
as 1
many 1
as 1
seven 1
ranging 1
from 1
very 1
software 1
to 1
very 1
hardware 1
each 1
level 1
has 1
its 1
own 1
set 1
of 1
rules 1
called 1
its 1
protocol 1
the 1
tcp 1
ip 1
protocol 1
belongs 1
to 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
middle 1
levels 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
the 1
most 1
common 1
protocol 1
for 1
the 1
two 1
most 1
very 1
hardware 1
levels 1
is 1
ethernet 1
looks 1
rather 1
like 1
the 1
coaxial 1
cable 1
used 1
for 1
cable 1
tv 1
while 1
the 1
very 1
software 1
levels 1
are 1
completely 1
dependent 1
on 1
the 1
vendor 1
in 1
fact 1
it 1
is 1
this 1
profusion 1
of 1
levels 1
which 1
lets 1
the 1
internet 1
work 1
on 1
just 1
about 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
hardware 1
and 1
with 1
software 1
from 1
many 1
different 1
vendors 1
anyway 1
the 1
internet 1
grew 1
up 1
as 1
several 1
medium 1
sized 1
networks 1
all 1
having 1
diffent 1
very 1
hardware 1
and 1
very 1
software 1
but 1
using 1
the 1
tcp 1
ip 1
protocol 1
for 1
their 1
middle 1
layers 1
were 1
connected 1

intellegently 1
choose 1
a 1

3 1
1 1
connection 1
methods 1
in 1
theory 1
there 1
are 1
three 1
ways 1
to 1
connect 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1
from 1
a 1
personal 1
computer 1
or 1
workstation 1
1 1
your 1
pc 1
may 1
have 1
a 1
direct 1
connection 1
this 1
means 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
local 1
area 1
network 1
lan 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
turn 1
connected 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
component 1
wide 1
area 1
networks 1
of 1
the 1
internet 1
your 1
computer 1
will 1
have 1
its 1
own 1
internet 1
protocol 1
ip 1
address 1
this 1
type 1
of 1
connection 1
is 1
common 1
in 1
offices 1
especially 1
of 1
high 1
tech 1
firms 1
but 1
definitely 1
not 1
for 1
home 1
use 1
2 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
a 1
connection 1
to 1
a 1
host 1
computer 1
that 1
is 1
directly 1
connected 1
to 1
the 1
net 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
use 1
a 1
modem 1
to 1
connect 1
your 1
home 1
pc 1
to 1
the 1
mainframe 1
at 1
the 1
office 1
and 1
the 1
mainframe 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
net 1
then 1
you 1
can 1
get 1
an 1
internet 1
connection 1
that 1
way 1
but 1
what 1
if 1
your 1
office 1
doesn 1
t 1
have 1
a 1
mainframe 1
on 1
the 1
net 1
you 1
can 1
still 1
subscribe 1
to 1
a 1
service 1
that 1
makes 1
a 1
host 1
computer 1
available 1
to 1
the 1
public 1
this 1
is 1
presently 1
the 1
cheapest 1
and 1
most 1
common 1
method 1
for 1
public 1
access 1
to 1
the 1
net 1
3 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
connection 1
method 1
in 1
between 1
cases 1
1 1
and 1
2 1
called 1
a 1
serial 1
line 1
internet 1
protocol 1
slip 1
connection 1
you 1
dial 1
up 1
a 1
special 1
host 1
computer 1
just 1
like 1
case 1
2 1
called 1
a 1
slip 1
server 1
the 1
difference 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
slip 1
server 1
gives 1
you 1
a 1
temporary 1
ip 1
address 1
and 1
talks 1
to 1
your 1
computer 1
using 1
the 1
internet 1
protocol 1
this 1
requires 1
your 1
computer 1
s 1
software 1
to 1
speak 1
slip 1
your 1
computer 1
thinks 1
it 1
is 1
using 1
case 1
1 1
even 1
though 1
your 1
actual 1
connection 1
is 1
closer 1
to 1
step 1
2 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
fooling 1
your 1
terminal 1
into 1
thinking 1
it 1
has 1
a 1
direct 1
connection 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
can 1
use 1
all 1
the 1
fancy 1
free 1
software 1
developed 1
for 1
computers 1
with 1
direct 1
connections 1
the 1
software 1
for 1
a 1
slip 1
connection 1
is 1
being 1
built 1
into 1
all 1
new 1
communications 1
software 1
if 1
you 1
just 1
bought 1
or 1
upgraded 1
your 1
software 1
you 1
probably 1
have 1
slip 1
capability 1
already 1
the 1
catch 1
slip 1
is 1
too 1
slow 1
on 1
a 1
cheap 1
2400 1
baud 1
modem 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
buy 1
a 1
fast 1
fax 1
modem 1
it 1
works 1
fine 1
that 1
s 1
one 1
reason 1
that 1
a 1
350 1
fax 1
modem 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
investment 1
it 1
is 1
fast 1
enough 1
for 1
slip 1
and 1
gives 1
you 1
the 1
ability 1
to 1
send 1
and 1
receive 1
faxes 1
as 1
well 1
slip 1
technology 1
is 1
still 1
rather 1
new 1
and 1
somewhat 1
experimental 1
so 1
this 1
discussion 1
will 1
focus 1
on 1
the 1
old 1
reliable 1
method 1
2 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
find 1
a 1
service 1
that 1
will 1
give 1
the 1
public 1
access 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1
depending 1
on 1
where 1
you 1
live 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
a 1
provider 1
you 1
can 1
call 1
in 1
your 1
local 1
area 1
code 1
if 1
not 1
then 1
most 1
of 1
your 1
problem 1
will 1
be 1
finding 1
the 1
cheapest 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
long 1
distance 1
phone 1
call 1
this 1
book 1
does 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
list 1
of 1
providers 1
since 1
such 1
a 1
list 1
will 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
date 1
rapidly 1
instead 1
it 1
gives 1
you 1
one 1
cheap 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
on 1
the 1
internet 1
then 1
gives 1
you 1
instructions 1
on 1
how 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
who 1
the 1
providers 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
their 1
rates 1
are 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
teach 1
you 1
how 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
yourself 1
than 1
just 1
give 1
you 1
some 1
outdated 1
advice 1
this 1
method 1
also 1
has 1
the 1
advantage 1
that 1
one 1
set 1
of 1
instructions 1
works 1
for 1
everybody 1
that 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
true 1
if 1
i 1
listed 1
20 1
or 1
30 1
providers 1
instructions 1
are 1
given 1
in 1
gettin 1
on 1
the 1
internet 1
step 1
by 1
step 1
section 1
3 1
2 1
types 1
of 1
internet 1
providers 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
problem 1
of 1
getting 1
on 1
the 1
net 1
occurs 1
when 1
you 1
live 1
in 1
an 1
area 1
that 1
doesn 1
t 1
have 1
a 1
local 1
provider 1
basically 1
there 1
are 1
three 1
kinds 1
of 1
providers 1
and 1
three 1
ways 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
them 1
1 1
providers 1
of 1
direct 1
connections 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
setting 1
up 1
a 1
business 1
and 1
need 1
a 1
high 1
volume 1
direct 1
connection 1
for 1
your 1
office 1
local 1
area 1
network 1
and 1
can 1
afford 1
several 1
thousand 1
a 1
year 1
at 1
least 1
you 1
will 1
want 1
to 1
consider 1
these 1
high 1
end 1
providers 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
relevant 1
to 1
our 1
discussion 1
but 1
see 1
appendix 1
c 1
for 1
more 1
information 1
2 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
regional 1
networks 1
and 1
one 1
national 1
one 1
that 1
specialize 1
in 1
low 1
cost 1
pc 1
to 1
host 1
or 1
slip 1
connections 1
costs 1
range 1
from 1
20 1
40 1
a 1
month 1
to 1
2000 1
a 1

depending 1
on 1
the 1
services 1
you 1
need 1
performance 1

international 1
psi 1
is 1
a 1
major 1
provider 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
service 1
other 1
networks 1
offer 1
services 1
similar 1
to 1
psi 1
although 1
psi 1
has 1
the 1
most 1
extensive 1
nationwide 1
service 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
this 1
service 1
can 1
be 1
very 1
competitive 1
with 1
bbs 1
type 1
service 1
see 1
below 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
frequent 1

a 1

away 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
contend 1
with 1
long 1
distance 1
charges 1
actually 1
these 1
can 1
be 1
as 1
low 1
as 1

there 1

three 1
basic 1
methods 1
of 1
paying 1

long 1

1 1
you 1
just 1
pay 1
for 1
a 1
call 1

another 1
area 1
code 1
this 1
is 1
very 1
expensive 1
and 1
not 1
recommended 1
2 1
you 1
use 1
a 1
provider 1
with 1
a 1
toll 1

pay 1
for 1
the 1

higher 1

this 1

who 1
pays 1
for 1
the 1
internet 1
all 1
this 1
talk 1
of 1
cost 1
may 1
be 1
making 1
you 1
edgy 1
eventually 1
everyone 1
using 1
the 1
internet 1
must 1
face 1
the 1
fear 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
calling 1
up 1
a 1
computer 1
in 1
switzerland 1
won 1
t 1
i 1
be 1
billed 1
for 1
the 1
call 1
the 1
marvelous 1
thing 1
about 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
that 1
although 1
there 1
is 1
plenty 1
of 1
expense 1
involved 1
in 1
getting 1
on 1
it 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
additional 1
expense 1
associated 1
with 1
what 1
you 1
do 1
after 1
you 1
are 1
connected 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
is 1
on 1
local 1
thus 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
a 1
2 1
an 1
hour 1
call 1
to 1
massachussetts 1
for 1
your 1
pc 1
your 1
modem 1
and 1
software 1
and 1
a 1
connect 1
fee 1
to 1
your 1
internet 1
provider 1
but 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
have 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
each 1
and 1
every 1
internet 1
call 1
since 1
most 1
people 1
find 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
send 1
mail 1
anywhere 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
or 1
dial 1
up 1
a 1
computer 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
globe 1
without 1
paying 1
a 1
special 1
charge 1
i 1
will 1
spend 1
some 1
time 1
explaining 1
who 1
does 1
pay 1
for 1
the 1
internet 1
and 1
how 1
those 1
costs 1
are 1
reflected 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
user 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
another 1
you 1
do 1
pay 1
for 1
network 1
usage 1
but 1
these 1
payments 1
are 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
a 1
direct 1
billing 1
for 1
each 1
call 1
first 1
you 1
already 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
internet 1
inc 1
that 1
monitors 1
all 1
the 1
calls 1
and 1
bill 1
customers 1
instead 1
there 1
are 1
hundreds 1
of 1
smaller 1
networks 1
that 1
act 1
as 1
relays 1
those 1
networks 1
could 1
charge 1
their 1
customers 1
for 1
each 1
call 1
based 1
on 1
how 1
much 1
time 1
it 1
takes 1
and 1
where 1
it 1
goes 1
but 1
since 1
no 1
one 1
is 1
charging 1
them 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
real 1
incentive 1
to 1
pass 1
on 1
costs 1
instead 1
they 1
charge 1
a 1
flat 1
fee 1
usually 1
based 1
on 1
connect 1
time 1
but 1
for 1
a 1
24 1
hour 1
connection 1
just 1
a 1
flat 1
yearly 1
fee 1
now 1
network 1
traffic 1
does 1
use 1
up 1
resources 1
basically 1
the 1
internet 1
works 1
like 1
a 1
potluck 1
supper 1
everyone 1
with 1
a 1
direct 1
connection 1
allows 1
some 1
of 1
their 1
system 1
resources 1
to 1
be 1
used 1
by 1
messages 1
that 1
are 1
just 1
passing 1
through 1
they 1
allow 1
this 1
because 1
other 1
systems 1
allow 1
them 1
the 1
same 1
privilege 1
thus 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
everyone 1
s 1
interest 1
to 1
allow 1
some 1
of 1
their 1
resources 1
to 1
be 1
consumed 1
by 1
other 1
persons 1
messages 1
because 1
everyone 1
comes 1
out 1
ahead 1
so 1
sites 1
with 1
direct 1
connections 1
pay 1
real 1
costs 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
lost 1
computing 1
cycles 1
extra 1
cabling 1
fancier 1
equipment 1
and 1
lost 1
disk 1
space 1
these 1
costs 1
are 1
passed 1
on 1
to 1
their 1
customers 1
or 1
shouldered 1
by 1
government 1
subsidy 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
direct 1
charges 1
associated 1
with 1
using 1
the 1
system 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
internet 1
government 1
subsidy 1
of 1
the 1
backbone 1
networks 1
was 1
crucial 1
the 1
backbone 1
was 1
built 1
with 1
government 1
funds 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
government 1
funds 1
that 1
paid 1
for 1
the 1
extra 1
equipment 1
needed 1
by 1
the 1
universities 1
and 1
laboratories 1
that 1
carried 1
more 1
traffic 1
than 1
they 1
generated 1
with 1
the 1
development 1
of 1
commercial 1
nets 1
alternatives 1
to 1
the 1
government 1
sponsored 1
backbone 1
arose 1
the 1
government 1
subsidy 1
is 1
still 1
important 1
but 1
becomming 1
less 1
so 1
every 1
year 1
so 1
the 1
short 1
answer 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
pay 1
for 1
the 1
network 1
you 1
either 1
pay 1
your 1
provider 1
a 1
flat 1
fee 1
or 1
you 1
pay 1
as 1
a 1
taxpayer 1
for 1
government 1
subsidized 1
network 1
resources 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
cost 1
you 1
actually 1
see 1
will 1
be 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
equipment 1
the 1
cost 1
of 1
placing 1
a 1
phone 1
call 1
and 1
whatever 1
your 1

charges 1

since 1
most 1

to 1
tell 1
the 1

it 1

very 1
common 1

not 1
worth 1

avoids 1

you 1
are 1
not 1
restricted 1

any 1

length 1
as 1
is 1
often 1
the 1
case 1
with 1
mail 1
programs 1
not 1
only 1
that 1
with 1

you 1
can 1
browse 1

even 1

are 1
often 1
compressed 1

this 1
means 1
that 1
you 1
need 1
a 1

to 1
uncompress 1

before 1
you 1
read 1

fortunately 1
you 1
can 1
usually 1
find 1
free 1
software 1
for 1
you 1

that 1
will 1
uncompress 1

conversely 1
sometimes 1
binary 1
files 1
are 1
converted 1
to 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
ascii 1
that 1
looks 1
like 1
gibberish 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
be 1
mailed 1
or 1
transferred 1
in 1
text 1
mode 1
but 1
again 1
you 1
need 1
a 1
program 1
that 1
translates 1
them 1
back 1
to 1
binary 1
sometimes 1
we 1
encounter 1
the 1
ultimate 1
absurdity 1
a 1
text 1
file 1
that 1
is 1
compressed 1
then 1
re 1
encoded 1
as 1
ascii 1
for 1
mailing 1
actually 1
this 1
makes 1
sense 1
if 1
a 1
large 1
number 1
of 1

are 1
stored 1

there 1

a 1

can 1
be 1
recognized 1

the 1
fact 1
that 1
every 1

nothing 1
above 1

below 1
them 1
often 1
a 1
uuencoded 1

is 1
split 1

several 1

for 1

advice 1
on 1
how 1
to 1

about 1
the 1
internet 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
clear 1
from 1
the 1
preceding 1
chapters 1
that 1
learning 1
how 1
to 1
use 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
a 1
survival 1
skill 1

avoids 1
circuitous 1
means 1
of 1

like 1
printing 1

faxing 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
rekeyboarding 1
the 1

at 1
the 1

or 1
not 1

documents 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
uniform 1
fashion 1
it 1
should 1
also 1
be 1
clear 1
that 1
internetworking 1
is 1
not 1
yet 1
a 1
smooth 1
easily 1
learned 1
process 1
it 1
requires 1
knowledge 1
and 1
skills 1
that 1
are 1
not 1
presently 1
taught 1
anywhere 1
except 1
on 1
the 1

specific 1
needs 1
of 1
different 1
segments 1
of 1
people 1
the 1
final 1
section 1
contains 1
a 1
fairly 1
systematic 1
exposition 1
of 1
the 1
methods 1
and 1
skills 1
needed 1
to 1
internetwork 1
effectively 1
but 1
far 1
from 1
representing 1
these 1
sections 1
as 1
the 1
last 1
word 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
stress 1
that 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
learn 1
internetworking 1
is 1
through 1
undirected 1
exploration 1
of 1
the 1
internet 1
this 1
means 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
let 1
your 1
employees 1
play 1
at 1
least 1
on 1
their 1
own 1
time 1
play 1
with 1
programs 1

with 1
anonymous 1

with 1
usenet 1
news 1
none 1
of 1
these 1
activities 1
are 1
directly 1
productive 1
but 1
the 1
playing 1
pays 1
off 1
when 1
you 1
need 1
a 1
new 1
program 1
and 1
someone 1
in 1
your 1
office 1
can 1
o 1
pick 1
the 1
right 1
usenet 1
newsgroup 1
and 1
retrieve 1
its 1
faq 1
o 1
read 1
the 1

learn 1
about 1

software 1
that 1
will 1
solve 1
your 1
problem 1

where 1

that 1

the 1

the 1

a 1
competitive 1
advantage 1
over 1

you 1

already 1
the 1

a 1

finally 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
image 1
the 1
day 1

didn 1
t 1
set 1
up 1

the 1

probably 1
can 1
t 1

nevertheless 1
rough 1
and 1
ready 1
tools 1
and 1
customs 1
have 1
grown 1
up 1
to 1
provide 1
some 1
sort 1

the 1
next 1

the 1

of 1

know 1

special 1
for 1

it 1

be 1
that 1
only 1

no 1

mailing 1
list 1

from 1

you 1
will 1

the 1
two 1
main 1
sources 1
for 1
such 1
mailing 1
lists 1
are 1
listservers 1
traditional 1
on 1
bitnet 1
and 1
increasingly 1
usenet 1
newsgroups 1
actually 1
the 1
newsgroups 1
are 1
not 1
as 1
useful 1
as 1
the 1
lists 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
for 1
the 1
humanities 1
this 1
is 1
because 1
the 1
academic 1
hierarchy 1
is 1
not 1
as 1
subdivided 1
as 1
the 1
computer 1
science 1
hierarchy 1
thus 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
whole 1
hierarchy 1
for 1
computer 1
science 1
but 1
all 1
of 1
linguistics 1
fits 1
into 1
sci 1
lang 1
these 1
discussion 1
groups 1
either 1
tend 1
to 1
have 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
participants 1
or 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
all 1
encompassing 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
useless 1
this 1
does 1
not 1
mean 1
you 1
should 1
ignore 1
usenet 1
the 1
computer 1
and 1
networking 1
information 1
is 1
invaluable 1
just 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
directly 1
relevant 1
to 1
your 1
field 1
listservers 1

another 1
matter 1
they 1
allow 1

religious 1
organizations 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
slow 1
to 1
recognize 1
the 1
importance 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
communications 1
medium 1
like 1
the 1
internet 1
many 1
religious 1
organizations 1
use 1
computers 1
for 1
producing 1
newsletters 1
or 1
accounting 1
and 1
other 1
office 1
tasks 1
but 1
very 1
few 1
use 1
them 1
effectively 1
for 1
telecommunication 1
and 1
internetworking 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
not 1
like 1
television 1
or 1
radio 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
broadcast 1
medium 1
in 1
many 1
ways 1
the 1
internet 1
is 1
a 1
more 1
appropriate 1
communications 1
medium 1
for 1
religions 1
organizations 1
than 1
the 1
media 1
it 1
is 1
less 1
expensive 1
not 1
centrally 1
controlled 1
and 1
reaches 1
persons 1
who 1
want 1
to 1
receive 1
the 1
information 1
on 1
a 1
case 1
by 1
case 1
basis 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
prevent 1
a 1
religious 1
organization 1
from 1
setting 1
up 1
a 1
fileserver 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
commercial 1
nets 1
admittedly 1
expensive 1
but 1
you 1
only 1
need 1
one 1
worldwide 1
from 1
there 1
any 1
member 1
of 1
your 1
organization 1
can 1
upload 1
and 1
download 1
information 1
thus 1
you 1
can 1
keep 1
a 1
library 1
of 1
regional 1
or 1
local 1
newsletters 1
special 1
software 1
a 1
directory 1
of 1
local 1
groups 1
listings 1
of 1
job 1
openings 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
many 1
organizations 1
already 1
have 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
on 1
bulletin 1
boards 1
but 1
ftp 1
archives 1
and 1
e 1
mail 1
provide 1
a 1
less 1
expensive 1
method 1
of 1
disseminating 1
information 1
that 1
can 1
reach 1
anywhere 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
not 1
just 1
a 1
local 1
region 1
or 1
single 1
area 1
code 1
but 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
internetworking 1
goes 1
beyond 1
the 1
office 1
environment 1
of 1
your 1
organization 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
is 1
already 1
well 1
developed 1
to 1
touch 1
your 1
educational 1

evangelical 1

you 1
can 1

and 1
its 1

instantly 1
available 1
to 1
25 1
million 1
people 1
if 1
they 1
want 1
it 1
in 1

there 1
is 1
a 1

to 1

not 1
enough 1
merely 1
to 1
sell 1
the 1

at 1
a 1
nominal 1
cost 1
unless 1
you 1
allow 1
others 1
the 1
right 1

further 1
distribute 1

it 1

not 1
really 1
free 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
sometimes 1
give 1

the 1
_kama 1

the 1

you 1

three 1
services 1
are 1
known 1
as 1
gopher 1
the 1

the 1
world 1

web 1
www 1
or 1
w3 1
all 1
three 1
services 1
are 1
based 1
on 1
client 1
server 1
technology 1
to 1
make 1
information 1
available 1
to 1
others 1
you 1
need 1
special 1
software 1
called 1
a 1
server 1
the 1
user 1
then 1
uses 1
a 1
client 1
program 1
to 1
access 1
the 1
information 1
clients 1
are 1
often 1
free 1
they 1
are 1
written 1
by 1
whoever 1
funded 1
the 1
initial 1
project 1
or 1
by 1
volunteer 1
hackers 1
the 1
catch 1
to 1
using 1
a 1
client 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
direct 1
usually 1
expensive 1
connection 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
main 1
reason 1
that 1
a 1
slip 1
connection 1
will 1
become 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
important 1
it 1
fools 1
the 1
net 1
into 1
thinking 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
direct 1
connection 1
without 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
hooking 1
your 1
computer 1
to 1
a 1
local 1
area 1
network 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
internet 1
you 1
can 1
use 1
a 1
client 1
program 1
on 1
your 1
own 1
home 1
or 1
office 1
computer 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
slip 1
connection 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
yet 1
have 1
a 1
slip 1
connection 1
they 1
re 1
still 1
a 1
bit 1
experimental 1
you 1
can 1
use 1
the 1
services 1
listed 1
here 1
as 1
of 1
this 1
writing 1
all 1
three 1
services 1
allow 1
free 1
access 1
to 1
a 1
client 1
for 1
demonstration 1
purposes 1
there 1
are 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
telnet 1
addresses 1
where 1
you 1
can 1
try 1
out 1
these 1
navigation 1
tools 1
i 1
expect 1
that 1
as 1
the 1
traffic 1
on 1
the 1
network 1
increases 1
these 1
public 1
access 1
sites 1
will 1
close 1
down 1
but 1
by 1
then 1
communications 1
programs 1
will 1
routinely 1
include 1
slip 1
and 1
probably 1
some 1
version 1
of 1
the 1
major 1
clients 1
as 1
well 1
one 1
word 1
of 1
caution 1
all 1
the 1
services 1
here 1
are 1
built 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
telnet 1
and 1
ftp 1
they 1
just 1
provide 1
a 1
different 1
and 1
perhaps 1
more 1
useful 1
way 1
of 1
making 1
internet 1
connections 1
thus 1
the 1
same 1
service 1
may 1
appear 1
in 1
several 1
guises 1
depending 1
on 1
the 1
tool 1
you 1
use 1
to 1
connect 1
to 1
it 1
there 1
are 1
also 1
gateways 1
that 1
let 1
you 1
access 1
one 1
service 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
but 1
often 1
at 1
a 1
price 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
useability 1
since 1
the 1
software 1
may 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
looking 1
at 1
say 1
a 1
gopher 1
based 1
service 1
via 1
www 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
try 1
all 1
three 1
services 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
makes 1
the 1
most 1
reliable 1
connection 1
another 1
factor 1
to 1
consider 1
is 1
that 1
unless 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
direct 1
or 1
slip 1
connection 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
limited 1
to 1
using 1
a 1
command 1
line 1
interface 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
experience 1
the 1
real 1
power 1
of 1
at 1
least 1
www 1
or 1
wais 1
nevertheless 1
they 1
are 1
useful 1
in 1
general 1
a 1
beginner 1
should 1
use 1
gopher 1
first 1
then 1
play 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
two 1
services 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
useful 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
main 1
problem 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
is 1
getting 1
the 1
information 1
you 1
find 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
client 1
program 1
this 1
is 1
difficult 1
you 1
could 1
cut 1
and 1
paste 1
the 1
information 1
from 1
your 1
screen 1
or 1
use 1
your 1
communications 1
program 1
s 1
buffer 1
to 1
store 1
it 1
wais 1
will 1
send 1
you 1
the 1
results 1
of 1
your 1
search 1
by 1
e 1
mail 1
often 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
resort 1
to 1
ftp 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
information 1
once 1
you 1
have 1
located 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
figure 1
out 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
criticisms 1
of 1
search 1
tools 1
like 1
gopher 1
or 1
wais 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
often 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
very 1
poor 1
indication 1
of 1
where 1
the 1
information 1
you 1
found 1
is 1
physically 1
located 1
this 1
is 1
especially 1
true 1
