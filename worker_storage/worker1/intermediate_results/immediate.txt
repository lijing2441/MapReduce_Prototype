we 1

to 1
be 1
self 1
evident 1
that 1
all 1
men 1
are 1
created 1

that 1
they 1
are 1
endowed 1
by 1

creator 1
with 1
certain 1
unalienable 1
rights 1
that 1
among 1
these 1
are 1
life 1

the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
happiness 1
that 1
to 1
secure 1
these 1
rights 1
governments 1
are 1
instituted 1
among 1
men 1
deriving 1
their 1
just 1
powers 1
from 1
the 1
consent 1
of 1
the 1
governed 1
that 1
whenever 1
any 1
form 1
of 1
government 1
becomes 1
destructive 1
of 1
these 1
ends 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
to 1
alter 1
or 1
to 1
abolish 1

seem 1
most 1
likely 1
to 1
effect 1
their 1
safety 1
and 1
happiness 1
prudence 1
indeed 1
will 1
dictate 1
that 1
governments 1
long 1
established 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
changed 1
for 1
light 1
and 1
transient 1
causes 1
and 1
accordingly 1
all 1
experience 1
hath 1
shown 1
that 1
mankind 1
are 1
more 1
disposed 1
to 1
suffer 1
while 1
evils 1
are 1
sufferable 1
than 1
to 1
right 1
themselves 1
by 1
abolishing 1
the 1
forms 1
to 1
which 1
they 1

accustomed 1

pursuing 1
invariably 1
the 1

evinces 1
a 1
design 1
to 1
reduce 1
them 1
under 1
absolute 1
despotism 1
it 1
is 1
their 1
right 1
it 1
is 1
their 1
duty 1
to 1
throw 1
off 1
such 1
government 1

to 1
provide 1

such 1
has 1
been 1
the 1
patient 1
sufferance 1
of 1
these 1
colonies 1
and 1
such 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
necessity 1

the 1
history 1

history 1

in 1

this 1
let 1
facts 1
be 1
submitted 1
to 1
a 1
candid 1
world 1
he 1
has 1
refused 1
his 1
assent 1
to 1
laws 1
the 1
most 1
wholesome 1
and 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
public 1
good 1
he 1
has 1
forbidden 1
his 1
governors 1
to 1
pass 1
laws 1
of 1
immediate 1
and 1
pressing 1
importance 1

suspended 1
in 1

operation 1

his 1
assent 1
should 1
be 1
obtained 1

so 1
suspended 1
he 1
has 1
utterly 1
neglected 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
them 1
he 1
has 1
refused 1
to 1
pass 1
other 1
laws 1
for 1
the 1
accommodation 1
of 1
large 1
districts 1
of 1
people 1

those 1
people 1
would 1
relinquish 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
representation 1
in 1

a 1
right 1
inestimable 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
formidable 1
to 1
tyrants 1
only 1
he 1
has 1
called 1
together 1
legislative 1
bodies 1
at 1
places 1
unusual 1
uncomfortable 1
and 1
distant 1
from 1
the 1
depository 1
of 1
their 1
public 1
records 1
for 1

sole 1
purpose 1
of 1
fatiguing 1
them 1
into 1
compliance 1
with 1
his 1
measures 1
he 1
has 1
dissolved 1
representative 1
houses 1
repeatedly 1
for 1
opposing 1
with 1
manly 1
firmness 1
his 1
invasions 1
on 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
people 1

has 1
refused 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
after 1
such 1
dissolutions 1
to 1
cause 1

to 1
be 1
elected 1
whereby 1
the 1
legislative 1
powers 1
incapable 1
of 1
annihilation 1
have 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
people 1
at 1
large 1
for 1
their 1
exercise 1
the 1
state 1
remaining 1
in 1
the 1
mean 1
time 1
exposed 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
dangers 1
of 1
invasion 1
from 1
without 1
and 1
convulsions 1
within 1
he 1
has 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
prevent 1
the 1
population 1
of 1
these 1
states 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1

refusing 1
to 1

hither 1
and 1
raising 1
the 1
conditions 1
of 1
new 1
appropriations 1
of 1
lands 1
he 1
has 1
obstructed 1
the 1
administration 1
of 1
justice 1
by 1
refusing 1
his 1
assent 1
to 1
laws 1
for 1
establishing 1
judiciary 1
powers 1
he 1
has 1
made 1
judges 1
dependent 1
on 1
his 1
will 1
alone 1
for 1
the 1
tenure 1
of 1
their 1
offices 1
and 1
the 1
amount 1
and 1
payment 1
of 1
their 1
salaries 1
he 1
has 1
erected 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
new 1
offices 1
and 1
sent 1
hither 1
swarms 1
of 1
officers 1
to 1
harass 1
our 1
people 1
and 1
eat 1
out 1
their 1
substance 1
he 1
has 1
kept 1
among 1
us 1
in 1
times 1
of 1
peace 1
standing 1
armies 1
without 1
the 1
consent 1
of 1
our 1
legislatures 1
he 1
has 1
affected 1
to 1
render 1
the 1
military 1
independent 1
of 1

superior 1
to 1
the 1
civil 1
power 1
he 1
has 1
combined 1
with 1
others 1
to 1
subject 1
us 1
to 1
a 1
jurisdiction 1
foreign 1
to 1
our 1
constitution 1
and 1
unacknowledged 1
by 1
our 1
laws 1
giving 1
his 1
assent 1
to 1
their 1
acts 1
of 1
pretended 1
legislation 1
for 1
quartering 1
large 1
bodies 1
of 1
armed 1
troops 1
among 1
us 1
for 1
protecting 1

which 1
they 1
should 1
commit 1
on 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
of 1
these 1

cutting 1
off 1
our 1
trade 1
with 1
all 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
imposing 1
taxes 1
on 1
us 1

us 1
beyond 1

to 1
be 1
tried 1

for 1
introducing 1
the 1

taking 1
away 1
our 1

valuable 1
laws 1
and 1
altering 1
fundamentally 1
the 1

brittish 1

we 1

of 1

unwarrantable 1
jurisdiction 1

reminded 1

of 1
the 1
circumstances 1
of 1
our 1
emigration 1

settlement 1
here 1
we 1
have 1
appealed 1
to 1
their 1
native 1
justice 1
and 1
magnanimity 1
and 1
we 1
have 1
conjured 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
ties 1
of 1
our 1
common 1
kindred 1
to 1
disavow 1
these 1
usurpations 1
which 1
would 1
inevitably 1
interrupt 1
our 1
connections 1

deaf 1
to 1

of 1
justice 1
and 1
of 1
consanguinity 1
we 1
must 1
therefore 1
acquiesce 1
in 1
the 1
necessity 1
which 1
denounces 1
our 1
separation 1

hold 1

more 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
these 1
lady 1
the 1
cause 1
is 1
creon 1
and 1
his 1
plots 1
jocasta 1
but 1
what 1
provoked 1
the 1
quarrel 1
make 1
this 1
clear 1
oedipus 1
he 1
points 1
me 1
out 1
as 1
laius 1
murderer 1
jocasta 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
knowledge 1
or 1
upon 1
report 1
oedipus 1
he 1
is 1
too 1
cunning 1
to 1
commit 1
himself 1
and 1
makes 1
a 1
mouthpiece 1
of 1
a 1
knavish 1
seer 1
jocasta 1
then 1
thou 1
mayest 1
ease 1
thy 1
conscience 1
on 1
that 1
score 1
listen 1
and 1
i 1
ll 1
convince 1
thee 1
that 1
no 1
man 1
hath 1
scot 1
or 1
lot 1
in 1
the 1
prophetic 1
art 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
proof 1
in 1
brief 1
an 1
oracle 1
once 1
came 1
to 1
laius 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
say 1
twas 1
from 1
the 1
delphic 1
god 1
himself 1
but 1
from 1
his 1
ministers 1
declaring 1
he 1
was 1
doomed 1
to 1
perish 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
son 1
a 1
child 1
that 1
should 1
be 1
born 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
me 1
now 1
laius 1
so 1
at 1
least 1
report 1
affirmed 1
was 1
murdered 1
on 1
a 1
day 1
by 1
highwaymen 1
no 1
natives 1
at 1
a 1
spot 1
where 1
three 1
roads 1
meet 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
child 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
three 1
days 1
old 1
when 1
laius 1
its 1
ankles 1
pierced 1
and 1
pinned 1
together 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
cast 1
away 1
by 1
others 1
on 1
the 1
trackless 1
mountain 1
side 1
so 1
then 1
apollo 1
brought 1
it 1
not 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
child 1
should 1
be 1
his 1
father 1

at 1
the 1
meeting 1
of 1

the 1
story 1
that 1

it 1
since 1
these 1
things 1

a 1
brief 1
while 1

wast 1
proclaimed 1
our 1
country 1
s 1
ruler 1
that 1
the 1
news 1

thou 1
willed 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
me 1
jocasta 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
oedipus 1
that 1
moves 1
thee 1
so 1
oedipus 1
ask 1
me 1
not 1
yet 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
build 1
and 1
height 1
of 1
laius 1
was 1
he 1
still 1
in 1
manhood 1
s 1
prime 1
jocasta 1
tall 1
was 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
hair 1
was 1
lightly 1
strewn 1
with 1
silver 1
and 1
not 1
unlike 1
thee 1
in 1
form 1
oedipus 1
o 1
woe 1
is 1
me 1
mehtinks 1
unwittingly 1
i 1
laid 1
but 1
now 1
a 1
dread 1
curse 1
on 1
myself 1
jocasta 1
what 1
say 1
st 1
thou 1
when 1
i 1
look 1
upon 1
thee 1
my 1
king 1
i 1
tremble 1
oedipus 1
tis 1
a 1
dread 1
presentiment 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
the 1
seer 1
will 1
prove 1
not 1
blind 1
one 1
further 1
question 1
to 1
resolve 1
my 1
doubt 1
jocasta 1
i 1
quail 1
but 1
ask 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
answer 1
all 1
oedipus 1
had 1
he 1
but 1
few 1
attendants 1
or 1
a 1
train 1
of 1
armed 1
retainers 1
with 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
prince 1
jocasta 1
they 1
were 1
but 1
five 1
in 1
all 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
herald 1
laius 1
in 1
a 1
mule 1
car 1
rode 1
oedipus 1
alas 1
tis 1
clear 1
as 1
noonday 1
now 1
but 1
say 1
lady 1
who 1
carried 1
this 1
report 1
to 1
thebes 1
jocasta 1
a 1
serf 1
the 1
sole 1
survivor 1
who 1
returned 1
oedipus 1
haply 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
hand 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
jocasta 1
no 1
for 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
returned 1
and 1
found 1
thee 1
reigning 1
in 1
the 1
stead 1
of 1
laius 1
slain 1
he 1
clasped 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
supplicated 1
me 1
to 1
send 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
alps 1
and 1
pastures 1
where 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
farthest 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
thebes 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
sent 1
him 1
twas 1
an 1
honest 1
slave 1
and 1
well 1
deserved 1
some 1
better 1
recompense 1
oedipus 1
fetch 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
i 1
fain 1
would 1
see 1
the 1
man 1
jocasta 1
he 1
shall 1
be 1
brought 1
but 1
wherefore 1
summon 1
him 1
oedipus 1
lady 1
i 1
fear 1
my 1
tongue 1
has 1
overrun 1
discretion 1
therefore 1
i 1
would 1
question 1
him 1
jocasta 1
well 1
he 1
shall 1
come 1
but 1
may 1
not 1
i 1
too 1
claim 1
to 1
share 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
thy 1
heart 1
my 1
king 1
oedipus 1
and 1
thou 1
shalt 1
not 1
be 1
frustrate 1
of 1
thy 1
wish 1
now 1
my 1
imaginings 1
have 1
gone 1
so 1
far 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
higher 1
claim 1
that 1
thou 1
to 1
hear 1
my 1
tale 1
of 1
dire 1
adventures 1
listen 1
then 1
my 1
sire 1
was 1
polybus 1
of 1
corinth 1
and 1
my 1
mother 1
merope 1
a 1
dorian 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
held 1
the 1
foremost 1
citizen 1
till 1
a 1
strange 1
thing 1
befell 1
me 1
strange 1
indeed 1
yet 1
scarce 1
deserving 1
all 1
the 1
heat 1
it 1
stirred 1
a 1
roisterer 1
at 1
some 1
banquet 1
flown 1
with 1
wine 1
shouted 1
thou 1
art 1
not 1
true 1
son 1
of 1
thy 1
sire 1
it 1
irked 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
stomached 1
for 1
the 1
nonce 1
the 1
insult 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
i 1
sought 1
out 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
my 1
sire 1
and 1
questioned 1
them 1
they 1
were 1
indignant 1
at 1
the 1
random 1
slur 1
cast 1
on 1
my 1
parentage 1
and 1
did 1
their 1
best 1
to 1
comfort 1
me 1
but 1
still 1
the 1
venomed 1
barb 1
rankled 1
for 1
still 1
the 1
scandal 1
spread 1
and 1
grew 1
so 1
privily 1
without 1
their 1
leave 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
delphi 1
and 1
apollo 1
sent 1
me 1
back 1
baulked 1
of 1
the 1
knowledge 1
that 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
seek 1
but 1
other 1
grievous 1
things 1
he 1
prophesied 1
woes 1
lamentations 1
mourning 1
portents 1
dire 1
to 1
wit 1
i 1
should 1
defile 1
my 1
mother 1
s 1
bed 1
and 1
raise 1
up 1
seed 1
too 1
loathsome 1
to 1
behold 1
and 1
slay 1
the 1
father 1
from 1
whose 1
loins 1
i 1
sprang 1
then 1
lady 1
thou 1
shalt 1
hear 1
the 1
very 1
truth 1
as 1
i 1
drew 1
near 1
the 1
triple 1
branching 1
roads 1
a 1
herald 1
met 1
me 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
sat 1
in 1
a 1
car 1
drawn 1
by 1
colts 1
as 1
in 1
thy 1
tale 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
himself 1
threatened 1
to 1
thrust 1
me 1
rudely 1
from 1
the 1
path 1
then 1
jostled 1
by 1
the 1
charioteer 1
in 1
wrath 1
i 1
struck 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
seeing 1
this 1
watched 1
till 1
i 1
passed 1
and 1
from 1
his 1
car 1
brought 1
down 1
full 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
the 1
double 1
pointed 1
goad 1
yet 1
was 1
i 1
quits 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
more 1
one 1
stroke 1
of 1
my 1
good 1
staff 1
sufficed 1
to 1
fling 1
him 1
clean 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
chariot 1
seat 1
and 1
laid 1
him 1
prone 1
and 1
so 1
i 1
slew 1
them 1
every 1
one 1
but 1
if 1
betwixt 1
this 1
stranger 1
there 1
was 1
aught 1
in 1
common 1
with 1
laius 1
who 1
more 1
miserable 1
than 1
i 1
what 1
mortal 1
could 1
you 1
find 1
more 1
god 1
abhorred 1
wretch 1
whom 1
no 1
sojourner 1
no 1
citizen 1
may 1
harbor 1
or 1
address 1
whom 1
all 1
are 1
bound 1
to 1
harry 1
from 1
their 1
homes 1
and 1
this 1
same 1
curse 1
was 1
laid 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
laid 1
by 1
none 1
but 1
me 1
yea 1
with 1
these 1
hands 1
all 1
gory 1
i 1
pollute 1
the 1
bed 1
of 1
him 1
i 1
slew 1
say 1
am 1
i 1
vile 1
am 1
i 1
not 1
utterly 1
unclean 1
a 1
wretch 1
doomed 1
to 1
be 1
banished 1
and 1
in 1
banishment 1
forgo 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
all 1
my 1
dearest 1
ones 1
and 1
never 1
tread 1
again 1
my 1
native 1
earth 1
or 1
else 1
to 1
wed 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
slay 1
my 1
sire 1
polybus 1
who 1
begat 1
me 1
and 1
upreared 1
if 1
one 1
should 1
say 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
handiwork 1
of 1
some 1
inhuman 1
power 1
who 1
could 1
blame 1
his 1
judgment 1
but 1
ye 1
pure 1
and 1
awful 1
gods 1
forbid 1
forbid 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
see 1
that 1
day 1
may 1
i 1
be 1
blotted 1
out 1
from 1
living 1
men 1
ere 1
such 1
a 1
plague 1
spot 1
set 1
on 1
me 1
its 1
brand 1
chorus 1
we 1
too 1
o 1
king 1
are 1
troubled 1
but 1
till 1
thou 1
hast 1
questioned 1
the 1
survivor 1
still 1
hope 1
on 1
oedipus 1
my 1
hope 1
is 1
faint 1
but 1
still 1
enough 1
survives 1
to 1
bid 1
me 1
bide 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
this 1
herd 1
jocasta 1
suppose 1
him 1
here 1
what 1
wouldst 1
thou 1
learn 1
of 1
him 1
oedipus 1
i 1
ll 1
tell 1
thee 1
lady 1
if 1
his 1
tale 1
agrees 1
with 1
thine 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
scaped 1
calamity 1
jocasta 1
and 1
what 1
of 1
special 1
import 1
did 1
i 1
say 1
oedipus 1
in 1
thy 1
report 1
of 1
what 1
the 1
herdsman 1
said 1
laius 1
was 1
slain 1
by 1
robbers 1
now 1
if 1
he 1
still 1
speaks 1
of 1
robbers 1
not 1
a 1
robber 1
i 1
slew 1
him 1
not 1
one 1
with 1
many 1
cannot 1
square 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
says 1
one 1
lonely 1
wayfarer 1
the 1
last 1
link 1
wanting 1
to 1
my 1
guilt 1
is 1
forged 1
jocasta 1
well 1
rest 1
assured 1
his 1
tale 1
ran 1
thus 1
at 1
first 1
nor 1
can 1
he 1
now 1
retract 1
what 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
not 1
i 1
alone 1
but 1
all 1
our 1
townsfolk 1
heard 1
it 1
e 1
en 1
should 1
he 1
vary 1
somewhat 1
in 1
his 1
story 1
he 1
cannot 1
make 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
laius 1
in 1
any 1
wise 1
jump 1
with 1
the 1
oracle 1
for 1
loxias 1
said 1
expressly 1
he 1
was 1
doomed 1
to 1
die 1
by 1
my 1
child 1
s 1
hand 1

he 1
poor 1

shed 1
no 1

thou 1

thee 1
i 1
beg 1
my 1

had 1
not 1

me 1
i 1
had 1
been 1

from 1
thee 1
they 1
tend 1
me 1
they 1
preserve 1
me 1
they 1
are 1
men 1
not 1
women 1
in 1
true 1
service 1
to 1

sire 1
but 1
ye 1
are 1
bastards 1

no 1

therefore 1
just 1
heaven 1
hath 1
an 1

on 1
thee 1
howbeit 1
not 1
yet 1
with 1

so 1

as 1
thou 1
shalt 1
soon 1
experience 1
if 1
indeed 1
these 1

are 1
moving 1
against 1

that 1
city 1
thou 1
canst 1
never 1
storm 1
but 1
first 1
shall 1
fall 1
thou 1
and 1
thy 1

imbrued 1
such 1
curse 1
i 1
lately 1
launched 1
against 1
you 1
twain 1
such 1
curse 1
i 1
now 1
invoke 1
to 1
fight 1
for 1
me 1
that 1
ye 1
may 1
learn 1
to 1
honor 1
those 1
who 1
bear 1
thee 1
nor 1
flout 1
a 1

father 1
who 1
begat 1
degenerate 1
sons 1
these 1
maidens 1
did 1
not 1
so 1
therefore 1
my 1
curse 1
is 1
stronger 1
than 1
thy 1

if 1

stripped 1

shook 1
the 1

closed 1

there 1
stood 1
this 1
maid 1

piercing 1
cry 1
she 1
uttered 1
sad 1

shrill 1
as 1
when 1

mother 1

beholds 1
her 1
nest 1
robbed 1
of 1
its 1

wailed 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
body 1
stripped 1
and 1
bare 1
and 1
cursed 1
the 1
ruffians 1
who 1
had 1
done 1

deed 1

down 1

her 1
and 1
seized 1
our 1
quarry 1
undismayed 1

stood 1
and 1
when 1

taxed 1
her 1
with 1

1 1
a 1
not 1
unnatural 1
enterprise 1
this 1
is 1
written 1
from 1
memory 1
unfortunately 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
brought 1
with 1
me 1
the 1
material 1
i 1
so 1
carefully 1
prepared 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
story 1
whole 1
books 1
full 1
of 1
notes 1
carefully 1
copied 1
records 1
firsthand 1
descriptions 1
and 1
the 1
pictures 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
worst 1
loss 1
we 1
had 1
some 1
bird 1
s 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
cities 1
and 1
parks 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
lovely 1
views 1
of 1
streets 1
of 1
buildings 1
outside 1
and 1
in 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
those 1
gorgeous 1
gardens 1
and 1
most 1
important 1
of 1
all 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
themselves 1
nobody 1
will 1
ever 1
believe 1
how 1
they 1
looked 1
descriptions 1
aren 1
t 1
any 1
good 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
women 1
and 1
i 1
never 1
was 1
good 1
at 1
descriptions 1
anyhow 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
somehow 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
needs 1
to 1
know 1
about 1
that 1
country 1
i 1
haven 1
t 1
said 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
fear 1
some 1
self 1
appointed 1
missionaries 1
or 1
traders 1
or 1
land 1
greedy 1
expansionists 1
will 1
take 1
it 1
upon 1
themselves 1
to 1
push 1
in 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
wanted 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
them 1
that 1
and 1
will 1
fare 1
worse 1
than 1
we 1
did 1
if 1
they 1
do 1
find 1
it 1
it 1
began 1
this 1
way 1
there 1
were 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
classmates 1
and 1
friends 1
terry 1
o 1
nicholson 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
call 1
him 1
the 1
old 1
nick 1
with 1
good 1
reason 1
jeff 1
margrave 1
and 1
i 1
vandyck 1
jennings 1
we 1
had 1
known 1
each 1
other 1
years 1
and 1
years 1
and 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
our 1
differences 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
in 1
common 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
were 1
interested 1
in 1
science 1
terry 1
was 1
rich 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
as 1
he 1
pleased 1
his 1
great 1
aim 1
was 1
exploration 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
make 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
a 1
row 1
because 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
left 1
to 1
explore 1
now 1
only 1
patchwork 1
and 1
filling 1
in 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
filled 1
in 1
well 1
enough 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
talents 1
great 1
on 1
mechanics 1
and 1
electricity 1
had 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
boats 1
and 1
motorcars 1
and 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
our 1
airmen 1
we 1
never 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
the 1
thing 1
at 1
all 1
without 1
terry 1
jeff 1
margrave 1
was 1
born 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
poet 1
a 1
botanist 1
or 1
both 1
but 1
his 1
folks 1
persuaded 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
doctor 1
instead 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
one 1
for 1
his 1
age 1
but 1
his 1
real 1
interest 1
was 1
in 1
what 1
he 1
loved 1
to 1
call 1
the 1
wonders 1
of 1
science 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
sociology 1
s 1
my 1
major 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
back 1
that 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
other 1
sciences 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
m 1
interested 1
in 1
them 1
all 1
terry 1
was 1
strong 1
on 1
facts 1
geography 1
and 1
meteorology 1
and 1
those 1
jeff 1
could 1
beat 1
him 1
any 1
time 1
on 1
biology 1
and 1
i 1
didn 1
t 1
care 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
they 1
talked 1
about 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
connected 1
with 1
human 1
life 1
somehow 1
there 1
are 1
few 1
things 1
that 1
don 1
t 1
we 1
three 1
had 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
join 1
a 1
big 1
scientific 1
expedition 1
they 1
needed 1
a 1
doctor 1
and 1
that 1
gave 1
jeff 1
an 1
excuse 1
for 1
dropping 1
his 1
just 1
opening 1
practice 1
they 1
needed 1
terry 1
s 1
experience 1
his 1
machine 1
and 1
his 1
money 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
got 1
in 1
through 1
terry 1
s 1
influence 1
the 1
expedition 1
was 1
up 1
among 1
the 1
thousand 1
tributaries 1
and 1
enormous 1
hinterland 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
river 1
up 1
where 1
the 1
maps 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
savage 1
dialects 1
studied 1
and 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
strange 1
flora 1
and 1
fauna 1
expected 1
but 1
this 1
story 1
is 1
not 1
about 1
that 1
expedition 1
that 1
was 1
only 1
the 1
merest 1
starter 1
for 1
ours 1
my 1
interest 1
was 1
first 1
roused 1
by 1
talk 1
among 1
our 1
guides 1
i 1
m 1
quick 1
at 1
languages 1
know 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
and 1
pick 1
them 1
up 1
readily 1
what 1
with 1
that 1
and 1
a 1
really 1
good 1
interpreter 1
we 1
took 1
with 1
us 1
i 1
made 1
out 1
quite 1
a 1
few 1
legends 1
and 1
folk 1
myths 1
of 1
these 1
scattered 1
tribes 1
and 1
as 1
we 1
got 1
farther 1
and 1
farther 1
upstream 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
tangle 1
of 1
rivers 1
lakes 1
morasses 1
and 1
dense 1
forests 1
with 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
an 1
unexpected 1
long 1
spur 1
running 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
big 1
mountains 1
beyond 1
i 1
noticed 1
that 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
of 1
these 1
savages 1
had 1
a 1
story 1
about 1
a 1
strange 1
and 1
terrible 1
woman 1
land 1
in 1
the 1
high 1
distance 1
up 1
yonder 1
over 1
there 1
way 1
up 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
direction 1
they 1
could 1
offer 1
but 1
their 1
legends 1
all 1
agreed 1
on 1
the 1
main 1
point 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
this 1
strange 1
country 1
where 1
no 1
men 1
lived 1
only 1
women 1
and 1
girl 1
children 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
dangerous 1
deadly 1
they 1
said 1
for 1
any 1
man 1
to 1
go 1
there 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
tales 1
of 1
long 1
ago 1
when 1
some 1
brave 1
investigator 1
had 1
seen 1
it 1
a 1
big 1
country 1
big 1
houses 1
plenty 1
people 1
all 1
women 1
had 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
gone 1
yes 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
but 1
they 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
place 1
for 1
men 1
of 1
that 1
they 1
seemed 1
sure 1
i 1
told 1
the 1
boys 1
about 1
these 1
stories 1
and 1
they 1
laughed 1
at 1
them 1
naturally 1
i 1
did 1
myself 1
i 1
knew 1
the 1
stuff 1
that 1
savage 1
dreams 1
are 1
made 1
of 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
had 1
reached 1
our 1
farthest 1
point 1
just 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
we 1
all 1
had 1
to 1
turn 1
around 1
and 1
start 1
for 1
home 1
again 1
as 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
expeditions 1
must 1
in 1
time 1
we 1
three 1
made 1
a 1
discovery 1
the 1
main 1
encampment 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
spit 1
of 1
land 1
running 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
main 1
stream 1
or 1
what 1
we 1
thought 1
was 1
the 1
main 1
stream 1
it 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
muddy 1
color 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
seeing 1
for 1
weeks 1
past 1
the 1
same 1
taste 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
that 1
river 1
to 1
our 1
last 1
guide 1
a 1
rather 1
superior 1
fellow 1
with 1
quick 1
bright 1
eyes 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
river 1
over 1
there 1
short 1
river 1
sweet 1
water 1
red 1
and 1
blue 1
i 1
was 1
interested 1
in 1
this 1
and 1
anxious 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
understood 1
so 1
i 1
showed 1
him 1
a 1
red 1
and 1
blue 1
pencil 1
i 1
carried 1
and 1
asked 1
again 1
yes 1
he 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
southwestward 1
river 1
good 1
water 1
red 1
and 1
blue 1
terry 1
was 1
close 1
by 1
and 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
fellow 1
s 1
pointing 1
what 1
does 1
he 1
say 1
van 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
terry 1
blazed 1
up 1
at 1
once 1
ask 1
him 1
how 1
far 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
man 1
indicated 1
a 1
short 1
journey 1
i 1
judged 1
about 1
two 1
hours 1
maybe 1
three 1
let 1
s 1
go 1
urged 1
terry 1
just 1
us 1
three 1
maybe 1
we 1
can 1
really 1
find 1
something 1
may 1
be 1
cinnabar 1
in 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
indigo 1
jeff 1
suggested 1
with 1
his 1
lazy 1
smile 1
it 1
was 1
early 1
yet 1
we 1
had 1
just 1
breakfasted 1
and 1
leaving 1
word 1
that 1
we 1
d 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
night 1
we 1
got 1
away 1
quietly 1
not 1
wishing 1
to 1
be 1
thought 1
too 1
gullible 1
if 1
we 1
failed 1
and 1
secretly 1
hoping 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
nice 1
little 1
discovery 1
all 1
to 1
ourselves 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
two 1
hours 1
nearer 1
three 1
i 1
fancy 1
the 1
savage 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
it 1
alone 1
much 1
quicker 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
desperate 1
tangle 1
of 1
wood 1
and 1
water 1
and 1
a 1
swampy 1
patch 1
we 1
never 1
should 1
have 1
found 1
our 1
way 1
across 1
alone 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
terry 1
with 1
compass 1
and 1
notebook 1
marking 1
directions 1
and 1
trying 1
to 1
place 1
landmarks 1
we 1
came 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
to 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
marshy 1
lake 1
very 1
big 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
circling 1
forest 1
looked 1
quite 1
low 1
and 1
dim 1
across 1
it 1
our 1
guide 1
told 1
us 1
that 1
boats 1
could 1
go 1
from 1
there 1
to 1
our 1
camp 1
but 1
long 1
way 1
all 1
day 1
this 1
water 1
was 1
somewhat 1
clearer 1
than 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
judge 1
well 1
from 1
the 1
margin 1
we 1
skirted 1
it 1
for 1
another 1
half 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
the 1
ground 1
growing 1
firmer 1
as 1
we 1
advanced 1
and 1
presently 1
we 1
turned 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
a 1
wooded 1
promontory 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
quite 1
different 1
country 1
a 1
sudden 1
view 1
of 1
mountains 1
steep 1
and 1
bare 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
long 1
easterly 1
spurs 1
terry 1
said 1
appraisingly 1
may 1
be 1
hundreds 1
of 1
miles 1
from 1
the 1
range 1
they 1
crop 1
out 1
like 1
that 1
suddenly 1
we 1
left 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
struck 1
directly 1
toward 1
the 1
cliffs 1
we 1
heard 1
running 1
water 1
before 1
we 1
reached 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
guide 1
pointed 1
proudly 1
to 1
his 1
river 1
it 1
was 1
short 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
where 1
it 1
poured 1
down 1
a 1
narrow 1
vertical 1
cataract 1
from 1
an 1
opening 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
cliff 1
it 1
was 1
sweet 1
water 1
the 1
guide 1
drank 1
eagerly 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
we 1
that 1
s 1
snow 1
water 1
terry 1
announced 1
must 1
come 1
from 1
way 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
hills 1
but 1
as 1
to 1
being 1
red 1
and 1
blue 1
it 1
was 1
greenish 1
in 1
tint 1
the 1
guide 1
seemed 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
surprised 1
he 1
hunted 1
about 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
showed 1
us 1
a 1
quiet 1
marginal 1
pool 1
where 1
there 1
were 1
smears 1
of 1
red 1
along 1
the 1
border 1
yes 1
and 1
of 1
blue 1
terry 1
got 1
out 1
his 1
magnifying 1
glass 1
and 1
squatted 1
down 1
to 1
investigate 1
chemicals 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
i 1
can 1
t 1
tell 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
look 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
dyestuffs 1
let 1
s 1
get 1
nearer 1
he 1
urged 1
up 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
fall 1
we 1
scrambled 1
along 1
the 1
steep 1
banks 1
and 1
got 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
pool 1
that 1
foamed 1
and 1
boiled 1
beneath 1
the 1
falling 1
water 1
here 1
we 1
searched 1
the 1
border 1
and 1
found 1
traces 1
of 1
color 1
beyond 1
dispute 1
more 1
jeff 1
suddenly 1
held 1
up 1
an 1
unlooked 1
for 1
trophy 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
rag 1
a 1
long 1
raveled 1
fragment 1
of 1
cloth 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
well 1
woven 1
fabric 1
with 1
a 1
pattern 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
clear 1
scarlet 1
that 1
the 1
water 1
had 1
not 1
faded 1
no 1
savage 1
tribe 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
made 1
such 1
fabrics 1
the 1
guide 1
stood 1
serenely 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
well 1
pleased 1
with 1
our 1
excitement 1
one 1
day 1
blue 1
one 1
day 1
red 1
one 1
day 1
green 1
he 1
told 1
us 1
and 1
pulled 1
from 1
his 1
pouch 1
another 1
strip 1
of 1
bright 1
hued 1
cloth 1
come 1
down 1
he 1
said 1
pointing 1
to 1
the 1
cataract 1
woman 1
country 1
up 1
there 1
then 1
we 1
were 1
interested 1
we 1
had 1
our 1
rest 1
and 1
lunch 1
right 1
there 1
and 1
pumped 1
the 1
man 1
for 1
further 1
information 1
he 1
could 1
tell 1
us 1
only 1
what 1
the 1
others 1
had 1
a 1
land 1
of 1
women 1
no 1
men 1
babies 1
but 1
all 1
girls 1
no 1
place 1
for 1
men 1
dangerous 1
some 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
see 1
none 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
terry 1
s 1
jaw 1
set 1
at 1
that 1
no 1
place 1
for 1
men 1
dangerous 1
he 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
might 1
shin 1
up 1
the 1
waterfall 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
but 1
the 1
guide 1
would 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
going 1
up 1
even 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
any 1
possible 1
method 1
of 1
scaling 1
that 1
sheer 1
cliff 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
party 1
before 1
night 1
they 1
might 1
stay 1
if 1
we 1
told 1
them 1
i 1
suggested 1
but 1
terry 1
stopped 1
in 1
his 1
tracks 1
look 1
here 1
fellows 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
is 1
our 1
find 1
let 1
s 1
not 1
tell 1
those 1
cocky 1
old 1
professors 1
let 1
s 1
go 1
on 1
home 1
with 1
em 1
and 1
then 1
come 1
back 1
just 1
us 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
expedition 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
we 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
much 1
impressed 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
attractive 1
to 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
unattached 1
young 1
men 1
in 1
finding 1
an 1
undiscovered 1
country 1
of 1
a 1
strictly 1
amazonian 1
nature 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
believe 1
the 1
story 1
but 1
yet 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
cloth 1
made 1
by 1
any 1
of 1
these 1
local 1
tribes 1
i 1
announced 1
examining 1
those 1
rags 1
with 1
great 1
care 1
somewhere 1
up 1
yonder 1
they 1
spin 1
and 1
weave 1
and 1
dye 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
we 1
do 1
that 1
would 1
mean 1
a 1
considerable 1
civilization 1
van 1
there 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
and 1
not 1
known 1
about 1
oh 1
well 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
s 1
that 1
old 1
republic 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
pyrenees 1
somewhere 1
andorra 1
precious 1
few 1
people 1
know 1
anything 1
about 1
that 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
been 1
minding 1
its 1
own 1
business 1
for 1
a 1
thousand 1
years 1
then 1
there 1
s 1
montenegro 1
splendid 1
little 1
state 1
you 1
could 1
lose 1
a 1
dozen 1
montenegroes 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
these 1
great 1
ranges 1
we 1
discussed 1
it 1
hotly 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
we 1
discussed 1
it 1
with 1
care 1
and 1
privacy 1
on 1
the 1
voyage 1
home 1
we 1
discussed 1
it 1
after 1
that 1
still 1
only 1
among 1
ourselves 1
while 1
terry 1
was 1
making 1
his 1
arrangements 1
he 1
was 1
hot 1
about 1
it 1
lucky 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
money 1
we 1
might 1
have 1
had 1
to 1
beg 1
and 1
advertise 1
for 1
years 1
to 1
start 1
the 1
thing 1
and 1
then 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
public 1
amusement 1
just 1
sport 1
for 1
the 1
papers 1
but 1
t 1
o 1
nicholson 1
could 1
fix 1
up 1
his 1
big 1
steam 1
yacht 1
load 1
his 1
specially 1
made 1
big 1
motorboat 1
aboard 1
and 1
tuck 1
in 1
a 1
dissembled 1
biplane 1
without 1
any 1
more 1
notice 1
than 1
a 1
snip 1
in 1
the 1
society 1
column 1
we 1
had 1
provisions 1
and 1
preventives 1
and 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
supplies 1
his 1
previous 1
experience 1
stood 1
him 1
in 1
good 1
stead 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
complete 1
little 1
outfit 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
yacht 1
at 1
the 1
nearest 1
safe 1
port 1
and 1
go 1
up 1
that 1
endless 1
river 1
in 1
our 1
motorboat 1
just 1
the 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
a 1
pilot 1
then 1
drop 1
the 1
pilot 1
when 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
that 1
last 1
stopping 1
place 1
of 1
the 1
previous 1
party 1
and 1
hunt 1
up 1
that 1
clear 1
water 1
stream 1
ourselves 1
the 1
motorboat 1
we 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
leave 1
at 1
anchor 1
in 1
that 1
wide 1
shallow 1
lake 1
it 1
had 1
a 1
special 1
covering 1
of 1
fitted 1
armor 1
thin 1
but 1
strong 1
shut 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
clamshell 1
those 1
natives 1
can 1
t 1
get 1
into 1
it 1
or 1
hurt 1
it 1
or 1
move 1
it 1
terry 1
explained 1
proudly 1
we 1
ll 1
start 1
our 1
flier 1
from 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
leave 1
the 1
boat 1
as 1
a 1
base 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
if 1
we 1
come 1
back 1
i 1
suggested 1
cheerfully 1
fraid 1
the 1
ladies 1
will 1
eat 1
you 1
he 1
scoffed 1
we 1
re 1
not 1
so 1
sure 1
about 1
those 1
ladies 1
you 1
know 1
drawled 1
jeff 1
there 1
may 1
be 1
a 1
contingent 1
of 1
gentlemen 1
with 1
poisoned 1
arrows 1
or 1
something 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
need 1
to 1
go 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
terry 1
remarked 1
drily 1
go 1
you 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
get 1
an 1
injunction 1
to 1
stop 1
me 1
both 1
jeff 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
sure 1
about 1
that 1
but 1
we 1
did 1
have 1
differences 1
of 1
opinion 1
all 1
the 1
long 1
way 1
an 1
ocean 1
voyage 1
is 1
an 1
excellent 1
time 1
for 1
discussion 1
now 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
eavesdroppers 1
we 1
could 1
loll 1
and 1
loaf 1
in 1
our 1
deck 1
chairs 1
and 1
talk 1
and 1
talk 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
do 1
our 1
absolute 1
lack 1
of 1
facts 1
only 1
made 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
discussion 1
wider 1
we 1
ll 1
leave 1
papers 1
with 1
our 1
consul 1
where 1
the 1
yacht 1
stays 1
terry 1
planned 1
if 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
come 1
back 1
in 1
say 1
a 1
month 1
they 1
can 1
send 1
a 1
relief 1
party 1
after 1
us 1
a 1
punitive 1
expedition 1
i 1
urged 1
if 1
the 1
ladies 1
do 1
eat 1
us 1
we 1
must 1
make 1
reprisals 1
they 1
can 1
locate 1
that 1
last 1
stopping 1
place 1
easy 1
enough 1
and 1
i 1
ve 1
made 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
chart 1
of 1
that 1
lake 1
and 1
cliff 1
and 1
waterfall 1
yes 1
but 1
how 1
will 1
they 1
get 1
up 1
asked 1
jeff 1
same 1
way 1
we 1
do 1
of 1
course 1
if 1
three 1
valuable 1
american 1
citizens 1
are 1
lost 1
up 1
there 1
they 1
will 1
follow 1
somehow 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
glittering 1
attractions 1
of 1
that 1
fair 1
land 1
let 1
s 1
call 1
it 1
feminisia 1
he 1
broke 1
off 1
you 1
re 1
right 1
terry 1
once 1
the 1
story 1
gets 1
out 1
the 1
river 1
will 1
crawl 1
with 1
expeditions 1
and 1
the 1
airships 1
rise 1
like 1
a 1
swarm 1
of 1
mosquitoes 1
i 1
laughed 1
as 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
we 1
ve 1
made 1
a 1
great 1
mistake 1
not 1
to 1
let 1
mr 1
yellow 1
press 1
in 1
on 1
this 1
save 1
us 1
what 1
headlines 1
not 1
much 1
said 1
terry 1
grimly 1
this 1
is 1
our 1
party 1
we 1
re 1
going 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
place 1
alone 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
when 1
you 1
do 1
find 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
jeff 1
asked 1
mildly 1
jeff 1
was 1
a 1
tender 1
soul 1
i 1
think 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
country 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
was 1
just 1
blossoming 1
with 1
roses 1
and 1
babies 1
and 1
canaries 1
and 1
tidies 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
and 1
terry 1
in 1
his 1
secret 1
heart 1
had 1
visions 1
of 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sublimated 1
summer 1
resort 1

girls 1
and 1
girls 1
and 1
girls 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
well 1
terry 1
was 1
popular 1
among 1
women 1
even 1
when 1
there 1
were 1
other 1
men 1
around 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
wondered 1
at 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
pleasant 1
dreams 1
of 1
what 1
might 1
happen 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
there 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
long 1
blue 1
rollers 1
slipping 1
by 1
and 1
fingering 1
that 1
impressive 1
mustache 1
of 1
his 1
but 1
i 1
thought 1
then 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
form 1
a 1
far 1
clearer 1
idea 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
before 1
us 1
than 1
either 1
of 1
them 1
you 1
re 1
all 1
off 1
boys 1
i 1
insisted 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
and 1
there 1
does 1
seem 1
some 1
foundation 1
for 1
believing 1
it 1
you 1
ll 1
find 1
it 1
s 1
built 1
on 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
matriarchal 1
principle 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
the 1
men 1
have 1
a 1
separate 1
cult 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
less 1
socially 1
developed 1
than 1
the 1
women 1
and 1
make 1
them 1
an 1
annual 1
visit 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
wedding 1
call 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
condition 1
known 1
to 1
have 1
existed 1
here 1
s 1
just 1
a 1
survival 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
some 1
peculiarly 1
isolated 1
valley 1
or 1
tableland 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
their 1
primeval 1
customs 1
have 1
survived 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
it 1
how 1
about 1
the 1
boys 1
jeff 1
asked 1
oh 1
the 1
men 1
take 1
them 1
away 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
you 1
see 1
and 1
how 1
about 1
this 1
danger 1
theory 1
all 1
our 1
guides 1
were 1
so 1
sure 1
of 1
danger 1
enough 1
terry 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
mighty 1
careful 1
women 1
of 1
that 1
stage 1
of 1
culture 1
are 1
quite 1
able 1
to 1
defend 1
themselves 1
and 1
have 1
no 1
welcome 1
for 1
unseasonable 1
visitors 1
we 1
talked 1
and 1
talked 1
and 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
airs 1
of 1
sociological 1
superiority 1
i 1
was 1
no 1
nearer 1
than 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
funny 1
though 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
did 1
find 1
those 1
extremely 1
clear 1
ideas 1
of 1
ours 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
a 1
country 1
of 1
women 1
would 1
be 1
like 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
tell 1
ourselves 1
and 1
one 1
another 1
that 1
all 1
this 1
was 1
idle 1
speculation 1
we 1
were 1
idle 1
and 1
we 1
did 1
speculate 1
on 1
the 1
ocean 1
voyage 1
and 1
the 1
river 1
voyage 1
too 1
admitting 1
the 1
improbability 1
we 1
d 1
begin 1
solemnly 1
and 1
then 1
launch 1
out 1
again 1
they 1
would 1
fight 1
among 1
themselves 1
terry 1
insisted 1
women 1
always 1
do 1
we 1
mustn 1
t 1
look 1
to 1
find 1
any 1
sort 1
of 1
order 1
and 1
organization 1
you 1
re 1
dead 1
wrong 1
jeff 1
told 1
him 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
like 1
a 1
nunnery 1
under 1
an 1
abbess 1
a 1
peaceful 1
harmonious 1
sisterhood 1
i 1
snorted 1
derision 1
at 1
this 1
idea 1
nuns 1
indeed 1
your 1
peaceful 1
sisterhoods 1
were 1
all 1
celibate 1
jeff 1
and 1
under 1
vows 1
of 1
obedience 1
these 1
are 1
just 1
women 1
and 1
mothers 1
and 1
where 1
there 1
s 1
motherhood 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
find 1
sisterhood 1
not 1
much 1
no 1
sir 1
they 1
ll 1
scrap 1
agreed 1
terry 1
also 1
we 1
mustn 1
t 1
look 1
for 1
inventions 1
and 1
progress 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
awfully 1
primitive 1
how 1
about 1
that 1
cloth 1
mill 1
jeff 1
suggested 1
oh 1
cloth 1
women 1
have 1
always 1
been 1
spinsters 1
but 1
there 1
they 1
stop 1
you 1
ll 1
see 1
we 1
joked 1
terry 1
about 1
his 1
modest 1
impression 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
warmly 1
received 1
but 1
he 1
held 1
his 1
ground 1
you 1
ll 1
see 1
he 1
insisted 1
i 1
ll 1
get 1
solid 1
with 1
them 1
all 1
and 1
play 1
one 1
bunch 1
against 1
another 1
i 1
ll 1
get 1
myself 1
elected 1
king 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
whew 1
solomon 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
back 1
seat 1
where 1
do 1
we 1
come 1
in 1
on 1
that 1
deal 1
i 1
demanded 1
aren 1
t 1
we 1
viziers 1
or 1
anything 1
couldn 1
t 1
risk 1
it 1
he 1
asserted 1
solemnly 1
you 1
might 1
start 1
a 1
revolution 1
probably 1
would 1
no 1
you 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
beheaded 1
or 1
bowstrung 1
or 1
whatever 1
the 1
popular 1
method 1
of 1
execution 1
is 1
you 1
d 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
yourself 1
remember 1
grinned 1
jeff 1
no 1
husky 1
black 1
slaves 1
and 1
mamelukes 1
and 1
there 1
d 1
be 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
only 1
one 1
of 1
you 1
eh 1
van 1
jeff 1
s 1
ideas 1
and 1
terry 1
s 1
were 1
so 1
far 1
apart 1
that 1
sometimes 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
peace 1
between 1
them 1
jeff 1
idealized 1
women 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
southern 1
style 1
he 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
chivalry 1
and 1
sentiment 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
he 1
lived 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
ideals 1
you 1
might 1
say 1
terry 1
did 1
too 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
call 1
his 1
views 1
about 1
women 1
anything 1
so 1
polite 1
as 1
ideals 1
i 1
always 1
liked 1
terry 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
man 1
very 1
much 1
so 1
generous 1
and 1
brave 1
and 1
clever 1
but 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
any 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
college 1
days 1
was 1
quite 1
pleased 1
to 1
have 1
him 1
with 1
our 1
sisters 1
we 1
weren 1
t 1
very 1
stringent 1
heavens 1
no 1
but 1
terry 1
was 1
the 1
limit 1
later 1
on 1
why 1
of 1
course 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
life 1
is 1
his 1
own 1
we 1
held 1
and 1
asked 1
no 1
questions 1
but 1
barring 1
a 1
possible 1
exception 1
in 1
favor 1
of 1
a 1
not 1
impossible 1
wife 1
or 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
or 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
fair 1
relatives 1
of 1
his 1
friends 1
terry 1
s 1
idea 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
that 1
pretty 1
women 1
were 1
just 1
so 1
much 1
game 1
and 1
homely 1
ones 1
not 1
worth 1
considering 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
unpleasant 1
sometimes 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
notions 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
i 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
patience 1
with 1
jeff 1
too 1
he 1
had 1
such 1
rose 1
colored 1
halos 1
on 1
his 1
womenfolks 1
i 1
held 1
a 1
middle 1
ground 1
highly 1
scientific 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
used 1
to 1
argue 1
learnedly 1
about 1
the 1
physiological 1
limitations 1
of 1
the 1
sex 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
advanced 1
on 1
the 1
woman 1
question 1
any 1
of 1
us 1
then 1
so 1
we 1
joked 1
and 1
disputed 1
and 1
speculated 1
and 1
after 1
an 1
interminable 1
journey 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
our 1
old 1
camping 1
place 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
river 1
just 1
poking 1
along 1
that 1
side 1
till 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
navigable 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
lake 1
when 1
we 1
reached 1
that 1
and 1
slid 1
out 1
on 1
its 1
broad 1
glistening 1
bosom 1
with 1
that 1
high 1
gray 1
promontory 1
running 1
out 1
toward 1
us 1
and 1
the 1
straight 1
white 1
fall 1
clearly 1
visible 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
really 1
exciting 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
talk 1
even 1
then 1
of 1
skirting 1
the 1
rock 1
wall 1
and 1
seeking 1
a 1
possible 1
footway 1
up 1
but 1
the 1
marshy 1
jungle 1
made 1
that 1
method 1
look 1
not 1
only 1
difficult 1
but 1
dangerous 1
terry 1
dismissed 1
the 1
plan 1
sharply 1
nonsense 1
fellows 1
we 1
ve 1
decided 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
take 1
months 1
we 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
the 1
provisions 1
no 1
sir 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
take 1
our 1
chances 1
if 1
we 1
get 1
back 1
safe 1
all 1
right 1
if 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
why 1
we 1
re 1
not 1
the 1
first 1
explorers 1
to 1
get 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
shuffle 1
there 1
are 1
plenty 1
to 1
come 1
after 1
us 1
so 1
we 1
got 1
the 1
big 1
biplane 1
together 1
and 1
loaded 1
it 1
with 1
our 1
scientifically 1
compressed 1
baggage 1
the 1
camera 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
glasses 1
a 1
supply 1
of 1
concentrated 1
food 1
our 1
pockets 1
were 1
magazines 1
of 1
small 1
necessities 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
our 1
guns 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
knowing 1
what 1
might 1
happen 1
up 1
and 1
up 1
and 1
up 1
we 1
sailed 1
way 1
up 1
at 1
first 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
lay 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
make 1
note 1
of 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
dark 1
green 1
sea 1
of 1
crowding 1
forest 1
this 1
high 1
standing 1
spur 1
rose 1
steeply 1
it 1
ran 1
back 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
apparently 1
to 1
the 1
far 1
off 1
white 1
crowned 1
peaks 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
themselves 1
probably 1
inaccessible 1
let 1
s 1
make 1
the 1
first 1
trip 1
geographical 1
i 1
suggested 1
spy 1
out 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
drop 1
back 1
here 1
for 1
more 1
gasoline 1
with 1
your 1
tremendous 1
speed 1
we 1
can 1
reach 1
that 1
range 1
and 1
back 1
all 1
right 1
then 1
we 1
can 1
leave 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
map 1
on 1
board 1
for 1
that 1
relief 1
expedition 1
there 1
s 1
sense 1
in 1
that 1
terry 1
agreed 1
i 1
ll 1
put 1
off 1
being 1
king 1
of 1
ladyland 1
for 1
one 1
more 1
day 1
so 1
we 1
made 1
a 1
long 1
skirting 1
voyage 1
turned 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
the 1
cape 1
which 1
was 1
close 1
by 1
ran 1
up 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
triangle 1
at 1
our 1
best 1
speed 1
crossed 1
over 1
the 1
base 1
where 1
it 1
left 1
the 1
higher 1
mountains 1
and 1
so 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
lake 1
by 1
moonlight 1
that 1
s 1
not 1
a 1
bad 1
little 1
kingdom 1
we 1
agreed 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
roughly 1
drawn 1
and 1
measured 1
we 1
could 1
tell 1
the 1
size 1
fairly 1
by 1
our 1
speed 1
and 1
from 1
what 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
of 1
the 1
sides 1
and 1
that 1
icy 1
ridge 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
end 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
pretty 1
enterprising 1
savage 1
who 1
would 1
manage 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
it 1
jeff 1
said 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
had 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
land 1
itself 1
eagerly 1
but 1
we 1
were 1
too 1
high 1
and 1
going 1
too 1
fast 1
to 1
see 1
much 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
well 1
forested 1
about 1
the 1
edges 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
interior 1
there 1
were 1
wide 1
plains 1
and 1
everywhere 1
parklike 1
meadows 1
and 1
open 1
places 1
there 1
were 1
cities 1
too 1
that 1
i 1
insisted 1
it 1
looked 1
well 1
it 1
looked 1
like 1
any 1
other 1
country 1
a 1
civilized 1
one 1
i 1
mean 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
sleep 1
after 1
that 1
long 1
sweep 1
through 1
the 1
air 1
but 1
we 1
turned 1
out 1
early 1
enough 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
again 1
we 1
rose 1
softly 1
up 1
the 1
height 1
till 1
we 1
could 1
top 1
the 1
crowning 1
trees 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
broad 1
fair 1
land 1
at 1
our 1
pleasure 1
semitropical 1
looks 1
like 1
a 1
first 1
rate 1
climate 1
it 1
s 1
wonderful 1
what 1
a 1
little 1
height 1
will 1
do 1
for 1
temperature 1
terry 1
was 1
studying 1
the 1
forest 1
growth 1
little 1
height 1
is 1
that 1
what 1
you 1
call 1
little 1
i 1
asked 1
our 1
instruments 1
measured 1
it 1
clearly 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
realized 1
the 1
long 1
gentle 1
rise 1
from 1
the 1
coast 1
perhaps 1
mighty 1
lucky 1
piece 1
of 1
land 1
i 1
call 1
it 1
terry 1
pursued 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
folks 1
i 1
ve 1
had 1
enough 1
scenery 1
so 1
we 1
sailed 1
low 1
crossing 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
quartering 1
the 1
country 1
as 1
we 1
went 1
and 1
studying 1
it 1
we 1
saw 1
i 1
can 1
t 1
remember 1
now 1
how 1
much 1
of 1
this 1
we 1
noted 1
then 1
and 1
how 1
much 1
was 1
supplemented 1
by 1
our 1
later 1
knowledge 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
seeing 1
this 1
much 1
even 1
on 1
that 1
excited 1
day 1
a 1
land 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
perfect 1
cultivation 1
where 1
even 1
the 1
forests 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
cared 1
for 1
a 1
land 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
an 1
enormous 1
park 1
only 1
it 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
evidently 1
an 1
enormous 1
garden 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
any 1
cattle 1
i 1
suggested 1
but 1
terry 1
was 1
silent 1
we 1
were 1
approaching 1
a 1
village 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
we 1
paid 1
small 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
clean 1
well 1
built 1
roads 1
to 1
the 1
attractive 1
architecture 1
to 1
the 1
ordered 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
town 1
we 1
had 1
our 1
glasses 1
out 1
even 1
terry 1
setting 1
his 1
machine 1
for 1
a 1
spiral 1
glide 1
clapped 1
the 1
binoculars 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
they 1
heard 1
our 1
whirring 1
screw 1
they 1
ran 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
they 1
gathered 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
fields 1
swift 1
running 1
light 1
figures 1
crowds 1
of 1
them 1
we 1
stared 1
and 1
stared 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
almost 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
levers 1
sweep 1
off 1
and 1
rise 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
held 1
our 1
peace 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
run 1
upward 1
gosh 1
said 1
terry 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
only 1
women 1
there 1
and 1
children 1
jeff 1
urged 1
excitedly 1
but 1
they 1
look 1
why 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
civilized 1
country 1
i 1
protested 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
men 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
are 1
men 1
said 1
terry 1
come 1
on 1
let 1
s 1
find 1
em 1
he 1
refused 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
jeff 1
s 1
suggestion 1
that 1
we 1
examine 1
the 1
country 1
further 1
before 1
we 1
risked 1
leaving 1
our 1
machine 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
fine 1
landing 1
place 1
right 1
there 1
where 1
we 1
came 1
over 1
he 1
insisted 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
one 1
a 1
wide 1
flat 1
topped 1
rock 1
overlooking 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
from 1
the 1
interior 1
they 1
won 1
t 1
find 1
this 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
he 1
asserted 1
as 1
we 1
scrambled 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
difficulty 1
down 1
to 1
safer 1
footing 1
come 1
on 1
boys 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
good 1
lookers 1
in 1
that 1
bunch 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
was 1
unwise 1
of 1
us 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
afterward 1
that 1
our 1
best 1
plan 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
studied 1
the 1
country 1
more 1
fully 1
before 1
we 1
left 1
our 1
swooping 1
airship 1
and 1
trusted 1
ourselves 1
to 1
mere 1
foot 1
service 1
but 1
we 1
were 1
three 1
young 1
men 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
talking 1
about 1
this 1
country 1
for 1
over 1
a 1
year 1
hardly 1
believing 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
and 1
now 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
it 1
it 1
looked 1
safe 1
and 1
civilized 1
enough 1
and 1
among 1
those 1
upturned 1
crowding 1
faces 1
though 1
some 1
were 1
terrified 1
enough 1
there 1
was 1
great 1
beauty 1
on 1
that 1
we 1
all 1
agreed 1
come 1
on 1
cried 1
terry 1
pushing 1
forward 1
oh 1
come 1
on 1
here 1
goes 1
for 1
herland 1
chapter 1
2 1
rash 1
advances 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
ten 1
or 1
fifteen 1
miles 1
we 1
judged 1
it 1
from 1
our 1
landing 1
rock 1
to 1
that 1
last 1
village 1
for 1
all 1
our 1
eagerness 1
we 1
thought 1
it 1
wise 1
to 1
keep 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
go 1
carefully 1
even 1
terry 1
s 1
ardor 1
was 1
held 1
in 1
check 1
by 1
his 1
firm 1
conviction 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
men 1
to 1
be 1
met 1
and 1
we 1
saw 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
stock 1
of 1
cartridges 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
scarce 1
and 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
hidden 1
away 1
somewhere 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
matriarchate 1
as 1
jeff 1
tells 1
us 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
they 1
may 1
live 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
mountains 1
yonder 1
and 1
keep 1
the 1
women 1
in 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
sort 1
of 1
a 1
national 1
harem 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
men 1
somewhere 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
babies 1
we 1
had 1
all 1
seen 1
babies 1
children 1
big 1
and 1
little 1
everywhere 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
come 1
near 1
enough 1
to 1
distinguish 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
though 1
by 1
dress 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
sure 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
grown 1
persons 1
still 1
there 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
one 1
man 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
certain 1
of 1
i 1
always 1
liked 1
that 1
arab 1
saying 1
first 1
tie 1
your 1
camel 1
and 1
then 1
trust 1
in 1
the 1
lord 1
jeff 1
murmured 1
so 1
we 1
all 1
had 1
our 1
weapons 1
in 1
hand 1
and 1
stole 1
cautiously 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
terry 1
studied 1
it 1
as 1
we 1
progressed 1
talk 1
of 1
civilization 1
he 1
cried 1
softly 1
in 1
restrained 1
enthusiasm 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
forest 1
so 1
petted 1
even 1
in 1
germany 1
look 1
there 1
s 1
not 1
a 1
dead 1
bough 1
the 1
vines 1
are 1
trained 1
actually 1
and 1
see 1
here 1
he 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
him 1
calling 1
jeff 1
s 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
kinds 1
of 1
trees 1
they 1
left 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
landmark 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
limited 1
excursion 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
food 1
bearing 1
practically 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
announced 1
returning 1
the 1
rest 1
splendid 1
hardwood 1
call 1
this 1
a 1
forest 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
truck 1
farm 1
good 1
thing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
botanist 1
on 1
hand 1
i 1
agreed 1
sure 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
medicinal 1
ones 1
or 1
any 1
for 1
pure 1
ornament 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fact 1
they 1
were 1
quite 1
right 1
these 1
towering 1
trees 1
were 1
under 1
as 1
careful 1
cultivation 1
as 1
so 1
many 1
cabbages 1
in 1
other 1
conditions 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
found 1
those 1
woods 1
full 1
of 1
fair 1
foresters 1
and 1
fruit 1
gatherers 1
but 1
an 1
airship 1
is 1
a 1
conspicuous 1
object 1
and 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
quiet 1
and 1
women 1
are 1
cautious 1
all 1
we 1
found 1
moving 1
in 1
those 1
woods 1
as 1
we 1
started 1
through 1
them 1
were 1
birds 1
some 1
gorgeous 1
some 1
musical 1
all 1
so 1
tame 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
almost 1
to 1
contradict 1
our 1
theory 1
of 1
cultivation 1
at 1
least 1
until 1
we 1
came 1
upon 1
occasional 1
little 1
glades 1
where 1
carved 1
stone 1
seats 1
and 1
tables 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
beside 1
clear 1
fountains 1
with 1
shallow 1
bird 1
baths 1
always 1
added 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
kill 1
birds 1
and 1
apparently 1
they 1
do 1
kill 1
cats 1
terry 1
declared 1
must 1
be 1
men 1
here 1
hark 1
we 1
had 1
heard 1
something 1
something 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
like 1
a 1
birdsong 1
and 1
very 1
much 1
like 1
a 1
suppressed 1
whisper 1
of 1
laughter 1
a 1
little 1
happy 1
sound 1
instantly 1
smothered 1
we 1
stood 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
pointers 1
and 1
then 1
used 1
our 1
glasses 1
swiftly 1
carefully 1
it 1
couldn 1
t 1
have 1
been 1
far 1
off 1
said 1
terry 1
excitedly 1
how 1
about 1
this 1
big 1
tree 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
and 1
beautiful 1
tree 1
in 1
the 1
glade 1
we 1
had 1
just 1
entered 1
with 1
thick 1
wide 1
spreading 1
branches 1
that 1
sloped 1
out 1
in 1
lapping 1
fans 1
like 1
a 1
beech 1
or 1
pine 1
it 1
was 1
trimmed 1
underneath 1
some 1
twenty 1
feet 1
up 1
and 1
stood 1
there 1
like 1
a 1
huge 1
umbrella 1
with 1
circling 1
seats 1
beneath 1
look 1
he 1
pursued 1
there 1
are 1
short 1
stumps 1
of 1
branches 1
left 1
to 1
climb 1
on 1
there 1
s 1
someone 1
up 1
that 1
tree 1
i 1
believe 1
we 1
stole 1
near 1
cautiously 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
poisoned 1
arrow 1
in 1
your 1
eye 1
i 1
suggested 1
but 1
terry 1
pressed 1
forward 1
sprang 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
seat 1
back 1
and 1
grasped 1
the 1
trunk 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
more 1
likely 1
he 1
answered 1
gee 1
look 1
boys 1
we 1
rushed 1
close 1
in 1
and 1
looked 1
up 1
there 1
among 1
the 1
boughs 1
overhead 1
was 1
something 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
something 1
that 1
clung 1
motionless 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
great 1
trunk 1
at 1
first 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
one 1
and 1
all 1
we 1
started 1
up 1
the 1
tree 1
separated 1
into 1
three 1
swift 1
moving 1
figures 1
and 1
fled 1
upward 1
as 1
we 1
climbed 1
we 1
could 1
catch 1
glimpses 1
of 1
them 1
scattering 1
above 1
us 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
had 1
reached 1
about 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
three 1
men 1
together 1
dared 1
push 1
they 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
main 1
trunk 1
and 1
moved 1
outward 1
each 1
one 1
balanced 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
branch 1
that 1
dipped 1
and 1
swayed 1
beneath 1
the 1
weight 1
we 1
paused 1
uncertain 1
if 1
we 1
pursued 1
further 1
the 1
boughs 1
would 1
break 1
under 1
the 1
double 1
burden 1
we 1
might 1
shake 1
them 1
off 1
perhaps 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
was 1
so 1
inclined 1
in 1
the 1
soft 1
dappled 1
light 1
of 1
these 1
high 1
regions 1
breathless 1
with 1
our 1
rapid 1
climb 1
we 1
rested 1
awhile 1
eagerly 1
studying 1
our 1
objects 1
of 1
pursuit 1
while 1
they 1
in 1
turn 1
with 1
no 1
more 1
terror 1
than 1
a 1
set 1
of 1
frolicsome 1
children 1
in 1
a 1
game 1
of 1
tag 1
sat 1
as 1
lightly 1
as 1
so 1
many 1
big 1
bright 1
birds 1
on 1
their 1
precarious 1
perches 1
and 1
frankly 1
curiously 1
stared 1
at 1
us 1
girls 1
whispered 1
jeff 1
under 1
his 1
breath 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
might 1
fly 1
if 1
he 1
spoke 1
aloud 1
peaches 1
added 1
terry 1
scarcely 1
louder 1
peacherinos 1
apricot 1
nectarines 1
whew 1
they 1
were 1
girls 1
of 1
course 1
no 1
boys 1
could 1
ever 1
have 1
shown 1
that 1
sparkling 1
beauty 1
and 1
yet 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
was 1
certain 1
at 1
first 1
we 1
saw 1
short 1
hair 1
hatless 1
loose 1
and 1
shining 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
some 1
light 1
firm 1
stuff 1
the 1
closest 1
of 1
tunics 1
and 1
kneebreeches 1
met 1
by 1
trim 1
gaiters 1
as 1
bright 1
and 1
smooth 1
as 1
parrots 1
and 1
as 1
unaware 1
of 1
danger 1
they 1
swung 1
there 1
before 1
us 1
wholly 1
at 1
ease 1
staring 1
as 1
we 1
stared 1
till 1
first 1
one 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
burst 1
into 1
peals 1
of 1
delighted 1
laughter 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
torrent 1
of 1
soft 1
talk 1
tossed 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
no 1
savage 1
sing 1
song 1
but 1
clear 1
musical 1
fluent 1
speech 1
we 1
met 1
their 1
laughter 1
cordially 1
and 1
doffed 1
our 1
hats 1
to 1
them 1
at 1
which 1
they 1
laughed 1
again 1
delightedly 1
then 1
terry 1
wholly 1
in 1
his 1
element 1
made 1
a 1
polite 1
speech 1
with 1
explanatory 1
gestures 1
and 1
proceeded 1
to 1
introduce 1
us 1
with 1
pointing 1
finger 1
mr 1
jeff 1
margrave 1
he 1
said 1
clearly 1
jeff 1
bowed 1
as 1
gracefully 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
could 1
in 1
the 1
fork 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
limb 1
mr 1
vandyck 1
jennings 1
i 1
also 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
an 1
effective 1
salute 1
and 1
nearly 1
lost 1
my 1
balance 1
then 1
terry 1
laid 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
chest 1
a 1
fine 1
chest 1
he 1
had 1
too 1
and 1
introduced 1
himself 1
he 1
was 1
braced 1
carefully 1
for 1
the 1
occasion 1
and 1
achieved 1
an 1
excellent 1
obeisance 1
again 1
they 1
laughed 1
delightedly 1
and 1
the 1
one 1
nearest 1
me 1
followed 1
his 1
tactics 1
celis 1
she 1
said 1
distinctly 1
pointing 1
to 1
the 1
one 1
in 1
blue 1
alima 1
the 1
one 1
in 1
rose 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
vivid 1
imitation 1
of 1
terry 1
s 1
impressive 1
manner 1
she 1
laid 1
a 1
firm 1
delicate 1
hand 1
on 1
her 1
gold 1
green 1
jerkin 1
ellador 1
this 1
was 1
pleasant 1
but 1
we 1
got 1
no 1
nearer 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
sit 1
here 1
and 1
learn 1
the 1
language 1
terry 1
protested 1
he 1
beckoned 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
come 1
nearer 1
most 1
winningly 1
but 1
they 1
gaily 1
shook 1
their 1
heads 1
he 1
suggested 1
by 1
signs 1
that 1
we 1
all 1
go 1
down 1
together 1
but 1
again 1
they 1
shook 1
their 1
heads 1
still 1
merrily 1
then 1
ellador 1
clearly 1
indicated 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
go 1
down 1
pointing 1
to 1
each 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
with 1
unmistakable 1
firmness 1
and 1
further 1
seeming 1
to 1
imply 1
by 1
the 1
sweep 1
of 1
a 1
lithe 1
arm 1
that 1
we 1
not 1
only 1
go 1
downward 1
but 1
go 1
away 1
altogether 1
at 1
which 1
we 1
shook 1
our 1
heads 1
in 1
turn 1
have 1
to 1
use 1
bait 1
grinned 1
terry 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
about 1
you 1
fellows 1
but 1
i 1
came 1
prepared 1
he 1
produced 1
from 1
an 1
inner 1
pocket 1
a 1
little 1
box 1
of 1
purple 1
velvet 1
that 1
opened 1
with 1
a 1
snap 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
long 1
sparkling 1
thing 1
a 1
necklace 1
of 1
big 1
varicolored 1
stones 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
worth 1
a 1
million 1
if 1
real 1
ones 1
he 1
held 1
it 1
up 1
swung 1
it 1
glittering 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
offered 1
it 1
first 1
to 1
one 1
then 1
to 1
another 1
holding 1
it 1
out 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
reach 1
toward 1
the 1
girl 1
nearest 1
him 1
he 1
stood 1
braced 1
in 1
the 1
fork 1
held 1
firmly 1
by 1
one 1
hand 1
the 1
other 1
swinging 1
his 1
bright 1
temptation 1
reached 1
far 1
out 1
along 1
the 1
bough 1
but 1
not 1
quite 1
to 1
his 1
full 1
stretch 1
she 1
was 1
visibly 1
moved 1
i 1
noted 1
hesitated 1
spoke 1
to 1
her 1
companions 1
they 1
chattered 1
softly 1
together 1
one 1
evidently 1
warning 1
her 1
the 1
other 1
encouraging 1
then 1
softly 1
and 1
slowly 1
she 1
drew 1
nearer 1
this 1
was 1
alima 1
a 1
tall 1
long 1
limbed 1
lass 1
well 1
knit 1
and 1
evidently 1
both 1
strong 1
and 1
agile 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
splendid 1
wide 1
fearless 1
as 1
free 1
from 1
suspicion 1
as 1
a 1
child 1
s 1
who 1
has 1
never 1
been 1
rebuked 1
her 1
interest 1
was 1
more 1
that 1
of 1
an 1
intent 1
boy 1
playing 1
a 1
fascinating 1
game 1
than 1
of 1
a 1
girl 1
lured 1
by 1
an 1
ornament 1
the 1
others 1
moved 1
a 1
bit 1
farther 1
out 1
holding 1
firmly 1
watching 1
terry 1
s 1
smile 1
was 1
irreproachable 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
the 1
look 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
creature 1
about 1
to 1
spring 1
i 1
could 1
already 1
see 1
it 1
happen 1
the 1
dropped 1
necklace 1
the 1
sudden 1
clutching 1
hand 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
sharp 1
cry 1
as 1
he 1
seized 1
her 1
and 1
drew 1
her 1
in 1
but 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
happen 1
she 1
made 1
a 1
timid 1
reach 1
with 1
her 1
right 1
hand 1
for 1
the 1
gay 1
swinging 1
thing 1
he 1
held 1
it 1
a 1
little 1
nearer 1
then 1
swift 1
as 1
light 1
she 1
seized 1
it 1
from 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
left 1
and 1
dropped 1
on 1
the 1
instant 1
to 1
the 1
bough 1
below 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
snatch 1
quite 1
vainly 1
almost 1
losing 1
his 1
position 1
as 1
his 1
hand 1
clutched 1
only 1
air 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
inconceivable 1
rapidity 1
the 1
three 1
bright 1
creatures 1
were 1
gone 1
they 1
dropped 1
from 1
the 1
ends 1
of 1
the 1
big 1
boughs 1
to 1
those 1
below 1
fairly 1
pouring 1
themselves 1
off 1
the 1
tree 1
while 1
we 1
climbed 1
downward 1
as 1
swiftly 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
we 1
heard 1
their 1
vanishing 1
gay 1
laughter 1
we 1
saw 1
them 1
fleeting 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
wide 1
open 1
reaches 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
gave 1
chase 1
but 1
we 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
have 1
chased 1
wild 1
antelopes 1
so 1
we 1
stopped 1
at 1
length 1
somewhat 1
breathless 1
no 1
use 1
gasped 1
terry 1
they 1
got 1
away 1
with 1
it 1
my 1
word 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
this 1
country 1
must 1
be 1
good 1
sprinters 1
inhabitants 1
evidently 1
arboreal 1
i 1
grimly 1
suggested 1
civilized 1
and 1
still 1
arboreal 1
peculiar 1
people 1
you 1
shouldn 1
t 1
have 1
tried 1
that 1
way 1
jeff 1
protested 1
they 1
were 1
perfectly 1
friendly 1
now 1
we 1
ve 1
scared 1
them 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
use 1
grumbling 1
and 1
terry 1
refused 1
to 1
admit 1
any 1
mistake 1
nonsense 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
expected 1
it 1
women 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
run 1
after 1
come 1
on 1
let 1
s 1
get 1
to 1
that 1
town 1
maybe 1
we 1
ll 1
find 1
them 1
there 1
let 1
s 1
see 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
this 1
direction 1
and 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
as 1
i 1
remember 1
when 1
we 1
reached 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
we 1
reconnoitered 1
with 1
our 1
field 1
glasses 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
four 1
miles 1
off 1
the 1
same 1
town 1
we 1
concluded 1
unless 1
as 1
jeff 1
ventured 1
they 1
all 1
had 1
pink 1
houses 1
the 1
broad 1
green 1
fields 1
and 1
closely 1
cultivated 1
gardens 1
sloped 1
away 1
at 1
our 1
feet 1
a 1
long 1
easy 1
slant 1
with 1
good 1
roads 1
winding 1
pleasantly 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
and 1
narrower 1
paths 1
besides 1
look 1
at 1
that 1
cried 1
jeff 1
suddenly 1
there 1
they 1
go 1
sure 1
enough 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
across 1
a 1
wide 1
meadow 1
three 1
bright 1
hued 1
figures 1
were 1
running 1
swiftly 1
how 1
could 1
they 1
have 1
got 1
that 1
far 1
in 1
this 1
time 1
it 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
the 1
same 1
ones 1
i 1
urged 1
but 1
through 1
the 1
glasses 1
we 1
could 1
identify 1
our 1
pretty 1
tree 1
climbers 1
quite 1
plainly 1
at 1
least 1
by 1
costume 1
terry 1
watched 1
them 1
we 1
all 1
did 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
till 1
they 1
disappeared 1
among 1
the 1
houses 1
then 1
he 1
put 1
down 1
his 1
glass 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
us 1
drawing 1
a 1
long 1
breath 1
mother 1
of 1
mike 1
boys 1
what 1
gorgeous 1
girls 1
to 1
climb 1
like 1
that 1
to 1
run 1
like 1
that 1
and 1
afraid 1
of 1
nothing 1
this 1
country 1
suits 1
me 1
all 1
right 1
let 1
s 1
get 1
ahead 1
nothing 1
venture 1
nothing 1
have 1
i 1
suggested 1
but 1
terry 1
preferred 1
faint 1
heart 1
ne 1
er 1
won 1
fair 1
lady 1
we 1
set 1
forth 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
walking 1
briskly 1
if 1
there 1
are 1
any 1
men 1
we 1
d 1
better 1
keep 1
an 1
eye 1
out 1
i 1
suggested 1
but 1
jeff 1
seemed 1
lost 1
in 1
heavenly 1
dreams 1
and 1
terry 1
in 1
highly 1
practical 1
plans 1
what 1
a 1
perfect 1
road 1
what 1
a 1
heavenly 1
country 1
see 1
the 1
flowers 1
will 1
you 1
this 1
was 1
jeff 1
always 1
an 1
enthusiast 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
agree 1
with 1
him 1
fully 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
hard 1
manufactured 1
stuff 1
sloped 1
slightly 1
to 1
shed 1
rain 1
with 1
every 1
curve 1
and 1
grade 1
and 1
gutter 1
as 1
perfect 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
europe 1
s 1
best 1
no 1
men 1
eh 1
sneered 1
terry 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
a 1
double 1
row 1
of 1
trees 1
shaded 1
the 1
footpaths 1
between 1
the 1
trees 1
bushes 1
or 1
vines 1
all 1
fruit 1
bearing 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
seats 1
and 1
little 1
wayside 1
fountains 1
everywhere 1
flowers 1
we 1
d 1
better 1
import 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
ladies 1
and 1
set 1
em 1
to 1
parking 1
the 1
united 1
states 1
i 1
suggested 1
mighty 1
nice 1
place 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
here 1
we 1
rested 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
fountains 1
tested 1
the 1
fruit 1
that 1
looked 1
ripe 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
impressed 1
for 1
all 1
our 1
gay 1
bravado 1
by 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
quiet 1
potency 1
which 1
lay 1
about 1
us 1
here 1
was 1
evidently 1
a 1
people 1
highly 1
skilled 1
efficient 1
caring 1
for 1
their 1
country 1
as 1
a 1
florist 1
cares 1
for 1
his 1
costliest 1
orchids 1
under 1
the 1
soft 1
brilliant 1
blue 1
of 1
that 1
clear 1
sky 1
in 1
the 1
pleasant 1
shade 1
of 1
those 1
endless 1
rows 1
of 1
trees 1
we 1
walked 1
unharmed 1
the 1
placid 1
silence 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
birds 1
presently 1
there 1
lay 1
before 1
us 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
hill 1
the 1
town 1
or 1
village 1
we 1
were 1
aiming 1
for 1
we 1
stopped 1
and 1
studied 1
it 1
jeff 1
drew 1
a 1
long 1
breath 1
i 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
believed 1
a 1
collection 1
of 1
houses 1
could 1
look 1
so 1
lovely 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
architects 1
and 1
landscape 1
gardeners 1
in 1
plenty 1
that 1
s 1
sure 1
agreed 1
terry 1
i 1
was 1
astonished 1
myself 1
you 1
see 1
i 1
come 1
from 1
california 1
and 1
there 1
s 1
no 1
country 1
lovelier 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
towns 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
groaned 1
at 1
home 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
offensive 1
mess 1
man 1
made 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
nature 1
even 1
though 1
i 1
m 1
no 1
art 1
sharp 1
like 1
jeff 1
but 1
this 1
place 1
it 1
was 1
built 1
mostly 1
of 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
dull 1
rose 1
colored 1
stone 1
with 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
some 1
clear 1
white 1
houses 1
and 1
it 1
lay 1
abroad 1
among 1
the 1
green 1
groves 1
and 1
gardens 1
like 1
a 1
broken 1
rosary 1
of 1
pink 1
coral 1
those 1
big 1
white 1
ones 1
are 1
public 1
buildings 1
evidently 1
terry 1
declared 1
this 1
is 1
no 1
savage 1
country 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
no 1
men 1
boys 1
it 1
behooves 1
us 1
to 1
go 1
forward 1
most 1
politely 1
the 1
place 1
had 1
an 1
odd 1
look 1
more 1
impressive 1
as 1
we 1
approached 1
it 1
s 1
like 1
an 1
exposition 1
it 1
s 1
too 1
pretty 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
plenty 1
of 1
palaces 1
but 1
where 1
are 1
the 1
homes 1
oh 1
there 1
are 1
little 1
ones 1
enough 1
but 1
it 1
certainly 1
was 1
different 1
from 1
any 1
towns 1
we 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
there 1
s 1
no 1
dirt 1
said 1
jeff 1
suddenly 1
there 1
s 1
no 1
smoke 1
he 1
added 1
after 1
a 1
little 1
there 1
s 1
no 1
noise 1
i 1
offered 1
but 1
terry 1
snubbed 1
me 1
that 1
s 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
laying 1
low 1
for 1
us 1
we 1
d 1
better 1
be 1
careful 1
how 1
we 1
go 1
in 1
there 1
nothing 1
could 1
induce 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
out 1
however 1
so 1
we 1
walked 1
on 1
everything 1
was 1
beauty 1
order 1
perfect 1
cleanness 1
and 1
the 1
pleasantest 1
sense 1
of 1
home 1
over 1
it 1
all 1
as 1
we 1
neared 1
the 1
center 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
the 1
houses 1
stood 1
thicker 1
ran 1
together 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
grew 1
into 1
rambling 1
palaces 1
grouped 1
among 1
parks 1
and 1
open 1
squares 1
something 1
as 1
college 1
buildings 1
stand 1
in 1
their 1
quiet 1
greens 1
and 1
then 1
turning 1
a 1
corner 1
we 1
came 1
into 1
a 1
broad 1
paved 1
space 1
and 1
saw 1
before 1
us 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
women 1
standing 1
close 1
together 1
in 1
even 1
order 1
evidently 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
we 1
stopped 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
the 1
street 1
behind 1
was 1
closed 1
by 1
another 1
band 1
marching 1
steadily 1
shoulder 1
to 1
shoulder 1
we 1
went 1
on 1
there 1
seemed 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
presently 1
found 1
ourselves 1
quite 1
surrounded 1
by 1
this 1
close 1
massed 1
multitude 1
women 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
young 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
old 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
girl 1
sense 1
beautiful 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
ferocious 1
and 1
yet 1
as 1
i 1
looked 1
from 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
calm 1
grave 1
wise 1
wholly 1
unafraid 1
evidently 1
assured 1
and 1
determined 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
funniest 1
feeling 1
a 1
very 1
early 1
feeling 1
a 1
feeling 1
that 1
i 1
traced 1
back 1
and 1
back 1
in 1
memory 1
until 1
i 1
caught 1
up 1
with 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
sense 1
of 1
being 1
hopelessly 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
often 1
felt 1
in 1
early 1
youth 1
when 1
my 1
short 1
legs 1
utmost 1
effort 1
failed 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
late 1
to 1
school 1
jeff 1
felt 1
it 1
too 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
he 1
did 1
we 1
felt 1
like 1
small 1
boys 1
very 1
small 1
boys 1
caught 1
doing 1
mischief 1
in 1
some 1
gracious 1
lady 1
s 1
house 1
but 1
terry 1
showed 1
no 1
such 1
consciousness 1
i 1
saw 1
his 1
quick 1
eyes 1
darting 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
estimating 1
numbers 1
measuring 1
distances 1
judging 1
chances 1
of 1
escape 1
he 1
examined 1
the 1
close 1
ranks 1
about 1
us 1
reaching 1
back 1
far 1
on 1
every 1
side 1
and 1
murmured 1
softly 1
to 1
me 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
em 1
over 1
forty 1
as 1
i 1
m 1
a 1
sinner 1
yet 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
old 1
women 1
each 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
full 1
bloom 1
of 1
rosy 1
health 1
erect 1
serene 1
standing 1
sure 1
footed 1
and 1
light 1
as 1
any 1
pugilist 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
weapons 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
wish 1
to 1
shoot 1
i 1
d 1
as 1
soon 1
shoot 1
my 1
aunts 1
muttered 1
terry 1
again 1
what 1
do 1
they 1
want 1
with 1
us 1
anyhow 1
they 1
seem 1
to 1
mean 1
business 1
but 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
that 1
businesslike 1
aspect 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
try 1
his 1
favorite 1
tactics 1
terry 1
had 1
come 1
armed 1
with 1
a 1
theory 1
he 1
stepped 1
forward 1
with 1
his 1
brilliant 1
ingratiating 1
smile 1
and 1
made 1
low 1
obeisance 1
to 1
the 1
women 1
before 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
produced 1
another 1
tribute 1
a 1
broad 1
soft 1
scarf 1
of 1
filmy 1
texture 1
rich 1
in 1
color 1
and 1
pattern 1
a 1
lovely 1
thing 1
even 1
to 1
my 1
eye 1
and 1
offered 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
deep 1
bow 1
to 1
the 1
tall 1
unsmiling 1
woman 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
head 1
the 1
ranks 1
before 1
him 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
gracious 1
nod 1
of 1
acknowledgment 1
and 1
passed 1
it 1
on 1
to 1
those 1
behind 1
her 1
he 1
tried 1
again 1
this 1
time 1
bringing 1
out 1
a 1
circlet 1
of 1
rhinestones 1
a 1
glittering 1
crown 1
that 1
should 1
have 1
pleased 1
any 1
woman 1
on 1
earth 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
brief 1
address 1
including 1
jeff 1
and 1
me 1
as 1
partners 1
in 1
his 1
enterprise 1
and 1
with 1
another 1
bow 1
presented 1
this 1
again 1
his 1
gift 1
was 1
accepted 1
and 1
as 1
before 1
passed 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
only 1
younger 1
he 1
muttered 1
between 1
his 1
teeth 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
is 1
a 1
fellow 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
a 1
regiment 1
of 1
old 1
colonels 1
like 1
this 1
in 1
all 1
our 1
discussions 1
and 1
speculations 1
we 1
had 1
always 1
unconsciously 1
assumed 1
that 1
the 1
women 1
whatever 1
else 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
would 1
be 1
young 1
most 1
men 1
do 1
think 1
that 1
way 1
i 1
fancy 1
woman 1
in 1
the 1
abstract 1
is 1
young 1
and 1
we 1
assume 1
charming 1
as 1
they 1
get 1
older 1
they 1
pass 1
off 1
the 1
stage 1
somehow 1
into 1
private 1
ownership 1
mostly 1
or 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
altogether 1
but 1
these 1
good 1
ladies 1
were 1
very 1
much 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
and 1
yet 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
grandmother 1
we 1
looked 1
for 1
nervousness 1
there 1
was 1
none 1
for 1
terror 1
perhaps 1
there 1
was 1
none 1
for 1
uneasiness 1
for 1
curiosity 1
for 1
excitement 1
and 1
all 1
we 1
saw 1
was 1
what 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
vigilance 1
committee 1
of 1
women 1
doctors 1
as 1
cool 1
as 1
cucumbers 1
and 1
evidently 1
meaning 1
to 1
take 1
us 1
to 1
task 1
for 1
being 1
there 1
six 1
of 1
them 1
stepped 1
forward 1
now 1
one 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
indicated 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
them 1
we 1
thought 1
it 1
best 1
to 1
accede 1
at 1
first 1
anyway 1
and 1
marched 1
along 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
close 1
at 1
each 1
elbow 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
in 1
close 1
masses 1
before 1
behind 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
a 1
large 1
building 1
opened 1
before 1
us 1
a 1
very 1
heavy 1
thick 1
walled 1
impressive 1
place 1
big 1
and 1
old 1
looking 1
of 1
gray 1
stone 1
not 1
like 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
this 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
said 1
terry 1
to 1
us 1
quickly 1
we 1
mustn 1
t 1
let 1
them 1
get 1
us 1
in 1
this 1
boys 1
all 1
together 1
now 1
we 1
stopped 1
in 1
our 1
tracks 1
we 1
began 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
make 1
signs 1
pointing 1
away 1
toward 1
the 1
big 1
forest 1
indicating 1
that 1
we 1
would 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
it 1
at 1
once 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
laugh 1
knowing 1
all 1
i 1
do 1
now 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
us 1
three 1
boys 1
nothing 1
else 1
three 1
audacious 1
impertinent 1
boys 1
butting 1
into 1
an 1
unknown 1
country 1
without 1
any 1
sort 1
of 1
a 1
guard 1
or 1
defense 1
we 1
seemed 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
men 1
we 1
could 1
fight 1
them 1
and 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
only 1
women 1
why 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
obstacles 1
at 1
all 1
jeff 1
with 1
his 1
gentle 1
romantic 1
old 1
fashioned 1
notions 1
of 1
women 1
as 1
clinging 1
vines 1
terry 1
with 1
his 1
clear 1
decided 1
practical 1
theories 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
kinds 1
of 1
women 1
those 1
he 1
wanted 1
and 1
those 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
desirable 1
and 1
undesirable 1
was 1
his 1
demarcation 1
the 1
latter 1
as 1
a 1
large 1
class 1
but 1
negligible 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
thought 1
about 1
them 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
now 1
here 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
great 1
numbers 1
evidently 1
indifferent 1
to 1
what 1
he 1
might 1
think 1
evidently 1
determined 1
on 1
some 1
purpose 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
regarding 1
him 1
and 1
apparently 1
well 1
able 1
to 1
enforce 1
their 1
purpose 1
we 1
all 1
thought 1
hard 1
just 1
then 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
seemed 1
wise 1
to 1
object 1
to 1
going 1
with 1
them 1
even 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
have 1
our 1
one 1
chance 1
was 1
friendliness 1
a 1
civilized 1
attitude 1
on 1
both 1
sides 1
but 1
once 1
inside 1
that 1
building 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
knowing 1
what 1
these 1
determined 1
ladies 1
might 1
do 1
to 1
us 1
even 1
a 1
peaceful 1
detention 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
our 1
minds 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
named 1
it 1
imprisonment 1
it 1
looked 1
even 1
worse 1
so 1
we 1
made 1
a 1
stand 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
clear 1
that 1
we 1
preferred 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
came 1
forward 1
with 1
a 1
sketch 1
of 1
our 1
flier 1
asking 1
by 1
signs 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
the 1
aerial 1
visitors 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
this 1
we 1
admitted 1
they 1
pointed 1
to 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
outlying 1
country 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
but 1
we 1
pretended 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
in 1
truth 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
quite 1
sure 1
and 1
gave 1
a 1
rather 1
wild 1
indication 1
of 1
its 1
whereabouts 1
again 1
they 1
motioned 1
us 1
to 1
advance 1
standing 1
so 1
packed 1
about 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
there 1
remained 1
but 1
the 1
one 1
straight 1
path 1
open 1
all 1
around 1
us 1
and 1
behind 1
they 1
were 1
massed 1
solidly 1
there 1
was 1
simply 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
go 1
forward 1
or 1
fight 1
we 1
held 1
a 1
consultation 1
i 1
never 1
fought 1
with 1
women 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
said 1
terry 1
greatly 1
perturbed 1
but 1
i 1
m 1
not 1
going 1
in 1
there 1
i 1
m 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
herded 1
in 1
as 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
cattle 1
chute 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
fight 1
them 1
of 1
course 1
jeff 1
urged 1
they 1
re 1
all 1
women 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
their 1
nondescript 1
clothes 1
nice 1
women 1
too 1
good 1
strong 1
sensible 1
faces 1
i 1
guess 1
we 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
we 1
may 1
never 1
get 1
out 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
i 1
told 1
them 1
strong 1
and 1
sensible 1
yes 1
but 1
i 1
m 1
not 1
so 1
sure 1
about 1
the 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
those 1
faces 1
they 1
had 1
stood 1
at 1
ease 1
waiting 1
while 1
we 1
conferred 1
together 1
but 1
never 1
relaxing 1
their 1
close 1
attention 1
their 1
attitude 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
rigid 1
discipline 1
of 1
soldiers 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sense 1
of 1
compulsion 1
about 1
them 1
terry 1
s 1
term 1
of 1
a 1
vigilance 1
committee 1
was 1
highly 1
descriptive 1
they 1
had 1
just 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
sturdy 1
burghers 1
gathered 1
hastily 1
to 1
meet 1
some 1
common 1
need 1
or 1
peril 1
all 1
moved 1
by 1
precisely 1
the 1
same 1
feelings 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
end 1
never 1
anywhere 1
before 1
had 1
i 1
seen 1
women 1
of 1
precisely 1
this 1
quality 1
fishwives 1
and 1
market 1
women 1
might 1
show 1
similar 1
strength 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
coarse 1
and 1
heavy 1
these 1
were 1
merely 1
athletic 1
light 1
and 1
powerful 1
college 1
professors 1
teachers 1
writers 1
many 1
women 1
showed 1
similar 1
intelligence 1
but 1
often 1
wore 1
a 1
strained 1
nervous 1
look 1
while 1
these 1
were 1
as 1
calm 1
as 1
cows 1
for 1
all 1
their 1
evident 1
intellect 1
we 1
observed 1
pretty 1
closely 1
just 1
then 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
crucial 1
moment 1
the 1
leader 1
gave 1
some 1
word 1
of 1
command 1
and 1
beckoned 1
us 1
on 1
and 1
the 1
surrounding 1
mass 1
moved 1
a 1
step 1
nearer 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
decide 1
quick 1
said 1
terry 1
i 1
vote 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
jeff 1
urged 1
but 1
we 1
were 1
two 1
to 1
one 1
against 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
loyally 1
stood 1
by 1
us 1
we 1
made 1
one 1
more 1
effort 1
to 1
be 1
let 1
go 1
urgent 1
but 1
not 1
imploring 1
in 1
vain 1
now 1
for 1
a 1
rush 1
boys 1
terry 1
said 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
break 1
em 1
i 1
ll 1
shoot 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
then 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
much 1
in 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
the 1
suffragette 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
parliament 1
buildings 1
through 1
a 1
triple 1
cordon 1
of 1
london 1
police 1
the 1
solidity 1
of 1
those 1
women 1
was 1
something 1
amazing 1
terry 1
soon 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
useless 1
tore 1
himself 1
loose 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
pulled 1
his 1
revolver 1
and 1
fired 1
upward 1
as 1
they 1
caught 1
at 1
it 1
he 1
fired 1
again 1
we 1
heard 1
a 1
cry 1
instantly 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
was 1
seized 1
by 1
five 1
women 1
each 1
holding 1
arm 1
or 1
leg 1
or 1
head 1
we 1
were 1
lifted 1
like 1
children 1
straddling 1
helpless 1
children 1
and 1
borne 1
onward 1
wriggling 1
indeed 1
but 1
most 1
ineffectually 1
we 1
were 1
borne 1
inside 1
struggling 1
manfully 1
but 1
held 1
secure 1
most 1
womanfully 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
our 1
best 1
endeavors 1
so 1
carried 1
and 1
so 1
held 1
we 1
came 1
into 1
a 1
high 1
inner 1
hall 1
gray 1
and 1
bare 1
and 1
were 1
brought 1
before 1
a 1
majestic 1
gray 1
haired 1
woman 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
hold 1
a 1
judicial 1
position 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
talk 1
not 1
much 1
among 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
there 1
fell 1
upon 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
at 1
once 1
a 1
firm 1
hand 1
holding 1
a 1
wetted 1
cloth 1
before 1
mouth 1
and 1
nose 1
an 1
order 1
of 1
swimming 1
sweetness 1

chapter 1
3 1
a 1
peculiar 1
imprisonment 1
from 1
a 1
slumber 1
as 1
deep 1
as 1
death 1
as 1
refreshing 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
healthy 1
child 1
i 1
slowly 1
awakened 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
rising 1
up 1
up 1
up 1
through 1
a 1
deep 1
warm 1
ocean 1
nearer 1
and 1
nearer 1
to 1
full 1
light 1
and 1
stirring 1
air 1
or 1
like 1
the 1
return 1
to 1
consciousness 1
after 1
concussion 1
of 1
the 1
brain 1
i 1
was 1
once 1
thrown 1
from 1
a 1
horse 1
while 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
a 1
wild 1
mountainous 1
country 1
quite 1
new 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
clearly 1
remember 1
the 1
mental 1
experience 1
of 1
coming 1
back 1
to 1
life 1
through 1
lifting 1
veils 1
of 1
dream 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
dimly 1
heard 1
the 1
voices 1
of 1
those 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
shining 1
snowpeaks 1
of 1
that 1
mighty 1
range 1
i 1
assumed 1
that 1
this 1
too 1
would 1
pass 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
presently 1
find 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
home 1
that 1
was 1
precisely 1
the 1
experience 1
of 1
this 1
awakening 1
receding 1
waves 1
of 1
half 1
caught 1
swirling 1
vision 1
memories 1
of 1
home 1
the 1
steamer 1
the 1
boat 1
the 1
airship 1
the 1
forest 1
at 1
last 1
all 1
sinking 1
away 1
one 1
after 1
another 1
till 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
wide 1
open 1
my 1
brain 1
clear 1
and 1
i 1
realized 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
the 1
most 1
prominent 1
sensation 1
was 1
of 1
absolute 1
physical 1
comfort 1
i 1
was 1
lying 1
in 1
a 1
perfect 1
bed 1
long 1
broad 1
smooth 1
firmly 1
soft 1
and 1
level 1
with 1
the 1
finest 1
linen 1
some 1
warm 1
light 1
quilt 1
of 1
blanket 1
and 1
a 1
counterpane 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
joy 1
to 1
the 1
eye 1
the 1
sheet 1
turned 1
down 1
some 1
fifteen 1
inches 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
stretch 1
my 1
feet 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
free 1
but 1
warmly 1
covered 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
light 1
and 1
clean 1
as 1
a 1
white 1
feather 1
it 1
took 1
me 1
some 1
time 1
to 1
conscientiously 1
locate 1
my 1
arms 1
and 1
legs 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
vivid 1
sense 1
of 1
life 1
radiate 1
from 1
the 1
wakening 1
center 1
to 1
the 1
extremities 1
a 1
big 1
room 1
high 1
and 1
wide 1
with 1
many 1
lofty 1
windows 1
whose 1
closed 1
blinds 1
let 1
through 1
soft 1
green 1
lit 1
air 1
a 1
beautiful 1
room 1
in 1
proportion 1
in 1
color 1
in 1
smooth 1
simplicity 1
a 1
scent 1
of 1
blossoming 1
gardens 1
outside 1
i 1
lay 1
perfectly 1
still 1
quite 1
happy 1
quite 1
conscious 1
and 1
yet 1
not 1
actively 1
realizing 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
till 1
i 1
heard 1
terry 1
gosh 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
turned 1
my 1
head 1
there 1
were 1
three 1
beds 1
in 1
this 1
chamber 1
and 1
plenty 1
of 1
room 1
for 1
them 1
terry 1
was 1
sitting 1
up 1
looking 1
about 1
him 1
alert 1
as 1
ever 1
his 1
remark 1
though 1
not 1
loud 1
roused 1
jeff 1
also 1
we 1
all 1
sat 1
up 1
terry 1
swung 1
his 1
legs 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
stood 1
up 1
stretched 1
himself 1
mightily 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
nightrobe 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
seamless 1
garment 1
undoubtedly 1
comfortable 1
we 1
all 1
found 1
ourselves 1
so 1
covered 1
shoes 1
were 1
beside 1
each 1
bed 1
also 1
quite 1
comfortable 1
and 1
goodlooking 1
though 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
like 1
our 1
own 1
we 1
looked 1
for 1
our 1
clothes 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
there 1
nor 1
anything 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
varied 1
contents 1
of 1
our 1
pockets 1
a 1
door 1
stood 1
somewhat 1
ajar 1
it 1
opened 1
into 1
a 1
most 1
attractive 1
bathroom 1
copiously 1
provided 1
with 1
towels 1
soap 1
mirrors 1
and 1
all 1
such 1
convenient 1
comforts 1
with 1
indeed 1
our 1
toothbrushes 1
and 1
combs 1
our 1
notebooks 1
and 1
thank 1
goodness 1
our 1
watches 1
but 1
no 1
clothes 1
then 1
we 1
made 1
a 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
big 1
room 1
again 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
large 1
airy 1
closet 1
holding 1
plenty 1
of 1
clothing 1
but 1
not 1
ours 1
a 1
council 1
of 1
war 1
demanded 1
terry 1
come 1
on 1
back 1
to 1
bed 1
the 1
bed 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
anyhow 1
now 1
then 1
my 1
scientific 1
friend 1
let 1
us 1
consider 1
our 1
case 1
dispassionately 1
he 1
meant 1
me 1
but 1
jeff 1
seemed 1
most 1
impressed 1
they 1
haven 1
t 1
hurt 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
killed 1
us 1
or 1
or 1
anything 1
and 1
i 1
never 1
felt 1
better 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
that 1
argues 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
women 1
i 1
suggested 1
and 1
highly 1
civilized 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
hit 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
scrimmage 1
i 1
heard 1
her 1
sing 1
out 1
and 1
we 1
kicked 1
awfully 1
terry 1
was 1
grinning 1
at 1
us 1
so 1
you 1
realize 1
what 1
these 1
ladies 1
have 1
done 1
to 1
us 1
he 1
pleasantly 1
inquired 1
they 1
have 1
taken 1
away 1
all 1
our 1
possessions 1
all 1
our 1
clothes 1
every 1
stitch 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
stripped 1
and 1
washed 1
and 1
put 1
to 1
bed 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
yearling 1
babies 1
by 1
these 1
highly 1
civilized 1
women 1
jeff 1
actually 1
blushed 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
poetic 1
imagination 1
terry 1
had 1
imagination 1
enough 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
kind 1
so 1
had 1
i 1
also 1
different 1
i 1
always 1
flattered 1
myself 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
scientific 1
imagination 1
which 1
incidentally 1
i 1
considered 1
the 1
highest 1
sort 1
one 1
has 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
a 1
certain 1
amount 1
of 1
egotism 1
if 1
founded 1
on 1
fact 1
and 1
kept 1
to 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
i 1
think 1
no 1
use 1
kicking 1
boys 1
i 1
said 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
us 1
and 1
apparently 1
they 1
re 1
perfectly 1
harmless 1
it 1
remains 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
cook 1
up 1
some 1
plan 1
of 1
escape 1
like 1
any 1
other 1
bottled 1
heroes 1
meanwhile 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
these 1
clothes 1
hobson 1
s 1
choice 1
the 1
garments 1
were 1
simple 1
in 1
the 1
extreme 1
and 1
absolutely 1
comfortable 1
physically 1
though 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
all 1
felt 1
like 1
supes 1
in 1
the 1
theater 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
one 1
piece 1
cotton 1
undergarment 1
thin 1
and 1
soft 1
that 1
reached 1
over 1
the 1
knees 1
and 1
shoulders 1
something 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
piece 1
pajamas 1
some 1
fellows 1
wear 1
and 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
half 1
hose 1
that 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
just 1
under 1
the 1
knee 1
and 1
stayed 1
there 1
had 1
elastic 1
tops 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
and 1
covered 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
thicker 1
variety 1
of 1
union 1
suit 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
closet 1
of 1
varying 1
weights 1
and 1
somewhat 1
sturdier 1
material 1
evidently 1
they 1
would 1
do 1
at 1
a 1
pinch 1
with 1
nothing 1
further 1
then 1
there 1
were 1
tunics 1
knee 1
length 1
and 1
some 1
long 1
robes 1
needless 1
to 1
say 1
we 1
took 1
tunics 1
we 1
bathed 1
and 1
dressed 1
quite 1
cheerfully 1
not 1
half 1
bad 1
said 1
terry 1
surveying 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
mirror 1
his 1
hair 1
was 1
somewhat 1
longer 1
than 1
when 1
we 1
left 1
the 1
last 1
barber 1
and 1
the 1
hats 1
provided 1
were 1
much 1
like 1
those 1
seen 1
on 1
the 1
prince 1
in 1
the 1
fairy 1
tale 1
lacking 1
the 1
plume 1
the 1
costume 1
was 1
similar 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
on 1
all 1
the 1
women 1
though 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
those 1
working 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
glimpsed 1
by 1
our 1
glasses 1
when 1
we 1
first 1
flew 1
over 1
wore 1
only 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
i 1
settled 1
my 1
shoulders 1
and 1
stretched 1
my 1
arms 1
remarking 1
they 1
have 1
worked 1
out 1
a 1
mighty 1
sensible 1
dress 1
i 1
ll 1
say 1
that 1
for 1
them 1
with 1
which 1
we 1
all 1
agreed 1
now 1
then 1
terry 1
proclaimed 1
we 1
ve 1
had 1
a 1
fine 1
long 1
sleep 1
we 1
ve 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
bath 1
we 1
re 1
clothed 1
and 1
in 1
our 1
right 1
minds 1
though 1
feeling 1
like 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
neuters 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
these 1
highly 1
civilized 1
ladies 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
any 1
breakfast 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
will 1
jeff 1
asserted 1
confidently 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
meant 1
to 1
kill 1
us 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
it 1
before 1
i 1
believe 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
treated 1
as 1
guests 1
hailed 1
as 1
deliverers 1
i 1
think 1
said 1
terry 1
studied 1
as 1
curiosities 1
i 1
told 1
them 1
but 1
anyhow 1
we 1
want 1
food 1
so 1
now 1
for 1
a 1
sortie 1
a 1
sortie 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
easy 1
the 1
bathroom 1
only 1
opened 1
into 1
our 1
chamber 1
and 1
that 1
had 1
but 1
one 1
outlet 1
a 1
big 1
heavy 1
door 1
which 1
was 1
fastened 1
we 1
listened 1
there 1
s 1
someone 1
outside 1
jeff 1
suggested 1
let 1
s 1
knock 1
so 1
we 1
knocked 1
whereupon 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
outside 1
was 1
another 1
large 1
room 1
furnished 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
table 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
long 1
benches 1
or 1
couches 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
some 1
smaller 1
tables 1
and 1
chairs 1
all 1
these 1
were 1
solid 1
strong 1
simple 1
in 1
structure 1
and 1
comfortable 1
in 1
use 1
also 1
incidentally 1
beautiful 1
this 1
room 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
women 1
eighteen 1
to 1
be 1
exact 1
some 1
of 1
whom 1
we 1
distinctly 1
recalled 1
terry 1
heaved 1
a 1
disappointed 1
sigh 1
the 1
colonels 1
i 1
heard 1
him 1
whisper 1
to 1
jeff 1
jeff 1
however 1
advanced 1
and 1
bowed 1
in 1
his 1
best 1
manner 1
so 1
did 1
we 1
all 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
saluted 1
civilly 1
by 1
the 1
tall 1
standing 1
women 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
need 1
to 1
make 1
pathetic 1
pantomime 1
of 1
hunger 1
the 1
smaller 1
tables 1
were 1
already 1
laid 1
with 1
food 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
gravely 1
invited 1
to 1
be 1
seated 1
the 1
tables 1
were 1
set 1
for 1
two 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
found 1
ourselves 1
placed 1
vis 1
a 1
vis 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
hosts 1
and 1
each 1
table 1
had 1
five 1
other 1
stalwarts 1
nearby 1
unobtrusively 1
watching 1
we 1
had 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
tired 1
of 1
those 1
women 1
the 1
breakfast 1
was 1
not 1
profuse 1
but 1
sufficient 1
in 1
amount 1
and 1
excellent 1
in 1
quality 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
too 1
good 1
travelers 1
to 1
object 1
to 1
novelty 1
and 1
this 1
repast 1
with 1
its 1
new 1
but 1
delicious 1
fruit 1
its 1
dish 1
of 1
large 1
rich 1
flavored 1
nuts 1
and 1
its 1
highly 1
satisfactory 1
little 1
cakes 1
was 1
most 1
agreeable 1
there 1
was 1
water 1
to 1
drink 1
and 1
a 1
hot 1
beverage 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
pleasing 1
quality 1
some 1
preparation 1
like 1
cocoa 1
and 1
then 1
and 1
there 1
willy 1
nilly 1
before 1
we 1
had 1
satisfied 1
our 1
appetites 1
our 1
education 1
began 1
by 1
each 1
of 1
our 1
plates 1
lay 1
a 1
little 1
book 1
a 1
real 1
printed 1
book 1
though 1
different 1
from 1
ours 1
both 1
in 1
paper 1
and 1
binding 1
as 1
well 1
of 1
course 1
as 1
in 1
type 1
we 1
examined 1
them 1
curiously 1
shades 1
of 1
sauveur 1
muttered 1
terry 1
we 1
re 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
language 1
we 1
were 1
indeed 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
language 1
and 1
not 1
only 1
that 1
but 1
to 1
teach 1
our 1
own 1
there 1
were 1
blank 1
books 1
with 1
parallel 1
columns 1
neatly 1
ruled 1
evidently 1
prepared 1
for 1
the 1
occasion 1
and 1
in 1
these 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
we 1
learned 1
and 1
wrote 1
down 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
anything 1
we 1
were 1
urged 1
to 1
write 1
our 1
own 1
name 1
for 1
it 1
by 1
its 1
side 1
the 1
book 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
study 1
was 1
evidently 1
a 1
schoolbook 1
one 1
in 1
which 1
children 1
learned 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
we 1
judged 1
from 1
this 1
and 1
from 1
their 1
frequent 1
consultation 1
as 1
to 1
methods 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
no 1
previous 1
experience 1
in 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
teaching 1
foreigners 1
their 1
language 1
or 1
of 1
learning 1
any 1
other 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
what 1
they 1
lacked 1
in 1
experience 1
they 1
made 1
up 1
for 1
in 1
genius 1
such 1
subtle 1
understanding 1
such 1
instant 1
recognition 1
of 1
our 1
difficulties 1
and 1
readiness 1
to 1
meet 1
them 1
were 1
a 1
constant 1
surprise 1
to 1
us 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
were 1
willing 1
to 1
meet 1
them 1
halfway 1
it 1
was 1
wholly 1
to 1
our 1
advantage 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
understand 1
and 1
speak 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
as 1
to 1
refusing 1
to 1
teach 1
them 1
why 1
should 1
we 1
later 1
on 1
we 1
did 1
try 1
open 1
rebellion 1
but 1
only 1
once 1
that 1
first 1
meal 1
was 1
pleasant 1
enough 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
quietly 1
studying 1
his 1
companion 1
jeff 1
with 1
sincere 1
admiration 1
terry 1
with 1
that 1
highly 1
technical 1
look 1
of 1
his 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
past 1
master 1
like 1
a 1
lion 1
tamer 1
a 1
serpent 1
charmer 1
or 1
some 1
such 1
professional 1
i 1
myself 1
was 1
intensely 1
interested 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
those 1
sets 1
of 1
five 1
were 1
there 1
to 1
check 1
any 1
outbreak 1
on 1
our 1
part 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
weapons 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
did 1
try 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
damage 1
with 1
a 1
chair 1
say 1
why 1
five 1
to 1
one 1
was 1
too 1
many 1
for 1
us 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
women 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
found 1
out 1
to 1
our 1
sorrow 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
pleasant 1
having 1
them 1
always 1
around 1
but 1
we 1
soon 1
got 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
it 1
s 1
better 1
than 1
being 1
physically 1
restrained 1
ourselves 1
jeff 1
philosophically 1
suggested 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
alone 1
they 1
ve 1
given 1
us 1
a 1
room 1
with 1
no 1
great 1
possibility 1
of 1
escape 1
and 1
personal 1
liberty 1
heavily 1
chaperoned 1
it 1
s 1
better 1
than 1
we 1
d 1
have 1
been 1
likely 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
a 1
man 1
country 1
man 1
country 1
do 1
you 1
really 1
believe 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
men 1
here 1
you 1
innocent 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
know 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
demanded 1
terry 1
ye 1
es 1
jeff 1
agreed 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
yet 1
and 1
yet 1
what 1
come 1
you 1
obdurate 1
sentimentalist 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
thinking 1
about 1
they 1
may 1
have 1
some 1
peculiar 1
division 1
of 1
labor 1
we 1
ve 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
i 1
suggested 1
the 1
men 1
may 1
live 1
in 1
separate 1
towns 1
or 1
they 1
may 1
have 1
subdued 1
them 1
somehow 1
and 1
keep 1
them 1
shut 1
up 1
but 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
that 1
last 1
suggestion 1
of 1
yours 1
is 1
a 1
nice 1
one 1
van 1
terry 1
protested 1
same 1
as 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
us 1
subdued 1
and 1
shut 1
up 1
you 1
make 1
me 1
shiver 1
well 1
figure 1
it 1
out 1
for 1
yourself 1
anyway 1
you 1
please 1
we 1
saw 1
plenty 1
of 1
kids 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
and 1
we 1
ve 1
seen 1
those 1
girls 1
real 1
girls 1
terry 1
agreed 1
in 1
immense 1
relief 1
glad 1
you 1
mentioned 1
em 1
i 1
declare 1
if 1
i 1
thought 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
but 1
those 1
grenadiers 1
i 1
d 1
jump 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
speaking 1
of 1
windows 1
i 1
suggested 1
let 1
s 1
examine 1
ours 1
we 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
windows 1
the 1
blinds 1
opened 1
easily 1
enough 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
bars 1
but 1
the 1
prospect 1
was 1
not 1
reassuring 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
pink 1
walled 1
town 1
we 1
had 1
so 1
rashly 1
entered 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
our 1
chamber 1
was 1
high 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
projecting 1
wing 1
of 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
castle 1
built 1
out 1
on 1
a 1
steep 1
spur 1
of 1
rock 1
immediately 1
below 1
us 1
were 1
gardens 1
fruitful 1
and 1
fragrant 1
but 1
their 1
high 1
walls 1
followed 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
cliff 1
which 1
dropped 1
sheer 1
down 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
how 1
far 1
the 1
distant 1
sound 1
of 1
water 1
suggested 1
a 1
river 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
we 1
could 1
look 1
out 1
east 1
west 1
and 1
south 1
to 1
the 1
southeastward 1
stretched 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
lying 1
bright 1
and 1
fair 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
light 1
but 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
and 1
evidently 1
behind 1
rose 1
great 1
mountains 1
this 1
thing 1
is 1
a 1
regular 1
fortress 1
and 1
no 1
women 1
built 1
it 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
said 1
terry 1
we 1
nodded 1
agreeingly 1
it 1
s 1
right 1
up 1
among 1
the 1
hills 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
brought 1
us 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
we 1
saw 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
swift 1
moving 1
vehicles 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
jeff 1
reminded 1
us 1
if 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
motors 1
they 1
are 1
civilized 1
civilized 1
or 1
not 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
our 1
work 1
cut 1
out 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
here 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
propose 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
rope 1
of 1
bedclothes 1
and 1
try 1
those 1
walls 1
till 1
i 1
m 1
sure 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
better 1
way 1
we 1
all 1
concurred 1
on 1
this 1
point 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
our 1
discussion 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
women 1
jeff 1
continued 1
thoughtful 1
all 1
the 1
same 1
there 1
s 1
something 1
funny 1
about 1
it 1
he 1
urged 1
it 1
isn 1
t 1
just 1
that 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
any 1
men 1
but 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
any 1
signs 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
the 1
reaction 1
of 1
these 1
women 1
is 1
different 1
from 1
any 1
that 1
i 1
ve 1
ever 1
met 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
jeff 1
i 1
agreed 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
different 1
atmosphere 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
notice 1
our 1
being 1
men 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
they 1
treat 1
us 1
well 1
just 1
as 1
they 1
do 1
one 1
another 1
it 1
s 1
as 1
if 1
our 1
being 1
men 1
was 1
a 1
minor 1
incident 1
i 1
nodded 1
i 1
d 1
noticed 1
it 1
myself 1
but 1
terry 1
broke 1
in 1
rudely 1
fiddlesticks 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
s 1
because 1
of 1
their 1
advanced 1
age 1
they 1
re 1
all 1
grandmas 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
or 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
great 1
aunts 1
anyhow 1
those 1
girls 1
were 1
girls 1
all 1
right 1
weren 1
t 1
they 1
yes 1
jeff 1
agreed 1
still 1
slowly 1
but 1
they 1
weren 1
t 1
afraid 1
they 1
flew 1
up 1
that 1
tree 1
and 1
hid 1
like 1
schoolboys 1
caught 1
out 1
of 1
bounds 1
not 1
like 1
shy 1
girls 1
and 1
they 1
ran 1
like 1
marathon 1
winners 1
you 1
ll 1
admit 1
that 1
terry 1
he 1
added 1
terry 1
was 1
moody 1
as 1
the 1
days 1
passed 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
mind 1
our 1
confinement 1
more 1
than 1
jeff 1
or 1
i 1
did 1
and 1
he 1
harped 1
on 1
alima 1
and 1
how 1
near 1
he 1
d 1
come 1
to 1
catching 1
her 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
he 1
would 1
say 1
rather 1
savagely 1
we 1
d 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
hostage 1
and 1
could 1
have 1
made 1
terms 1
but 1
jeff 1
was 1
getting 1
on 1
excellent 1
terms 1
with 1
his 1
tutor 1
and 1
even 1
his 1
guards 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
i 1
it 1
interested 1
me 1
profoundly 1
to 1
note 1
and 1
study 1
the 1
subtle 1
difference 1
between 1
these 1
women 1
and 1
other 1
women 1
and 1
try 1
to 1
account 1
for 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
personal 1
appearance 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
they 1
all 1
wore 1
short 1
hair 1
some 1
few 1
inches 1
at 1
most 1
some 1
curly 1
some 1
not 1
all 1
light 1
and 1
clean 1
and 1
fresh 1
looking 1
if 1
their 1
hair 1
was 1
only 1
long 1
jeff 1
would 1
complain 1
they 1
would 1
look 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
feminine 1
i 1
rather 1
liked 1
it 1
myself 1
after 1
i 1
got 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
why 1
we 1
should 1
so 1
admire 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
crown 1
of 1
hair 1
and 1
not 1
admire 1
a 1
chinaman 1
s 1
queue 1
is 1
hard 1
to 1
explain 1
except 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
so 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
long 1
hair 1
belongs 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
whereas 1
the 1
mane 1
in 1
horses 1
is 1
on 1
both 1
and 1
in 1
lions 1
buffalos 1
and 1
such 1
creatures 1
only 1
on 1
the 1
male 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
miss 1
it 1
at 1
first 1
our 1
time 1
was 1
quite 1
pleasantly 1
filled 1
we 1
were 1
free 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
below 1
our 1
windows 1
quite 1
long 1
in 1
its 1
irregular 1
rambling 1
shape 1
bordering 1
the 1
cliff 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
perfectly 1
smooth 1
and 1
high 1
ending 1
in 1
the 1
masonry 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
studied 1
the 1
great 1
stones 1
i 1
became 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
structure 1
was 1
extremely 1
old 1
it 1
was 1
built 1
like 1
the 1
pre 1
incan 1
architecture 1
in 1
peru 1
of 1
enormous 1
monoliths 1
fitted 1
as 1
closely 1
as 1
mosaics 1
these 1
folks 1
have 1
a 1
history 1
that 1
s 1
sure 1
i 1
told 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
some 1
time 1
they 1
were 1
fighters 1
else 1
why 1
a 1
fortress 1
i 1
said 1
we 1
were 1
free 1
of 1
the 1
garden 1
but 1
not 1
wholly 1
alone 1
in 1
it 1
there 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
string 1
of 1
those 1
uncomfortably 1
strong 1
women 1
sitting 1
about 1
always 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
watching 1
us 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
others 1
were 1
reading 1
playing 1
games 1
or 1
busy 1
at 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
handiwork 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
them 1
knit 1
terry 1
said 1
i 1
can 1
almost 1
call 1
them 1
feminine 1
that 1
doesn 1
t 1
prove 1
anything 1
jeff 1
promptly 1
replied 1
scotch 1
shepherds 1
knit 1
always 1
knitting 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
out 1
terry 1
stretched 1
himself 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
peaks 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
get 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
real 1
women 1
are 1
the 1
mothers 1
and 1
the 1
girls 1
well 1
what 1
ll 1
we 1
do 1
then 1
i 1
asked 1
rather 1
gloomily 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
we 1
ll 1
ever 1
get 1
out 1
this 1
was 1
an 1
unpleasant 1
idea 1
which 1
we 1
unanimously 1
considered 1
returning 1
with 1
earnestness 1
to 1
our 1
studies 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
good 1
boys 1
and 1
learn 1
our 1
lessons 1
well 1
i 1
suggested 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
quiet 1
and 1
respectful 1
and 1
polite 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
us 1
then 1
perhaps 1
they 1
will 1
let 1
us 1
out 1
and 1
anyway 1
when 1
we 1
do 1
escape 1
it 1
is 1
of 1
immense 1
importance 1
that 1
we 1
know 1
the 1
language 1
personally 1
i 1
was 1
tremendously 1
interested 1
in 1
that 1
language 1
and 1
seeing 1
they 1
had 1
books 1
was 1
eager 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
them 1
to 1
dig 1
into 1
their 1
history 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
one 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
speak 1
smooth 1
and 1
pleasant 1
to 1
the 1
ear 1
and 1
so 1
easy 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
write 1
that 1
i 1
marveled 1
at 1
it 1
they 1
had 1
an 1
absolutely 1
phonetic 1
system 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
was 1
as 1
scientific 1
as 1
esparanto 1
yet 1
bore 1
all 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
rich 1
civilization 1
we 1
were 1
free 1
to 1
study 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
wished 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
left 1
merely 1
to 1
wander 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
for 1
recreation 1
but 1
introduced 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
gymnasium 1
partly 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
and 1
partly 1
in 1
the 1
story 1
below 1
here 1
we 1
learned 1
real 1
respect 1
for 1
our 1
tall 1
guards 1
no 1
change 1
of 1
costume 1
was 1
needed 1
for 1
this 1
work 1
save 1
to 1
lay 1
off 1
outer 1
clothing 1
the 1
first 1
one 1
was 1
as 1
perfect 1
a 1
garment 1
for 1
exercise 1
as 1
need 1
be 1
devised 1
absolutely 1
free 1
to 1
move 1
in 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
admit 1
much 1
better 1
looking 1
than 1
our 1
usual 1
one 1
forty 1
over 1
forty 1
some 1
of 1
em 1
fifty 1
i 1
bet 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
em 1
grumbled 1
terry 1
in 1
reluctant 1
admiration 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
spectacular 1
acrobatics 1
such 1
as 1
only 1
the 1
young 1
can 1
perform 1
but 1
for 1
all 1
around 1
development 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
most 1
excellent 1
system 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
music 1
went 1
with 1
it 1
with 1
posture 1
dancing 1
and 1
sometimes 1
gravely 1
beautiful 1
processional 1
performances 1
jeff 1
was 1
much 1
impressed 1
by 1
it 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
then 1
how 1
small 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
their 1
physical 1
culture 1
methods 1
this 1
really 1
was 1
but 1
found 1
it 1
agreeable 1
to 1
watch 1
and 1
to 1
take 1
part 1
in 1
oh 1
yes 1
we 1
took 1
part 1
all 1
right 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
absolutely 1
compulsory 1
but 1
we 1
thought 1
it 1
better 1
to 1
please 1
terry 1
was 1
the 1
strongest 1
of 1
us 1
though 1
i 1
was 1
wiry 1
and 1
had 1
good 1
staying 1
power 1
and 1
jeff 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
sprinter 1
and 1
hurdler 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
those 1
old 1
ladies 1
gave 1
us 1
cards 1
and 1
spades 1
they 1
ran 1
like 1
deer 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
mean 1
that 1
they 1
ran 1
not 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
performance 1
but 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
their 1
natural 1
gait 1
we 1
remembered 1
those 1
fleeting 1
girls 1
of 1
our 1
first 1
bright 1
adventure 1
and 1
concluded 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
they 1
leaped 1
like 1
deer 1
too 1
with 1
a 1
quick 1
folding 1
motion 1
of 1
the 1
legs 1
drawn 1
up 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
with 1
a 1
sidelong 1
twist 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
sprawling 1
spread 1
eagle 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
fellows 1
used 1
to 1
come 1
over 1
the 1
line 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
trick 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
easily 1
catch 1
up 1
with 1
these 1
experts 1
however 1
never 1
thought 1
i 1
d 1
live 1
to 1
be 1
bossed 1
by 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
elderly 1
lady 1
acrobats 1
terry 1
protested 1
they 1
had 1
games 1
too 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
we 1
found 1
them 1
rather 1
uninteresting 1
at 1
first 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
two 1
people 1
playing 1
solitaire 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
would 1
get 1
it 1
first 1
more 1
like 1
a 1
race 1
or 1
a 1
a 1
competitive 1
examination 1
than 1
a 1
real 1
game 1
with 1
some 1
fight 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
philosophized 1
a 1
bit 1
over 1
this 1
and 1
told 1
terry 1
it 1
argued 1
against 1
their 1
having 1
any 1
men 1
about 1
there 1
isn 1
t 1
a 1
man 1
size 1
game 1
in 1
the 1
lot 1
i 1
said 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
interesting 1
i 1
like 1
them 1
jeff 1
objected 1
and 1
i 1
m 1
sure 1
they 1
are 1
educational 1
i 1
m 1
sick 1
and 1
tired 1
of 1
being 1
educated 1
terry 1
protested 1
fancy 1
going 1
to 1
a 1
dame 1
school 1
at 1
our 1
age 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
out 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
being 1
educated 1
swiftly 1
our 1
special 1
tutors 1
rose 1
rapidly 1
in 1
our 1
esteem 1
they 1
seemed 1
of 1
rather 1
finer 1
quality 1
than 1
the 1
guards 1
though 1
all 1
were 1
on 1
terms 1
of 1
easy 1
friendliness 1
mine 1
was 1
named 1
somel 1
jeff 1
s 1
zava 1
and 1
terry 1
s 1
moadine 1
we 1
tried 1
to 1
generalize 1
from 1
the 1
names 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
guards 1
and 1
of 1
our 1
three 1
girls 1
but 1
got 1
nowhere 1
they 1
sound 1
well 1
enough 1
and 1
they 1
re 1
mostly 1
short 1
but 1
there 1
s 1
no 1
similarity 1
of 1
termination 1
and 1
no 1
two 1
alike 1
however 1
our 1
acquaintance 1
is 1
limited 1
as 1
yet 1
there 1
were 1
many 1
things 1
we 1
meant 1
to 1
ask 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
talk 1
well 1
enough 1
better 1
teaching 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
from 1
morning 1
to 1
night 1
there 1
was 1
somel 1
always 1
on 1
call 1
except 1
between 1
two 1
and 1
four 1
always 1
pleasant 1
with 1
a 1
steady 1
friendly 1
kindness 1
that 1
i 1
grew 1
to 1
enjoy 1
very 1
much 1
jeff 1
said 1
miss 1
zava 1
he 1
would 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
title 1
though 1
they 1
apparently 1
had 1
none 1
was 1
a 1
darling 1
that 1
she 1
reminded 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
aunt 1
esther 1
at 1
home 1
but 1
terry 1
refused 1
to 1
be 1
won 1
and 1
rather 1
jeered 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
companion 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
alone 1
i 1
m 1
sick 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
protested 1
sick 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
here 1
we 1
are 1
cooped 1
up 1
as 1
helpless 1
as 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
three 1
year 1
old 1
orphans 1
and 1
being 1
taught 1
what 1
they 1
think 1
is 1
necessary 1
whether 1
we 1
like 1
it 1
or 1
not 1
confound 1
their 1
old 1
maid 1
impudence 1
nevertheless 1
we 1
were 1
taught 1
they 1
brought 1
in 1
a 1
raised 1
map 1
of 1
their 1
country 1
beautifully 1
made 1
and 1
increased 1
our 1
knowledge 1
of 1
geographical 1
terms 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
inquired 1
for 1
information 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
outside 1
they 1
smilingly 1
shook 1
their 1
heads 1
they 1
brought 1
pictures 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
engravings 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
but 1
colored 1
studies 1
of 1
plants 1
and 1
trees 1
and 1
flowers 1
and 1
birds 1
they 1
brought 1
tools 1
and 1
various 1
small 1
objects 1
we 1
had 1
plenty 1
of 1
material 1
in 1
our 1
school 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
for 1
terry 1
we 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
much 1
more 1
contented 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
weeks 1
ran 1
into 1
months 1
he 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
irritable 1
don 1
t 1
act 1
like 1
a 1
bear 1
with 1
a 1
sore 1
head 1
i 1
begged 1
him 1
we 1
re 1
getting 1
on 1
finely 1
every 1
day 1
we 1
can 1
understand 1
them 1
better 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
we 1
can 1
make 1
a 1
reasonable 1
plea 1
to 1
be 1
let 1
out 1
let 1
out 1
he 1
stormed 1
let 1
out 1
like 1
children 1
kept 1
after 1
school 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
and 1
i 1
m 1
going 1
to 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
this 1
place 1
and 1
fight 1
or 1
the 1
girls 1
guess 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
girls 1
you 1
re 1
most 1
interested 1
in 1
jeff 1
commented 1
what 1
are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
fight 1
with 1
your 1
fists 1
yes 1
or 1
sticks 1
and 1
stones 1
i 1
d 1
just 1
like 1
to 1
and 1
terry 1
squared 1
off 1
and 1
tapped 1
jeff 1
softly 1
on 1
the 1
jaw 1
just 1
for 1
instance 1
he 1
said 1
anyhow 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
we 1
could 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
machine 1
and 1
clear 1
out 1
if 1
it 1
s 1
there 1
i 1
cautiously 1
suggested 1
oh 1
don 1
t 1
croak 1
van 1
if 1
it 1
isn 1
t 1
there 1
we 1
ll 1
find 1
our 1
way 1
down 1
somehow 1
the 1
boat 1
s 1
there 1
i 1
guess 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
on 1
terry 1
so 1
hard 1
that 1
he 1
finally 1
persuaded 1
us 1
to 1
consider 1
a 1
plan 1
of 1
escape 1
it 1
was 1
difficult 1
it 1
was 1
highly 1
dangerous 1
but 1
he 1
declared 1
that 1
he 1
d 1
go 1
alone 1
if 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
go 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
it 1
appeared 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
pretty 1
careful 1
study 1
of 1
the 1
environment 1
from 1
our 1
end 1
window 1
that 1
faced 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
the 1
promontory 1
we 1
could 1
get 1
a 1
fair 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
stretch 1
of 1
wall 1
and 1
the 1
drop 1
below 1
also 1
from 1
the 1
roof 1
we 1
could 1
make 1
out 1
more 1
and 1
even 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
glimpse 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
path 1
below 1
the 1
wall 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
three 1
things 1
he 1
said 1
ropes 1
agility 1
and 1
not 1
being 1
seen 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
hardest 1
part 1
i 1
urged 1
still 1
hoping 1
to 1
dissuade 1
him 1
one 1
or 1
another 1
pair 1
of 1
eyes 1
is 1
on 1
us 1
every 1
minute 1
except 1
at 1
night 1
therefore 1
we 1
must 1
do 1
it 1
at 1
night 1
he 1
answered 1
that 1
s 1
easy 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
catch 1
us 1
we 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
well 1
treated 1
afterward 1
said 1
jeff 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
business 1
risk 1
we 1
must 1
take 1
i 1
m 1
going 1
if 1
i 1
break 1
my 1
neck 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
changing 1
him 1
the 1
rope 1
problem 1
was 1
not 1
easy 1
something 1
strong 1
enough 1
to 1
hold 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
long 1
enough 1
to 1
let 1
us 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
then 1
down 1
over 1
the 1
wall 1
there 1
were 1
plenty 1
of 1
strong 1
ropes 1
in 1
the 1
gymnasium 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
love 1
to 1
swing 1
and 1
climb 1
on 1
them 1
but 1
we 1
were 1
never 1
there 1
by 1
ourselves 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
piece 1
it 1
out 1
from 1
our 1
bedding 1
rugs 1
and 1
garments 1
and 1
moreover 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
after 1
we 1
were 1
shut 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
for 1
every 1
day 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
cleaned 1
to 1
perfection 1
by 1
two 1
of 1
our 1
guardians 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
shears 1
no 1
knives 1
but 1
terry 1
was 1
resourceful 1
these 1
jennies 1
have 1
glass 1
and 1
china 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
ll 1
break 1
a 1
glass 1
from 1
the 1
bathroom 1
and 1
use 1
that 1
love 1
will 1
find 1
out 1
a 1
way 1
he 1
hummed 1
when 1
we 1
re 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
we 1
ll 1
stand 1
three 1
man 1
high 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
rope 1
as 1
far 1
up 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
reach 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
have 1
more 1
for 1
the 1
wall 1
i 1
know 1
just 1
where 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
bit 1
of 1
path 1
below 1
and 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
big 1
tree 1
there 1
too 1
or 1
a 1
vine 1
or 1
something 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
leaves 1
it 1
seemed 1
a 1
crazy 1
risk 1
to 1
take 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
terry 1
s 1
expedition 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
tired 1
of 1
our 1
imprisonment 1
so 1
we 1
waited 1
for 1
full 1
moon 1
retired 1
early 1
and 1
spent 1
an 1
anxious 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
unskilled 1
manufacture 1
of 1
man 1
strong 1
ropes 1
to 1
retire 1
into 1
the 1
depths 1
of 1
the 1
closet 1
muffle 1
a 1
glass 1
in 1
thick 1
cloth 1
and 1
break 1
it 1
without 1
noise 1
was 1
not 1
difficult 1
and 1
broken 1
glass 1
will 1
cut 1
though 1
not 1
as 1
deftly 1
as 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
scissors 1
the 1
broad 1
moonlight 1
streamed 1
in 1
through 1
four 1
of 1
our 1
windows 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
dared 1
leave 1
our 1
lights 1
on 1
too 1
long 1
and 1
we 1
worked 1
hard 1
and 1
fast 1
at 1
our 1
task 1
of 1
destruction 1
hangings 1
rugs 1
robes 1
towels 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
bed 1
furniture 1
even 1
the 1
mattress 1
covers 1
we 1
left 1
not 1
one 1
stitch 1
upon 1
another 1
as 1
jeff 1
put 1
it 1
then 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
window 1
as 1
less 1
liable 1
to 1
observation 1
we 1
fastened 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
our 1
cable 1
strongly 1
to 1
the 1
firm 1
set 1
hinge 1
of 1
the 1
inner 1
blind 1
and 1
dropped 1
our 1
coiled 1
bundle 1
of 1
rope 1
softly 1
over 1
this 1
part 1
s 1
easy 1
enough 1
i 1
ll 1
come 1
last 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
cut 1
the 1
rope 1
said 1
terry 1
so 1
i 1
slipped 1
down 1
first 1
and 1
stood 1
well 1
braced 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
then 1
jeff 1
on 1
my 1
shoulders 1
then 1
terry 1
who 1
shook 1
us 1
a 1
little 1
as 1
he 1
sawed 1
through 1
the 1
cord 1
above 1
his 1
head 1
then 1
i 1
slowly 1
dropped 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
jeff 1
following 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
we 1
all 1
three 1
stood 1
safe 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
with 1
most 1
of 1
our 1
rope 1
with 1
us 1
good 1
bye 1
grandma 1
whispered 1
terry 1
under 1
his 1
breath 1
and 1
we 1
crept 1
softly 1
toward 1
the 1
wall 1
taking 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
every 1
bush 1
and 1
tree 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
foresighted 1
enough 1
to 1
mark 1
the 1
very 1
spot 1
only 1
a 1
scratch 1
of 1
stone 1
on 1
stone 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
to 1
read 1
in 1
that 1
light 1
for 1
anchorage 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
tough 1
fair 1
sized 1
shrub 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
now 1
i 1
ll 1
climb 1
up 1
on 1
you 1
two 1
again 1
and 1
go 1
over 1
first 1
said 1
terry 1
that 1
ll 1
hold 1
the 1
rope 1
firm 1
till 1
you 1
both 1
get 1
up 1
on 1
top 1
then 1
i 1
ll 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
off 1
safely 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
follow 1
or 1
say 1
i 1
ll 1
twitch 1
it 1
three 1
times 1
if 1
i 1
find 1
there 1
s 1
absolutely 1
no 1
footing 1
why 1
i 1
ll 1
climb 1
up 1
again 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
they 1
ll 1
kill 1
us 1
from 1
the 1
top 1
he 1
reconnoitered 1
carefully 1
waved 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
whispered 1
ok 1
then 1
slipped 1
over 1
jeff 1
climbed 1
up 1
and 1
i 1
followed 1
and 1
we 1
rather 1
shivered 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
far 1
down 1
that 1
swaying 1
wavering 1
figure 1
dropped 1
hand 1
under 1
hand 1
till 1
it 1
disappeared 1
in 1
a 1
mass 1
of 1
foliage 1
far 1
below 1
then 1
there 1
were 1
three 1
quick 1
pulls 1
and 1
jeff 1
and 1
i 1
not 1
without 1
a 1
joyous 1
sense 1
of 1
recovered 1
freedom 1
successfully 1
followed 1
our 1
leader 1
chapter 1
4 1
our 1
venture 1
we 1
were 1
standing 1
on 1
a 1
narrow 1
irregular 1
all 1
too 1
slanting 1
little 1
ledge 1
and 1
should 1
doubtless 1
have 1
ignominiously 1
slipped 1
off 1
and 1
broken 1
our 1
rash 1
necks 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
vine 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
thick 1
leaved 1
wide 1
spreading 1
thing 1
a 1
little 1
like 1
amphelopsis 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
quite 1
vertical 1
here 1
you 1
see 1
said 1
terry 1
full 1
of 1
pride 1
and 1
enthusiasm 1
this 1
thing 1
never 1
would 1
hold 1
our 1
direct 1
weight 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
if 1
we 1
sort 1
of 1
slide 1
down 1
on 1
it 1
one 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
sticking 1
in 1
with 1
hands 1
and 1
feet 1
we 1
ll 1
reach 1
that 1
next 1
ledge 1
alive 1
as 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
our 1
rope 1
again 1
and 1
can 1
t 1
comfortably 1
stay 1
here 1
i 1
approve 1
said 1
jeff 1
solemnly 1
terry 1
slid 1
down 1
first 1
said 1
he 1
d 1
show 1
us 1
how 1
a 1
christian 1
meets 1
his 1
death 1
luck 1
was 1
with 1
us 1
we 1
had 1
put 1
on 1
the 1
thickest 1
of 1
those 1
intermediate 1
suits 1
leaving 1
our 1
tunics 1
behind 1
and 1
made 1
this 1
scramble 1
quite 1
successfully 1
though 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
pretty 1
heavy 1
fall 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
and 1
was 1
only 1
kept 1
on 1
the 1
second 1
ledge 1
by 1
main 1
force 1
the 1
next 1
stage 1
was 1
down 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
chimney 1
a 1
long 1
irregular 1
fissure 1
and 1
so 1
with 1
scratches 1
many 1
and 1
painful 1
and 1
bruises 1
not 1
a 1
few 1
we 1
finally 1
reached 1
the 1
stream 1
it 1
was 1
darker 1
there 1
but 1
we 1
felt 1
it 1
highly 1
necessary 1
to 1
put 1
as 1
much 1
distance 1
as 1
possible 1
behind 1
us 1
so 1
we 1
waded 1
jumped 1
and 1
clambered 1
down 1
that 1
rocky 1
riverbed 1
in 1
the 1
flickering 1
black 1
and 1
white 1
moonlight 1
and 1
leaf 1
shadow 1
till 1
growing 1
daylight 1
forced 1
a 1
halt 1
we 1
found 1
a 1
friendly 1
nut 1
tree 1
those 1
large 1
satisfying 1
soft 1
shelled 1
nuts 1
we 1
already 1
knew 1
so 1
well 1
and 1
filled 1
our 1
pockets 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
remarked 1
that 1
these 1
women 1
had 1
pockets 1
in 1
surprising 1
number 1
and 1
variety 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
all 1
their 1
garments 1
and 1
the 1
middle 1
one 1
in 1
particular 1
was 1
shingled 1
with 1
them 1
so 1
we 1
stocked 1
up 1
with 1
nuts 1
till 1
we 1
bulged 1
like 1
prussian 1
privates 1
in 1
marching 1
order 1
drank 1
all 1
we 1
could 1
hold 1
and 1
retired 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
comfortable 1
place 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
easy 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
just 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
crevice 1
high 1
up 1
along 1
the 1
steep 1
bank 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
well 1
veiled 1
with 1
foliage 1
and 1
dry 1
after 1
our 1
exhaustive 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
hour 1
scramble 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
breakfast 1
food 1
we 1
all 1
lay 1
down 1
along 1
that 1
crack 1
heads 1
and 1
tails 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
and 1
slept 1
till 1
the 1
afternoon 1
sun 1
almost 1
toasted 1
our 1
faces 1
terry 1
poked 1
a 1
tentative 1
foot 1
against 1
my 1
head 1
how 1
are 1
you 1
van 1
alive 1
yet 1
very 1
much 1
so 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
and 1
jeff 1
was 1
equally 1
cheerful 1
we 1
had 1
room 1
to 1
stretch 1
if 1
not 1
to 1
turn 1
around 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
very 1
carefully 1
roll 1
over 1
one 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
behind 1
the 1
sheltering 1
foliage 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
leave 1
there 1
by 1
daylight 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
but 1
enough 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
now 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
the 1
cultivated 1
area 1
and 1
no 1
doubt 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
alarm 1
sent 1
out 1
far 1
and 1
wide 1
terry 1
chuckled 1
softly 1
to 1
himself 1
lying 1
there 1
on 1
that 1
hot 1
narrow 1
little 1
rim 1
of 1
rock 1
he 1
dilated 1
on 1
the 1
discomfiture 1
of 1
our 1
guards 1
and 1
tutors 1
making 1
many 1
discourteous 1
remarks 1
i 1
reminded 1
him 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
still 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
to 1
go 1
before 1
getting 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
we 1
d 1
left 1
our 1
machine 1
and 1
no 1
probability 1
of 1
finding 1
it 1
there 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
kicked 1
me 1
mildly 1
for 1
a 1
croaker 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
boost 1
don 1
t 1
knock 1
he 1
protested 1
i 1
never 1
said 1
twould 1
be 1
a 1
picnic 1
but 1
i 1
d 1
run 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
antarctic 1
ice 1
fields 1
rather 1
than 1
be 1
a 1
prisoner 1
we 1
soon 1
dozed 1
off 1
again 1
the 1
long 1
rest 1
and 1
penetrating 1
dry 1
heat 1
were 1
good 1
for 1
us 1
and 1
that 1
night 1
we 1
covered 1
a 1
considerable 1
distance 1
keeping 1
always 1
in 1
the 1
rough 1
forested 1
belt 1
of 1
land 1
which 1
we 1
knew 1
bordered 1
the 1
whole 1
country 1
sometimes 1
we 1
were 1
near 1
the 1
outer 1
edge 1
and 1
caught 1
sudden 1
glimpses 1
of 1
the 1
tremendous 1
depths 1
beyond 1
this 1
piece 1
of 1
geography 1
stands 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
basalt 1
column 1
jeff 1
said 1
nice 1
time 1
we 1
ll 1
have 1
getting 1
down 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
confiscated 1
our 1
machine 1
for 1
which 1
suggestion 1
he 1
received 1
summary 1
chastisement 1
what 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
inland 1
was 1
peaceable 1
enough 1
but 1
only 1
moonlit 1
glimpses 1
by 1
daylight 1
we 1
lay 1
very 1
close 1
as 1
terry 1
said 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
kill 1
the 1
old 1
ladies 1
even 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
and 1
short 1
of 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
perfectly 1
competent 1
to 1
pick 1
us 1
up 1
bodily 1
and 1
carry 1
us 1
back 1
if 1
discovered 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
to 1
lie 1
low 1
and 1
sneak 1
out 1
unseen 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
do 1
it 1
there 1
wasn 1
t 1
much 1
talking 1
done 1
at 1
night 1
we 1
had 1
our 1
marathon 1
obstacle 1
race 1
we 1
stayed 1
not 1
for 1
brake 1
and 1
we 1
stopped 1
not 1
for 1
stone 1
and 1
swam 1
whatever 1
water 1
was 1
too 1
deep 1
to 1
wade 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
got 1
around 1
but 1
that 1
was 1
only 1
necessary 1
twice 1
by 1
day 1
sleep 1
sound 1
and 1
sweet 1
mighty 1
lucky 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
live 1
off 1
the 1
country 1
as 1
we 1
did 1
even 1
that 1
margin 1
of 1
forest 1
seemed 1
rich 1
in 1
foodstuffs 1
but 1
jeff 1
thoughtfully 1
suggested 1
that 1
that 1
very 1
thing 1
showed 1
how 1
careful 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
we 1
might 1
run 1
into 1
some 1
stalwart 1
group 1
of 1
gardeners 1
or 1
foresters 1
or 1
nut 1
gatherers 1
at 1
any 1
minute 1
careful 1
we 1
were 1
feeling 1
pretty 1
sure 1
that 1
if 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
make 1
good 1
this 1
time 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
have 1
another 1
opportunity 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
we 1
reached 1
a 1
point 1
from 1
which 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
far 1
below 1
the 1
broad 1
stretch 1
of 1
that 1
still 1
lake 1
from 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
made 1
our 1
ascent 1
that 1
looks 1
pretty 1
good 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
terry 1
gazing 1
down 1
at 1
it 1
now 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
find 1
the 1
plane 1
we 1
know 1
where 1
to 1
aim 1
if 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
drop 1
over 1
this 1
wall 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
the 1
wall 1
at 1
that 1
point 1
was 1
singularly 1
uninviting 1
it 1
rose 1
so 1
straight 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
put 1
our 1
heads 1
over 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
base 1
and 1
the 1
country 1
below 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
far 1
off 1
marshy 1
tangle 1
of 1
rank 1
vegetation 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
to 1
risk 1
our 1
necks 1
to 1
that 1
extent 1
however 1
for 1
at 1
last 1
stealing 1
along 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
and 1
trees 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
creeping 1
savages 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
that 1
flat 1
space 1
where 1
we 1
had 1
landed 1
and 1
there 1
in 1
unbelievable 1
good 1
fortune 1
we 1
found 1
our 1
machine 1
covered 1
too 1
by 1
jingo 1
would 1
you 1
think 1
they 1
had 1
that 1
much 1
sense 1
cried 1
terry 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
that 1
much 1
they 1
re 1
likely 1
to 1
have 1
more 1
i 1
warned 1
him 1
softly 1
bet 1
you 1
the 1
thing 1
s 1
watched 1
we 1
reconnoitered 1
as 1
widely 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
in 1
the 1
failing 1
moonlight 1
moons 1
are 1
of 1
a 1
painfully 1
unreliable 1
nature 1
but 1
the 1
growing 1
dawn 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
familiar 1
shape 1
shrouded 1
in 1
some 1
heavy 1
cloth 1
like 1
canvas 1
and 1
no 1
slightest 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
watchman 1
near 1
we 1
decided 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
quick 1
dash 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
light 1
was 1
strong 1
enough 1
for 1
accurate 1
work 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
if 1
the 1
old 1
thing 1
ll 1
go 1
or 1
not 1
terry 1
declared 1
we 1
can 1
run 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
get 1
aboard 1
and 1
just 1
plane 1
down 1
plop 1
beside 1
our 1
boat 1
there 1
look 1
there 1
see 1
the 1
boat 1
sure 1
enough 1
there 1
was 1
our 1
motor 1
lying 1
like 1
a 1
gray 1
cocoon 1
on 1
the 1
flat 1
pale 1
sheet 1
of 1
water 1
quietly 1
but 1
swiftly 1
we 1
rushed 1
forward 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
tug 1
at 1
the 1
fastenings 1
of 1
that 1
cover 1
confound 1
the 1
thing 1
terry 1
cried 1
in 1
desperate 1
impatience 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
it 1
sewed 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
bag 1
and 1
we 1
ve 1
not 1
a 1
knife 1
among 1
us 1
then 1
as 1
we 1
tugged 1
and 1
pulled 1
at 1
that 1
tough 1
cloth 1
we 1
heard 1
a 1
sound 1
that 1
made 1
terry 1
lift 1
his 1
head 1
like 1
a 1
war 1
horse 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
an 1
unmistakable 1
giggle 1
yes 1
three 1
giggles 1
there 1
they 1
were 1
celis 1
alima 1
ellador 1
looking 1
just 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
when 1
we 1
first 1
saw 1
them 1
standing 1
a 1
little 1
way 1
off 1
from 1
us 1
as 1
interested 1
as 1
mischievous 1
as 1
three 1
schoolboys 1
hold 1
on 1
terry 1
hold 1
on 1
i 1
warned 1
that 1
s 1
too 1
easy 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
trap 1
let 1
us 1
appeal 1
to 1
their 1
kind 1
hearts 1
jeff 1
urged 1
i 1
think 1
they 1
will 1
help 1
us 1
perhaps 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
knives 1
it 1
s 1
no 1
use 1
rushing 1
them 1
anyhow 1
i 1
was 1
absolutely 1
holding 1
on 1
to 1
terry 1
we 1
know 1
they 1
can 1
out 1
run 1
and 1
out 1
climb 1
us 1
he 1
reluctantly 1
admitted 1
this 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
brief 1
parley 1
among 1
ourselves 1
we 1
all 1
advanced 1
slowly 1
toward 1
them 1
holding 1
out 1
our 1
hands 1
in 1
token 1
of 1
friendliness 1
they 1
stood 1
their 1
ground 1
till 1
we 1
had 1
come 1
fairly 1
near 1
and 1
then 1
indicated 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
stop 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
we 1
advanced 1
a 1
step 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
they 1
promptly 1
and 1
swiftly 1
withdrew 1
so 1
we 1
stopped 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
specified 1
then 1
we 1
used 1
their 1
language 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
able 1
to 1
explain 1
our 1
plight 1
telling 1
how 1
we 1
were 1
imprisoned 1
how 1
we 1
had 1
escaped 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
pantomime 1
here 1
and 1
vivid 1
interest 1
on 1
their 1
part 1
how 1
we 1
had 1
traveled 1
by 1
night 1
and 1
hidden 1
by 1
day 1
living 1
on 1
nuts 1
and 1
here 1
terry 1
pretended 1
great 1
hunger 1
i 1
know 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
hungry 1
we 1
had 1
found 1
plenty 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
sparing 1
in 1
helping 1
ourselves 1
but 1
they 1
seemed 1
somewhat 1
impressed 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
murmured 1
consultation 1
they 1
produced 1
from 1
their 1
pockets 1
certain 1
little 1
packages 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
ease 1
and 1
accuracy 1
tossed 1
them 1
into 1
our 1
hands 1
jeff 1
was 1
most 1
appreciative 1
of 1
this 1
and 1
terry 1
made 1
extravagant 1
gestures 1
of 1
admiration 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
set 1
them 1
off 1
boy 1
fashion 1
to 1
show 1
their 1
skill 1
while 1
we 1
ate 1
the 1
excellent 1
biscuits 1
they 1
had 1
thrown 1
us 1
and 1
while 1
ellador 1
kept 1
a 1
watchful 1
eye 1
on 1
our 1
movements 1
celis 1
ran 1
off 1
to 1
some 1
distance 1
and 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
duck 1
on 1
a 1
rock 1
arrangement 1
a 1
big 1
yellow 1
nut 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
three 1
balanced 1
sticks 1
alima 1
meanwhile 1
gathering 1
stones 1
they 1
urged 1
us 1
to 1
throw 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
we 1
did 1
but 1
the 1
thing 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
off 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
after 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
failures 1
at 1
which 1
those 1
elvish 1
damsels 1
laughed 1
delightedly 1
that 1
jeff 1
succeeded 1
in 1
bringing 1
the 1
whole 1
structure 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
it 1
took 1
me 1
still 1
longer 1
and 1
terry 1
to 1
his 1
intense 1
annoyance 1
came 1
third 1
then 1
celis 1
set 1
up 1
the 1
little 1
tripod 1
again 1
and 1
looked 1
back 1
at 1
us 1
knocking 1
it 1
down 1
pointing 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
shaking 1
her 1
short 1
curls 1
severely 1
no 1
she 1
said 1
bad 1
wrong 1
we 1
were 1
quite 1
able 1
to 1
follow 1
her 1
then 1
she 1
set 1
it 1
up 1
once 1
more 1
put 1
the 1
fat 1
nut 1
on 1
top 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
there 1
those 1
aggravating 1
girls 1
sat 1
and 1
took 1
turns 1
throwing 1
little 1
stones 1
at 1
that 1
thing 1
while 1
one 1
stayed 1
by 1
as 1
a 1
setter 1
up 1
and 1
they 1
just 1
popped 1
that 1
nut 1
off 1
two 1
times 1
out 1
of 1
three 1
without 1
upsetting 1
the 1
sticks 1
pleased 1
as 1
punch 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
and 1
we 1
pretended 1
to 1
be 1
but 1
weren 1
t 1
we 1
got 1
very 1
friendly 1
over 1
this 1
game 1
but 1
i 1
told 1
terry 1
we 1
d 1
be 1
sorry 1
if 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
get 1
off 1
while 1
we 1
could 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
begged 1
for 1
knives 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
show 1
what 1
we 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
they 1
each 1
proudly 1
produced 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
strong 1
clasp 1
knife 1
from 1
their 1
pockets 1
yes 1
we 1
said 1
eagerly 1
that 1
s 1
it 1
please 1
we 1
had 1
learned 1
quite 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
their 1
language 1
you 1
see 1
and 1
we 1
just 1
begged 1
for 1
those 1
knives 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
give 1
them 1
to 1
us 1
if 1
we 1
came 1
a 1
step 1
too 1
near 1
they 1
backed 1
off 1
standing 1
light 1
and 1
eager 1
for 1
flight 1
it 1
s 1
no 1
sort 1
of 1
use 1
i 1
said 1
come 1
on 1
let 1
s 1
get 1
a 1
sharp 1
stone 1
or 1
something 1
we 1
must 1
get 1
this 1
thing 1
off 1
so 1
we 1
hunted 1
about 1
and 1
found 1
what 1
edged 1
fragments 1
we 1
could 1
and 1
hacked 1
away 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
trying 1
to 1
cut 1
sailcloth 1
with 1
a 1
clamshell 1
terry 1
hacked 1
and 1
dug 1
but 1
said 1
to 1
us 1
under 1
his 1
breath 1
boys 1
we 1
re 1
in 1
pretty 1
good 1
condition 1
let 1
s 1
make 1
a 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
dash 1
and 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
those 1
girls 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
they 1
had 1
drawn 1
rather 1
nearer 1
to 1
watch 1
our 1
efforts 1
and 1
we 1
did 1
take 1
them 1
rather 1
by 1
surprise 1
also 1
as 1
terry 1
said 1
our 1
recent 1
training 1
had 1
strengthened 1
us 1
in 1
wind 1
and 1
limb 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
desperate 1
moments 1
those 1
girls 1
were 1
scared 1
and 1
we 1
almost 1
triumphant 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
we 1
stretched 1
out 1
our 1
hands 1
the 1
distance 1
between 1
us 1
widened 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
their 1
pace 1
apparently 1
and 1
then 1
though 1
we 1
ran 1
at 1
our 1
utmost 1
speed 1
and 1
much 1
farther 1
than 1
i 1
thought 1
wise 1
they 1
kept 1
just 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
stopped 1
breathless 1
at 1
last 1
at 1
my 1
repeated 1
admonitions 1
this 1
is 1
stark 1
foolishness 1
i 1
urged 1
they 1
are 1
doing 1
it 1
on 1
purpose 1
come 1
back 1
or 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
sorry 1
we 1
went 1
back 1
much 1
slower 1
than 1
we 1
came 1
and 1
in 1
truth 1
we 1
were 1
sorry 1
as 1
we 1
reached 1
our 1
swaddled 1
machine 1
and 1
sought 1
again 1
to 1
tear 1
loose 1
its 1
covering 1
there 1
rose 1
up 1
from 1
all 1
around 1
the 1
sturdy 1
forms 1
the 1
quiet 1
determined 1
faces 1
we 1
knew 1
so 1
well 1
oh 1
lord 1
groaned 1
terry 1
the 1
colonels 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
up 1
they 1
re 1
forty 1
to 1
one 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
fight 1
these 1
women 1
evidently 1
relied 1
on 1
numbers 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
drilled 1
force 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
multitude 1
actuated 1
by 1
a 1
common 1
impulse 1
they 1
showed 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
fear 1
and 1
since 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
weapons 1
whatever 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
hundred 1
of 1
them 1
standing 1
ten 1
deep 1
about 1
us 1
we 1
gave 1
in 1
as 1
gracefully 1
as 1
we 1
might 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
looked 1
for 1
punishment 1
a 1
closer 1
imprisonment 1
solitary 1
confinement 1
maybe 1
but 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
happened 1
they 1
treated 1
us 1
as 1
truants 1
only 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
quite 1
understood 1
our 1
truancy 1
back 1
we 1
went 1
not 1
under 1
an 1
anesthetic 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
skimming 1
along 1
in 1
electric 1
motors 1
enough 1
like 1
ours 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
recognizable 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
separate 1
vehicle 1
with 1
one 1
able 1
bodied 1
lady 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
and 1
three 1
facing 1
him 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
pleasant 1
enough 1
and 1
talked 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
was 1
possible 1
with 1
our 1
limited 1
powers 1
and 1
though 1
terry 1
was 1
keenly 1
mortified 1
and 1
at 1
first 1
we 1
all 1
rather 1
dreaded 1
harsh 1
treatment 1
i 1
for 1
one 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
pleasant 1
confidence 1
and 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
trip 1
here 1
were 1
my 1
five 1
familiar 1
companions 1
all 1
good 1
natured 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
seeming 1
to 1
have 1
no 1
worse 1
feeling 1
than 1
a 1
mild 1
triumph 1
as 1
of 1
winning 1
some 1
simple 1
game 1
and 1
even 1
that 1
they 1
politely 1
suppressed 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
opportunity 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
country 1
too 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
saw 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
better 1
i 1
liked 1
it 1
we 1
went 1
too 1
swiftly 1
for 1
close 1
observation 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
appreciate 1
perfect 1
roads 1
as 1
dustless 1
as 1
a 1
swept 1
floor 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
endless 1
lines 1
of 1
trees 1
the 1
ribbon 1
of 1
flowers 1
that 1
unrolled 1
beneath 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
rich 1
comfortable 1
country 1
that 1
stretched 1
off 1
and 1
away 1
full 1
of 1
varied 1
charm 1
we 1
rolled 1
through 1
many 1
villages 1
and 1
towns 1
and 1
i 1
soon 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
parklike 1
beauty 1
of 1
our 1
first 1
seen 1
city 1
was 1
no 1
exception 1
our 1
swift 1
high 1
sweeping 1
view 1
from 1
the 1
plane 1
had 1
been 1
most 1
attractive 1
but 1
lacked 1
detail 1
and 1
in 1
that 1
first 1
day 1
of 1
struggle 1
and 1
capture 1
we 1
noticed 1
little 1
but 1
now 1
we 1
were 1
swept 1
along 1
at 1
an 1
easy 1
rate 1
of 1
some 1
thirty 1
miles 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
covered 1
quite 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
ground 1
we 1
stopped 1
for 1
lunch 1
in 1
quite 1
a 1
sizable 1
town 1
and 1
here 1
rolling 1
slowly 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
we 1
saw 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
population 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
out 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
us 1
everywhere 1
we 1
had 1
passed 1
but 1
here 1
were 1
more 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
went 1
in 1
to 1
eat 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
garden 1
place 1
with 1
little 1
shaded 1
tables 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
flowers 1
many 1
eyes 1
were 1
upon 1
us 1
and 1
everywhere 1
open 1
country 1
village 1
or 1
city 1
only 1
women 1
old 1
women 1
and 1
young 1
women 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
majority 1
who 1
seemed 1
neither 1
young 1
nor 1
old 1
but 1
just 1
women 1
young 1
girls 1
also 1
though 1
these 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
seeming 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
groups 1
by 1
themselves 1
generally 1
were 1
less 1
in 1
evidence 1
we 1
caught 1
many 1
glimpses 1
of 1
girls 1
and 1
children 1
in 1
what 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
schools 1
or 1
in 1
playgrounds 1
and 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
judge 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
boys 1
we 1
all 1
looked 1
carefully 1
everyone 1
gazed 1
at 1
us 1
politely 1
kindly 1
and 1
with 1
eager 1
interest 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
impertinent 1
we 1
could 1
catch 1
quite 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
the 1
talk 1
now 1
and 1
all 1
they 1
said 1
seemed 1
pleasant 1
enough 1
well 1
before 1
nightfall 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
safely 1
back 1
in 1
our 1
big 1
room 1
the 1
damage 1
we 1
had 1
done 1
was 1
quite 1
ignored 1
the 1
beds 1
as 1
smooth 1
and 1
comfortable 1
as 1
before 1
new 1
clothing 1
and 1
towels 1
supplied 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
those 1
women 1
did 1
was 1
to 1
illuminate 1
the 1
gardens 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
to 1
set 1
an 1
extra 1
watch 1
but 1
they 1
called 1
us 1
to 1
account 1
next 1
day 1
our 1
three 1
tutors 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
joined 1
in 1
the 1
recapturing 1
expedition 1
had 1
been 1
quite 1
busy 1
in 1
preparing 1
for 1
us 1
and 1
now 1
made 1
explanation 1
they 1
knew 1
well 1
we 1
would 1
make 1
for 1
our 1
machine 1
and 1
also 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
of 1
getting 1
down 1
alive 1
so 1
our 1
flight 1
had 1
troubled 1
no 1
one 1
all 1
they 1
did 1
was 1
to 1
call 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
to 1
keep 1
an 1
eye 1
on 1
our 1
movements 1
all 1
along 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
between 1
the 1
two 1
points 1
it 1
appeared 1
that 1
many 1
of 1
those 1
nights 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
seen 1
by 1
careful 1
ladies 1
sitting 1
snugly 1
in 1
big 1
trees 1
by 1
the 1
riverbed 1
or 1
up 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
terry 1
looked 1
immensely 1
disgusted 1
but 1
it 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
extremely 1
funny 1
here 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
risking 1
our 1
lives 1
hiding 1
and 1
prowling 1
like 1
outlaws 1
living 1
on 1
nuts 1
and 1
fruit 1
getting 1
wet 1
and 1
cold 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
dry 1
and 1
hot 1
by 1
day 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
while 1
these 1
estimable 1
women 1
had 1
just 1
been 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
now 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
explain 1
carefully 1
using 1
such 1
words 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
understand 1
it 1
appeared 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
considered 1
as 1
guests 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
sort 1
of 1
public 1
wards 1
our 1
first 1
violence 1
had 1
made 1
it 1
necessary 1
to 1
keep 1
us 1
safeguarded 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
we 1
learned 1
the 1
language 1
and 1
would 1
agree 1
to 1
do 1
no 1
harm 1
they 1
would 1
show 1
us 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
land 1
jeff 1
was 1
eager 1
to 1
reassure 1
them 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
tell 1
on 1
terry 1
but 1
he 1
made 1
it 1
clear 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
ashamed 1
of 1
himself 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
now 1
conform 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
language 1
we 1
all 1
fell 1
upon 1
it 1
with 1
redoubled 1
energy 1
they 1
brought 1
us 1
books 1
in 1
greater 1
numbers 1
and 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
study 1
them 1
seriously 1
pretty 1
punk 1
literature 1
terry 1
burst 1
forth 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
privacy 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
room 1
of 1
course 1
one 1
expects 1
to 1
begin 1
on 1
child 1
stories 1
but 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
something 1
more 1
interesting 1
now 1
can 1
t 1
expect 1
stirring 1
romance 1
and 1
wild 1
adventure 1
without 1
men 1
can 1
you 1
i 1
asked 1
nothing 1
irritated 1
terry 1
more 1
than 1
to 1
have 1
us 1
assume 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
men 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
books 1
they 1
gave 1
us 1
or 1
the 1
pictures 1
shut 1
up 1
he 1
growled 1
what 1
infernal 1
nonsense 1
you 1
talk 1
i 1
m 1
going 1
to 1
ask 1
em 1
outright 1
we 1
know 1
enough 1
now 1
in 1
truth 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
using 1
our 1
best 1
efforts 1
to 1
master 1
the 1
language 1
and 1
were 1
able 1
to 1
read 1
fluently 1
and 1
to 1
discuss 1
what 1
we 1
read 1
with 1
considerable 1
ease 1
that 1
afternoon 1
we 1
were 1
all 1
sitting 1
together 1
on 1
the 1
roof 1
we 1
three 1
and 1
the 1
tutors 1
gathered 1
about 1
a 1
table 1
no 1
guards 1
about 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
to 1
understand 1
some 1
time 1
earlier 1
that 1
if 1
we 1
would 1
agree 1
to 1
do 1
no 1
violence 1
they 1
would 1
withdraw 1
their 1
constant 1
attendance 1
and 1
we 1
promised 1
most 1
willingly 1
so 1
there 1
we 1
sat 1
at 1
ease 1
all 1
in 1
similar 1
dress 1
our 1
hair 1
by 1
now 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
theirs 1
only 1
our 1
beards 1
to 1
distinguish 1
us 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
those 1
beards 1
but 1
had 1
so 1
far 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
induce 1
them 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
any 1
cutting 1
instruments 1
ladies 1
terry 1
began 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
clear 1
sky 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
are 1
there 1
no 1
men 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
men 1
somel 1
answered 1
like 1
you 1
yes 1
men 1
terry 1
indicated 1
his 1
beard 1
and 1
threw 1
back 1
his 1
broad 1
shoulders 1
men 1
real 1
men 1
no 1
she 1
answered 1
quietly 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
men 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
there 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
a 1
man 1
among 1
us 1
for 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
her 1
look 1
was 1
clear 1
and 1
truthful 1
and 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
advance 1
this 1
astonishing 1
statement 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
astonishing 1
but 1
quite 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fact 1
but 1
the 1
people 1
the 1
children 1
he 1
protested 1
not 1
believing 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
but 1
not 1
wishing 1
to 1
say 1
so 1
oh 1
yes 1
she 1
smiled 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
wonder 1
you 1
are 1
puzzled 1
we 1
are 1
mothers 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
fathers 1
we 1
thought 1
you 1
would 1
ask 1
about 1
that 1
long 1
ago 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
her 1
look 1
was 1
as 1
frankly 1
kind 1
as 1
always 1
her 1
tone 1
quite 1
simple 1
terry 1
explained 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
felt 1
sufficiently 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
language 1
making 1
rather 1
a 1
mess 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
thought 1
but 1
jeff 1
was 1
franker 1
will 1
you 1
excuse 1
us 1
all 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
we 1
admit 1
that 1
we 1
find 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
believe 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
such 1
possibility 1
in 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
have 1
you 1
no 1
kind 1
of 1
life 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
asked 1
zava 1
why 1
yes 1
some 1
low 1
forms 1
of 1
course 1
how 1
low 1
or 1
how 1
high 1
rather 1
well 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
rather 1
high 1
forms 1
of 1
insect 1
life 1
in 1
which 1
it 1
occurs 1
parthenogenesis 1
we 1
call 1
it 1
that 1
means 1
virgin 1
birth 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
follow 1
him 1
birth 1
we 1
know 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
what 1
is 1
virgin 1
terry 1
looked 1
uncomfortable 1
but 1
jeff 1
met 1
the 1
question 1
quite 1
calmly 1
among 1
mating 1
animals 1
the 1
term 1
virgin 1
is 1
applied 1
to 1
the 1
female 1
who 1
has 1
not 1
mated 1
he 1
answered 1
oh 1
i 1
see 1
and 1
does 1
it 1
apply 1
to 1
the 1
male 1
also 1
or 1
is 1
there 1
a 1
different 1
term 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
passed 1
this 1
over 1
rather 1
hurriedly 1
saying 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
term 1
would 1
apply 1
but 1
was 1
seldom 1
used 1
no 1
she 1
said 1
but 1
one 1
cannot 1
mate 1
without 1
the 1
other 1
surely 1
is 1
not 1
each 1
then 1
virgin 1
before 1
mating 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
have 1
you 1
any 1
forms 1
of 1
life 1
in 1
which 1
there 1
is 1
birth 1
from 1
a 1
father 1
only 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
none 1
he 1
answered 1
and 1
i 1
inquired 1
seriously 1
you 1
ask 1
us 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
for 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
only 1
women 1
here 1
and 1
only 1
girl 1
babies 1
born 1
exactly 1
answered 1
somel 1
nodding 1
gravely 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
among 1
other 1
animals 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
fathers 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
mothers 1
and 1
we 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
fathers 1
that 1
you 1
come 1
from 1
a 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
of 1
both 1
kinds 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
waiting 1
you 1
see 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
speak 1
freely 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
teach 1
us 1
about 1
your 1
country 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
you 1
know 1
so 1
much 1
you 1
see 1
and 1
we 1
know 1
only 1
our 1
own 1
land 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
our 1
previous 1
studies 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
some 1
pains 1
to 1
tell 1
them 1
about 1
the 1
big 1
world 1
outside 1
to 1
draw 1
sketches 1
maps 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
globe 1
even 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
spherical 1
fruit 1
and 1
show 1
the 1
size 1
and 1
relation 1
of 1
the 1
countries 1
and 1
to 1
tell 1
of 1
the 1
numbers 1
of 1
their 1
people 1
all 1
this 1
had 1
been 1
scant 1
and 1
in 1
outline 1
but 1
they 1
quite 1
understood 1
i 1
find 1
i 1
succeed 1
very 1
poorly 1
in 1
conveying 1
the 1
impression 1
i 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
of 1
these 1
women 1
so 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
ignorant 1
they 1
were 1
deeply 1
wise 1
that 1
we 1
realized 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
for 1
clear 1
reasoning 1
for 1
real 1
brain 1
scope 1
and 1
power 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
no 1
1 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
things 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
evenest 1
tempers 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
patience 1
and 1
good 1
nature 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
most 1
impressive 1
about 1
them 1
all 1
was 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
irritability 1
so 1
far 1
we 1
had 1
only 1
this 1
group 1
to 1
study 1
but 1
afterward 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
a 1
common 1
trait 1
we 1
had 1
gradually 1
come 1
to 1
feel 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
friends 1
and 1
very 1
capable 1
ones 1
at 1
that 1
but 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
form 1
any 1
opinion 1
yet 1
of 1
the 1
general 1
level 1
of 1
these 1
women 1
we 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
teach 1
us 1
all 1
you 1
can 1
somel 1
went 1
on 1
her 1
firm 1
shapely 1
hands 1
clasped 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
before 1
her 1
her 1
clear 1
quiet 1
eyes 1
meeting 1
ours 1
frankly 1
and 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
teach 1
you 1
what 1
we 1
have 1
that 1
is 1
novel 1
and 1
useful 1
you 1
can 1
well 1
imagine 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
wonderful 1
event 1
to 1
us 1
to 1
have 1
men 1
among 1
us 1
after 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
and 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
about 1
your 1
women 1
what 1
she 1
said 1
about 1
our 1
importance 1
gave 1
instant 1
pleasure 1
to 1
terry 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
lifted 1
his 1
head 1
that 1
it 1
pleased 1
him 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
spoke 1
of 1
our 1
women 1
someway 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
queer 1
little 1
indescribable 1
feeling 1
not 1
like 1
any 1
feeling 1
i 1
ever 1
had 1
before 1
when 1
women 1
were 1
mentioned 1
will 1
you 1
tell 1
us 1
how 1
it 1
came 1
about 1
jeff 1
pursued 1
you 1
said 1
for 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
did 1
you 1
have 1
men 1
here 1
before 1
that 1
yes 1
answered 1
zava 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
quiet 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
our 1
full 1
history 1
to 1
read 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
alarmed 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
made 1
clear 1
and 1
short 1
it 1
took 1
us 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
to 1
learn 1
how 1
to 1
write 1
history 1
oh 1
how 1
i 1
should 1
love 1
to 1
read 1
yours 1
she 1
turned 1
with 1
flashing 1
eager 1
eyes 1
looking 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
wonderful 1
would 1
it 1
not 1
to 1
compare 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
the 1
differences 1
are 1
between 1
us 1
who 1
are 1
only 1
mothers 1
and 1
you 1
who 1
are 1
mothers 1
and 1
fathers 1
too 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
see 1
with 1
our 1
birds 1
that 1
the 1
father 1
is 1
as 1
useful 1
as 1
the 1
mother 1
almost 1
but 1
among 1
insects 1
we 1
find 1
him 1
of 1
less 1
importance 1
sometimes 1
very 1
little 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
so 1
with 1
you 1
oh 1
yes 1
birds 1
and 1
bugs 1
terry 1
said 1
but 1
not 1
among 1
animals 1
have 1
you 1
no 1
animals 1
we 1
have 1
cats 1
she 1
said 1
the 1
father 1
is 1
not 1
very 1
useful 1
have 1
you 1
no 1
cattle 1
sheep 1
horses 1
i 1
drew 1
some 1
rough 1
outlines 1
of 1
these 1
beasts 1
and 1
showed 1
them 1
to 1
her 1
we 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
old 1
days 1
these 1
said 1
somel 1
and 1
sketched 1
with 1
swift 1
sure 1
touches 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sheep 1
or 1
llama 1
and 1
these 1
dogs 1
of 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
kinds 1
that 1
that 1
pointing 1
to 1
my 1
absurd 1
but 1
recognizable 1
horse 1
what 1
became 1
of 1
them 1
asked 1
jeff 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
want 1
them 1
anymore 1
they 1
took 1
up 1
too 1
much 1
room 1
we 1
need 1
all 1
our 1
land 1
to 1
feed 1
our 1
people 1
it 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
little 1
country 1
you 1
know 1
whatever 1
do 1
you 1
do 1
without 1
milk 1
terry 1
demanded 1
incredulously 1
milk 1
we 1
have 1
milk 1
in 1
abundance 1
our 1
own 1
but 1
but 1
i 1
mean 1
for 1
cooking 1
for 1
grown 1
people 1
terry 1
blundered 1
while 1
they 1
looked 1
amazed 1
and 1
a 1
shade 1
displeased 1
jeff 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
rescue 1
we 1
keep 1
cattle 1
for 1
their 1
milk 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
for 1
their 1
meat 1
he 1
explained 1
cow 1
s 1
milk 1
is 1
a 1
staple 1
article 1
of 1
diet 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
milk 1
industry 1
to 1
collect 1
and 1
distribute 1
it 1
still 1
they 1
looked 1
puzzled 1
i 1
pointed 1
to 1
my 1
outline 1
of 1
a 1
cow 1
the 1
farmer 1
milks 1
the 1
cow 1
i 1
said 1
and 1
sketched 1
a 1
milk 1
pail 1
the 1
stool 1
and 1
in 1
pantomime 1
showed 1
the 1
man 1
milking 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
carried 1
to 1
the 1
city 1
and 1
distributed 1
by 1
milkmen 1
everybody 1
has 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
has 1
the 1
cow 1
no 1
child 1
asked 1
somel 1
earnestly 1
oh 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
a 1
calf 1
that 1
is 1
is 1
there 1
milk 1
for 1
the 1
calf 1
and 1
you 1
too 1
it 1
took 1
some 1
time 1
to 1
make 1
clear 1
to 1
those 1
three 1
sweet 1
faced 1
women 1
the 1
process 1
which 1
robs 1
the 1
cow 1
of 1
her 1
calf 1
and 1
the 1
calf 1
of 1
its 1
true 1
food 1
and 1
the 1
talk 1
led 1
us 1
into 1
a 1
further 1
discussion 1
of 1
the 1
meat 1
business 1
they 1
heard 1
it 1
out 1
looking 1
very 1
white 1
and 1
presently 1
begged 1
to 1
be 1
excused 1
chapter 1
5 1
a 1
unique 1
history 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
piece 1
out 1
this 1
account 1
with 1
adventures 1
if 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
read 1
it 1
are 1
not 1
interested 1
in 1
these 1
amazing 1
women 1
and 1
their 1
history 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
interested 1
at 1
all 1
as 1
for 1
us 1
three 1
young 1
men 1
to 1
a 1
whole 1
landful 1
of 1
women 1
what 1
could 1
we 1
do 1
we 1
did 1
get 1
away 1
as 1
described 1
and 1
were 1
peacefully 1
brought 1
back 1
again 1
without 1
as 1
terry 1
complained 1
even 1
the 1
satisfaction 1
of 1
hitting 1
anybody 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
adventures 1
because 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
fight 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
wild 1
beasts 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
very 1
few 1
tame 1
ones 1
of 1
these 1
i 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
stop 1
to 1
describe 1
the 1
one 1
common 1
pet 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
cats 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
such 1
cats 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
suppose 1
these 1
lady 1
burbanks 1
had 1
done 1
with 1
their 1
cats 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
prolonged 1
and 1
careful 1
selection 1
and 1
exclusion 1
they 1
had 1
developed 1
a 1
race 1
of 1
cats 1
that 1
did 1
not 1
sing 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
fact 1
the 1
most 1
those 1
poor 1
dumb 1
brutes 1
could 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
squeak 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
hungry 1
or 1
wanted 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
to 1
purr 1
and 1
make 1
the 1
various 1
mother 1
noises 1
to 1
their 1
kittens 1
moreover 1
they 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
kill 1
birds 1
they 1
were 1
rigorously 1
bred 1
to 1
destroy 1
mice 1
and 1
moles 1
and 1
all 1
such 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
food 1
supply 1
but 1
the 1
birds 1
were 1
numerous 1
and 1
safe 1
while 1
we 1
were 1
discussing 1
birds 1
terry 1
asked 1
them 1
if 1
they 1
used 1
feathers 1
for 1
their 1
hats 1
and 1
they 1
seemed 1
amused 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
few 1
sketches 1
of 1
our 1
women 1
s 1
hats 1
with 1
plumes 1
and 1
quills 1
and 1
those 1
various 1
tickling 1
things 1
that 1
stick 1
out 1
so 1
far 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
eagerly 1
interested 1
as 1
at 1
everything 1
about 1
our 1
women 1
as 1
for 1
them 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
only 1
wore 1
hats 1
for 1
shade 1
when 1
working 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
those 1
were 1
big 1
light 1
straw 1
hats 1
something 1
like 1
those 1
used 1
in 1
china 1
and 1
japan 1
in 1
cold 1
weather 1
they 1
wore 1
caps 1
or 1
hoods 1
but 1
for 1
decorative 1
purposes 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
think 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
becoming 1
pursued 1
terry 1
making 1
as 1
pretty 1
a 1
picture 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
of 1
a 1
lady 1
with 1
a 1
plumed 1
hat 1
they 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
agreed 1
to 1
that 1
asking 1
quite 1
simply 1
if 1
the 1
men 1
wore 1
the 1
same 1
kind 1
we 1
hastened 1
to 1
assure 1
her 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
drew 1
for 1
them 1
our 1
kind 1
of 1
headgear 1
and 1
do 1
no 1
men 1
wear 1
feathers 1
in 1
their 1
hats 1
only 1
indians 1
jeff 1
explained 1
savages 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
he 1
sketched 1
a 1
war 1
bonnet 1
to 1
show 1
them 1
and 1
soldiers 1
i 1
added 1
drawing 1
a 1
military 1
hat 1
with 1
plumes 1
they 1
never 1
expressed 1
horror 1
or 1
disapproval 1
nor 1
indeed 1
much 1
surprise 1
just 1
a 1
keen 1
interest 1
and 1
the 1
notes 1
they 1
made 1
miles 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
our 1
pussycats 1
we 1
were 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
impressed 1
by 1
this 1
achievement 1
in 1
breeding 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
questioned 1
us 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
we 1
were 1
well 1
pumped 1
for 1
information 1
we 1
told 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
done 1
for 1
dogs 1
and 1
horses 1
and 1
cattle 1
but 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
effort 1
applied 1
to 1
cats 1
except 1
for 1
show 1
purposes 1
i 1
wish 1
i 1
could 1
represent 1
the 1
kind 1
quiet 1
steady 1
ingenious 1
way 1
they 1
questioned 1
us 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
just 1
curiosity 1
they 1
weren 1
t 1
a 1
bit 1
more 1
curious 1
about 1
us 1
than 1
we 1
were 1
about 1
them 1
if 1
as 1
much 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
bent 1
on 1
understanding 1
our 1
kind 1
of 1
civilization 1
and 1
their 1
lines 1
of 1
interrogation 1
would 1
gradually 1
surround 1
us 1
and 1
drive 1
us 1
in 1
till 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
up 1
against 1
some 1
admissions 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
are 1
all 1
these 1
breeds 1
of 1
dogs 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
useful 1
they 1
asked 1
oh 1
useful 1
why 1
the 1
hunting 1
dogs 1
and 1
watchdogs 1
and 1
sheepdogs 1
are 1
useful 1
and 1
sleddogs 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
ratters 1
i 1
suppose 1
but 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
keep 1
dogs 1
for 1
their 1
usefulness 1
the 1
dog 1
is 1
the 1
friend 1
of 1
man 1
we 1
say 1
we 1
love 1
them 1
that 1
they 1
understood 1
we 1
love 1
our 1
cats 1
that 1
way 1
they 1
surely 1
are 1
our 1
friends 1
and 1
helpers 1
too 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
how 1
intelligent 1
and 1
affectionate 1
they 1
are 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fact 1
i 1
d 1
never 1
seen 1
such 1
cats 1
except 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
rare 1
instances 1
big 1
handsome 1
silky 1
things 1
friendly 1
with 1
everyone 1
and 1
devotedly 1
attached 1
to 1
their 1
special 1
owners 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
heartbreaking 1
time 1
drowning 1
kittens 1
we 1
suggested 1
but 1
they 1
said 1
oh 1
no 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
care 1
for 1
them 1
as 1
you 1
do 1
for 1
your 1
valuable 1
cattle 1
the 1
fathers 1
are 1
few 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
mothers 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
very 1
fine 1
ones 1
in 1
each 1
town 1
they 1
live 1
quite 1
happily 1
in 1
walled 1
gardens 1
and 1
the 1
houses 1
of 1
their 1
friends 1
but 1
they 1
only 1
have 1
a 1
mating 1
season 1
once 1
a 1
year 1
rather 1
hard 1
on 1
thomas 1
isn 1
t 1
it 1
suggested 1
terry 1
oh 1
no 1
truly 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
is 1
many 1
centuries 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
breeding 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
cats 1
we 1
wanted 1
they 1
are 1
healthy 1
and 1
happy 1
and 1
friendly 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
manage 1
with 1
your 1
dogs 1
do 1
you 1
keep 1
them 1
in 1
pairs 1
or 1
segregate 1
the 1
fathers 1
or 1
what 1
then 1
we 1
explained 1
that 1
well 1
that 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
fathers 1
exactly 1
that 1
nobody 1
wanted 1
a 1
a 1
mother 1
dog 1
that 1
well 1
that 1
practically 1
all 1
our 1
dogs 1
were 1
males 1
there 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
very 1
small 1
percentage 1
of 1
females 1
allowed 1
to 1
live 1
then 1
zava 1
observing 1
terry 1
with 1
her 1
grave 1
sweet 1
smile 1
quoted 1
back 1
at 1
him 1
rather 1
hard 1
on 1
thomas 1
isn 1
t 1
it 1
do 1
they 1
enjoy 1
it 1
living 1
without 1
mates 1
are 1
your 1
dogs 1
as 1
uniformly 1
healthy 1
and 1
sweet 1
tempered 1
as 1
our 1
cats 1
jeff 1
laughed 1
eyeing 1
terry 1
mischievously 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fact 1
we 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
jeff 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
traitor 1
he 1
so 1
often 1
flopped 1
over 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
side 1
of 1
things 1
also 1
his 1
medical 1
knowledge 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
different 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
somehow 1
i 1
m 1
sorry 1
to 1
admit 1
he 1
told 1
them 1
that 1
the 1
dog 1
with 1
us 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
diseased 1
of 1
any 1
animal 1
next 1
to 1
man 1
and 1
as 1
to 1
temper 1
there 1
are 1
always 1
some 1
dogs 1
who 1
bite 1
people 1
especially 1
children 1

our 1
interlocutors 1
sat 1
up 1
straight 1
at 1
once 1
they 1
were 1
still 1
gentle 1
still 1
restrained 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
deep 1
amazement 1
in 1
their 1
voices 1
do 1
we 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
keep 1
an 1
animal 1

unmated 1
male 1
animal 1

in 1
at 1
this 1
you 1

not 1
imagine 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
dangerous 1

s 1
not 1
one 1
in 1
a 1
hundred 1
that 1
ever 1
bites 1
anybody 1
why 1
they 1

somel 1
oh 1
girls 1
why 1
they 1
like 1
them 1
too 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
his 1
voice 1
flatted 1
a 1
little 1
they 1
always 1
noticed 1
little 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
we 1
found 1
later 1
little 1
by 1
little 1
they 1
wrung 1
from 1
us 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
friend 1
of 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
city 1
was 1
a 1
prisoner 1
was 1
taken 1
out 1
for 1
his 1
meager 1
exercise 1
on 1
a 1
leash 1
was 1
liable 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
many 1
diseases 1
but 1
to 1
the 1
one 1
destroying 1
horror 1
of 1
rabies 1
and 1
in 1
many 1
cases 1
for 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
the 1
citizens 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
muzzled 1
jeff 1
maliciously 1
added 1
vivid 1
instances 1
he 1
had 1
known 1
or 1
read 1
of 1
injury 1
and 1
death 1
from 1
mad 1
dogs 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
scold 1
or 1
fuss 1
about 1
it 1
calm 1
as 1
judges 1
those 1
women 1
were 1
but 1
they 1
made 1
notes 1
moadine 1
read 1
them 1
to 1
us 1
please 1
tell 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
the 1
facts 1
correct 1
she 1
said 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
and 1
in 1
others 1
too 1
yes 1
we 1
admitted 1
in 1
most 1
civilized 1
countries 1
in 1
most 1
civilized 1
countries 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
animal 1
is 1
kept 1
which 1
is 1
no 1
longer 1
useful 1
they 1
are 1
a 1
protection 1
terry 1
insisted 1
they 1
bark 1
if 1
burglars 1
try 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
then 1
she 1
made 1
notes 1
of 1
burglars 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
love 1
which 1
people 1
bear 1
to 1
this 1
animal 1
zava 1
interrupted 1
here 1
is 1
it 1
the 1
men 1
or 1
the 1
women 1
who 1
love 1
this 1
animal 1
so 1
much 1
both 1
insisted 1
terry 1
equally 1
she 1
inquired 1
and 1
jeff 1
said 1
nonsense 1
terry 1
you 1
know 1
men 1
like 1
dogs 1
better 1
than 1
women 1
do 1
as 1
a 1
whole 1
because 1
they 1
love 1
it 1
so 1
much 1
especially 1
men 1
this 1
animal 1
is 1
kept 1
shut 1
up 1
or 1
chained 1
why 1
suddenly 1
asked 1
somel 1
we 1
keep 1
our 1
father 1
cats 1
shut 1
up 1
because 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
want 1
too 1
much 1
fathering 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
chained 1
they 1
have 1
large 1
grounds 1
to 1
run 1
in 1
a 1
valuable 1
dog 1
would 1
be 1
stolen 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
let 1
loose 1
i 1
said 1
we 1
put 1
collars 1
on 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
owner 1
s 1
name 1
in 1
case 1
they 1
do 1
stray 1
besides 1
they 1
get 1
into 1
fights 1
a 1
valuable 1
dog 1
might 1
easily 1
be 1
killed 1
by 1
a 1
bigger 1
one 1
i 1
see 1
she 1
said 1
they 1
fight 1
when 1
they 1
meet 1
is 1
that 1
common 1
we 1
admitted 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
they 1
are 1
kept 1
shut 1
up 1
or 1
chained 1
she 1
paused 1
again 1
and 1
asked 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
dog 1
fond 1
of 1
running 1
are 1
they 1
not 1
built 1
for 1
speed 1
that 1
we 1
admitted 1
too 1
and 1
jeff 1
still 1
malicious 1
enlightened 1
them 1
further 1
i 1
ve 1
always 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
pathetic 1
sight 1
both 1
ways 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
man 1
or 1
a 1
woman 1
taking 1
a 1
dog 1
to 1
walk 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
string 1
have 1
you 1
bred 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
neat 1
in 1
their 1
habits 1
as 1
cats 1
are 1
was 1
the 1
next 1
question 1
and 1
when 1
jeff 1
told 1
them 1
of 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
dogs 1
on 1
sidewalk 1
merchandise 1
and 1
the 1
streets 1
generally 1
they 1
found 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
believe 1
you 1
see 1
their 1
country 1
was 1
as 1
neat 1
as 1
a 1
dutch 1
kitchen 1
and 1
as 1
to 1
sanitation 1
but 1
i 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
start 1
in 1
now 1
with 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
remember 1
of 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
this 1
amazing 1
country 1
before 1
further 1
description 1
and 1
i 1
ll 1
summarize 1
here 1
a 1
bit 1
as 1
to 1
our 1
opportunities 1
for 1
learning 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
try 1
to 1
repeat 1
the 1
careful 1
detailed 1
account 1
i 1
lost 1
i 1
ll 1
just 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
kept 1
in 1
that 1
fortress 1
a 1
good 1
six 1
months 1
all 1
told 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
three 1
in 1
a 1
pleasant 1
enough 1
city 1
where 1
to 1
terry 1
s 1
infinite 1
disgust 1
there 1
were 1
only 1
colonels 1
and 1
little 1
children 1
no 1
young 1
women 1
whatever 1
then 1
we 1
were 1
under 1
surveillance 1
for 1
three 1
more 1
always 1
with 1
a 1
tutor 1
or 1
a 1
guard 1
or 1
both 1
but 1
those 1
months 1
were 1
pleasant 1
because 1
we 1
were 1
really 1
getting 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
girls 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
chapter 1
or 1
will 1
be 1
i 1
will 1
try 1
to 1
do 1
justice 1
to 1
it 1
we 1
learned 1
their 1
language 1
pretty 1
thoroughly 1
had 1
to 1
and 1
they 1
learned 1
ours 1
much 1
more 1
quickly 1
and 1
used 1
it 1
to 1
hasten 1
our 1
own 1
studies 1
jeff 1
who 1
was 1
never 1
without 1
reading 1
matter 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
had 1
two 1
little 1
books 1
with 1
him 1
a 1
novel 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
anthology 1
of 1
verse 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
pocket 1
encyclopedias 1
a 1
fat 1
little 1
thing 1
bursting 1
with 1
facts 1
these 1
were 1
used 1
in 1
our 1
education 1
and 1
theirs 1
then 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
they 1
furnished 1
us 1
with 1
plenty 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
books 1
and 1
i 1
went 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
history 1
part 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
genesis 1
of 1
this 1
miracle 1
of 1
theirs 1
and 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
happened 1
according 1
to 1
their 1
records 1
as 1
to 1
geography 1
at 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
christian 1
era 1
this 1
land 1
had 1
a 1
free 1
passage 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
i 1
m 1
not 1
saying 1
where 1
for 1
good 1
reasons 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
fairly 1
easy 1
pass 1
through 1
that 1
wall 1
of 1
mountains 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
these 1
people 1
were 1
of 1
aryan 1
stock 1
and 1
were 1
once 1
in 1
contact 1
with 1
the 1
best 1
civilization 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
world 1
they 1
were 1
white 1
but 1
somewhat 1
darker 1
than 1
our 1
northern 1
races 1
because 1
of 1
their 1
constant 1
exposure 1
to 1
sun 1
and 1
air 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
far 1
larger 1
then 1
including 1
much 1
land 1
beyond 1
the 1
pass 1
and 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
coast 1
they 1
had 1
ships 1
commerce 1
an 1
army 1
a 1
king 1
for 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
they 1
were 1
what 1
they 1
so 1
calmly 1
called 1
us 1
a 1
bi 1
sexual 1
race 1
what 1
happened 1
to 1
them 1
first 1
was 1
merely 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
historic 1
misfortunes 1
such 1
as 1
have 1
befallen 1
other 1
nations 1
often 1
enough 1
they 1
were 1
decimated 1
by 1
war 1
driven 1
up 1
from 1
their 1
coastline 1
till 1
finally 1
the 1
reduced 1
population 1
with 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
killed 1
in 1
battle 1
occupied 1
this 1
hinterland 1
and 1
defended 1
it 1
for 1
years 1
in 1
the 1
mountain 1
passes 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
open 1
to 1
any 1
possible 1
attack 1
from 1
below 1
they 1
strengthened 1
the 1
natural 1
defenses 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
became 1
unscalably 1
secure 1
as 1
we 1
found 1
it 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
polygamous 1
people 1
and 1
a 1
slave 1
holding 1
people 1
like 1
all 1
of 1
their 1
time 1
and 1
during 1
the 1
generation 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
this 1
struggle 1
to 1
defend 1
their 1
mountain 1
home 1
they 1
built 1
the 1
fortresses 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
one 1
we 1
were 1
held 1
in 1
and 1
other 1
of 1
their 1
oldest 1
buildings 1
some 1
still 1
in 1
use 1
nothing 1
but 1
earthquakes 1
could 1
destroy 1
such 1
architecture 1
huge 1
solid 1
blocks 1
holding 1
by 1
their 1
own 1
weight 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
had 1
efficient 1
workmen 1
and 1
enough 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
those 1
days 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
brave 1
fight 1
for 1
their 1
existence 1
but 1
no 1
nation 1
can 1
stand 1
up 1
against 1
what 1
the 1
steamship 1
companies 1
call 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
god 1
while 1
the 1
whole 1
fighting 1
force 1
was 1
doing 1
its 1
best 1
to 1
defend 1
their 1
mountain 1
pathway 1
there 1
occurred 1
a 1
volcanic 1
outburst 1
with 1
some 1
local 1
tremors 1
and 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
the 1
complete 1
filling 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
pass 1
their 1
only 1
outlet 1
instead 1
of 1
a 1
passage 1
a 1
new 1
ridge 1
sheer 1
and 1
high 1
stood 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
they 1
were 1
walled 1
in 1
and 1
beneath 1
that 1
wall 1
lay 1
their 1
whole 1
little 1
army 1
very 1
few 1
men 1
were 1
left 1
alive 1
save 1
the 1
slaves 1
and 1
these 1
now 1
seized 1
their 1
opportunity 1
rose 1
in 1
revolt 1
killed 1
their 1
remaining 1
masters 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
youngest 1
boy 1
killed 1
the 1
old 1
women 1
too 1
and 1
the 1
mothers 1
intending 1
to 1
take 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
with 1
the 1
remaining 1
young 1
women 1
and 1
girls 1
but 1
this 1
succession 1
of 1
misfortunes 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
those 1
infuriated 1
virgins 1
there 1
were 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
but 1
few 1
of 1
these 1
would 1
be 1
masters 1
so 1
the 1
young 1
women 1
instead 1
of 1
submitting 1
rose 1
in 1
sheer 1
desperation 1
and 1
slew 1
their 1
brutal 1
conquerors 1
this 1
sounds 1
like 1
titus 1
andronicus 1
i 1
know 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
their 1
account 1
i 1
suppose 1
they 1
were 1
about 1
crazy 1
can 1
you 1
blame 1
them 1
there 1
was 1
literally 1
no 1
one 1
left 1
on 1
this 1
beautiful 1
high 1
garden 1
land 1
but 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
hysterical 1
girls 1
and 1
some 1
older 1
slave 1
women 1
that 1
was 1
about 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
ago 1
at 1
first 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
period 1
of 1
sheer 1
despair 1
the 1
mountains 1
towered 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
their 1
old 1
enemies 1
but 1
also 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
escape 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
way 1
up 1
or 1
down 1
or 1
out 1
they 1
simply 1
had 1
to 1
stay 1
there 1
some 1
were 1
for 1
suicide 1
but 1
not 1
the 1
majority 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
plucky 1
lot 1
as 1
a 1
whole 1
and 1
they 1
decided 1
to 1
live 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
did 1
live 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
had 1
hope 1
as 1
youth 1
must 1
that 1
something 1
would 1
happen 1
to 1
change 1
their 1
fate 1
so 1
they 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
bury 1
the 1
dead 1
to 1
plow 1
and 1
sow 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
one 1
another 1
speaking 1
of 1
burying 1
the 1
dead 1
i 1
will 1
set 1
down 1
while 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
adopted 1
cremation 1
in 1
about 1
the 1
thirteenth 1
century 1
for 1
the 1
same 1
reason 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
left 1
off 1
raising 1
cattle 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
spare 1
the 1
room 1
they 1
were 1
much 1
surprised 1
to 1
learn 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
still 1
burying 1
asked 1
our 1
reasons 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
were 1
much 1
dissatisfied 1
with 1
what 1
we 1
gave 1
we 1
told 1
them 1
of 1
the 1
belief 1
in 1
the 1
resurrection 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
they 1
asked 1
if 1
our 1
god 1
was 1
not 1
as 1
well 1
able 1
to 1
resurrect 1
from 1
ashes 1
as 1
from 1
long 1
corruption 1
we 1
told 1
them 1
of 1
how 1
people 1
thought 1
it 1
repugnant 1
to 1
have 1
their 1
loved 1
ones 1
burn 1
and 1
they 1
asked 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
less 1
repugnant 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
decay 1
they 1
were 1
inconveniently 1
reasonable 1
those 1
women 1
well 1
that 1
original 1
bunch 1
of 1
girls 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
make 1
their 1
living 1
as 1
best 1
they 1
could 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
remaining 1
slave 1
women 1
rendered 1
invaluable 1
service 1
teaching 1
such 1
trades 1
as 1
they 1
knew 1
they 1
had 1
such 1
records 1
as 1
were 1
then 1
kept 1
all 1
the 1
tools 1
and 1
implements 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
a 1
most 1
fertile 1
land 1
to 1
work 1
in 1
there 1
were 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
the 1
younger 1
matrons 1
who 1
had 1
escaped 1
slaughter 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
babies 1
were 1
born 1
after 1
the 1
cataclysm 1
but 1
only 1
two 1
boys 1
and 1
they 1
both 1
died 1
for 1
five 1
or 1
ten 1
years 1
they 1
worked 1
together 1
growing 1
stronger 1
and 1
wiser 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
mutually 1
attached 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
miracle 1
happened 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
young 1
women 1
bore 1
a 1
child 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
all 1
thought 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
somewhere 1
but 1
none 1
was 1
found 1
then 1
they 1
decided 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
direct 1
gift 1
from 1
the 1
gods 1
and 1
placed 1
the 1
proud 1
mother 1
in 1
the 1
temple 1
of 1
maaia 1
their 1
goddess 1
of 1
motherhood 1
under 1
strict 1
watch 1
and 1
there 1
as 1
years 1
passed 1
this 1
wonder 1
woman 1
bore 1
child 1
after 1
child 1
five 1
of 1
them 1
all 1
girls 1
i 1
did 1
my 1
best 1
keenly 1
interested 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
been 1
in 1
sociology 1
and 1
social 1
psychology 1
to 1
reconstruct 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
the 1
real 1
position 1
of 1
these 1
ancient 1
women 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
hundred 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
harem 1
bred 1
yet 1
for 1
the 1
few 1
preceding 1
generations 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
reared 1
in 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
of 1
such 1
heroic 1
struggle 1
that 1
the 1
stock 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
toughened 1
somewhat 1
left 1
alone 1
in 1
that 1
terrific 1
orphanhood 1
they 1
had 1
clung 1
together 1
supporting 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
their 1
little 1
sisters 1
and 1
developing 1
unknown 1
powers 1
in 1
the 1
stress 1
of 1
new 1
necessity 1
to 1
this 1
pain 1
hardened 1
and 1
work 1
strengthened 1
group 1
who 1
had 1
lost 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
care 1
of 1
parents 1
but 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
ever 1
having 1
children 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
there 1
now 1
dawned 1
the 1
new 1
hope 1
here 1
at 1
last 1
was 1
motherhood 1
and 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
personally 1
it 1
might 1
if 1
the 1
power 1
was 1
inherited 1
found 1
here 1
a 1
new 1
race 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
imagined 1
how 1
those 1
five 1
daughters 1
of 1
maaia 1
children 1
of 1
the 1
temple 1
mothers 1
of 1
the 1
future 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
the 1
titles 1
that 1
love 1
and 1
hope 1
and 1
reverence 1
could 1
give 1
were 1
reared 1
the 1
whole 1
little 1
nation 1
of 1
women 1
surrounded 1
them 1
with 1
loving 1
service 1
and 1
waited 1
between 1
a 1
boundless 1
hope 1
and 1
an 1
equally 1
boundless 1
despair 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
they 1
too 1
would 1
be 1
mothers 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
twenty 1
five 1
they 1
began 1
bearing 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
like 1
her 1
mother 1
bore 1
five 1
daughters 1
presently 1
there 1
were 1
twenty 1
five 1
new 1
women 1
mothers 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
right 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
changed 1
from 1
mourning 1
and 1
mere 1
courageous 1
resignation 1
to 1
proud 1
joy 1
the 1
older 1
women 1
those 1
who 1
remembered 1
men 1
died 1
off 1
the 1
youngest 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
first 1
lot 1
of 1
course 1
died 1
too 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
there 1
were 1
left 1
one 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
five 1
parthenogenetic 1
women 1
founding 1
a 1
new 1
race 1
they 1
inherited 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
devoted 1
care 1
of 1
that 1
declining 1
band 1
of 1
original 1
ones 1
could 1
leave 1
them 1
their 1
little 1
country 1
was 1
quite 1
safe 1
their 1
farms 1
and 1
gardens 1
were 1
all 1
in 1
full 1
production 1
such 1
industries 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
were 1
in 1
careful 1
order 1
the 1
records 1
of 1
their 1
past 1
were 1
all 1
preserved 1
and 1
for 1
years 1
the 1
older 1
women 1
had 1
spent 1
their 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
teaching 1
they 1
were 1
capable 1
of 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
leave 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
group 1
of 1
sisters 1
and 1
mothers 1
all 1
they 1
possessed 1
of 1
skill 1
and 1
knowledge 1

the 1

of 1
herland 1

descended 1
from 1

granddaughters 1

as 1
queen 1
priestess 1
mother 1
of 1
them 1
all 1
and 1
died 1
with 1
a 1
nobler 1
pride 1
and 1
a 1
fuller 1
joy 1
than 1
perhaps 1
any 1
human 1
soul 1
has 1
ever 1
known 1

founded 1
a 1
new 1
race 1
the 1
first 1

grown 1
up 1
in 1
an 1
atmosphere 1
of 1
holy 1
calm 1
of 1
awed 1
watchful 1
waiting 1
of 1
breathless 1
prayer 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
longed 1
for 1
motherhood 1
was 1
not 1
only 1
a 1
personal 1
joy 1
but 1
a 1
nation 1

their 1
twenty 1
five 1
daughters 1
in 1
turn 1
with 1
a 1
stronger 1
hope 1

richer 1
wider 1
outlook 1
with 1
the 1
devoted 1
love 1
and 1
care 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
surviving 1
population 1
grew 1
up 1
as 1
a 1
holy 1
sisterhood 1
their 1
whole 1
ardent 1
youth 1
looking 1
forward 1
to 1
their 1
great 1
office 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
were 1
left 1
alone 1
the 1
white 1
haired 1
first 1
mother 1
was 1
gone 1
and 1
this 1
one 1
family 1
five 1
sisters 1
twenty 1
five 1
first 1
cousins 1
and 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
twenty 1
five 1
second 1
cousins 1
began 1
a 1
new 1
race 1
here 1
you 1
have 1
human 1
beings 1
unquestionably 1
but 1
what 1
we 1
were 1
slow 1
in 1
understanding 1
was 1
how 1
these 1
ultra 1
women 1
inheriting 1
only 1
from 1
women 1
had 1
eliminated 1
not 1
only 1
certain 1
masculine 1
characteristics 1
which 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
look 1
for 1
but 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
had 1
always 1
thought 1
essentially 1
feminine 1
the 1
tradition 1
of 1
men 1
as 1
guardians 1
and 1
protectors 1
had 1
quite 1
died 1
out 1
these 1
stalwart 1
virgins 1
had 1
no 1
men 1
to 1
fear 1
and 1
therefore 1
no 1
need 1
of 1
protection 1
as 1
to 1
wild 1
beasts 1
there 1
were 1
none 1
in 1
their 1
sheltered 1
land 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
mother 1
love 1
that 1
maternal 1
instinct 1
we 1
so 1
highly 1
laud 1
was 1
theirs 1
of 1
course 1
raised 1
to 1
its 1
highest 1
power 1
and 1
a 1
sister 1
love 1
which 1
even 1
while 1
recognizing 1
the 1
actual 1
relationship 1
we 1
found 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
credit 1
terry 1
incredulous 1
even 1
contemptuous 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
alone 1
refused 1
to 1
believe 1
the 1
story 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
traditions 1
as 1
old 1
as 1
herodotus 1
and 1
about 1

trustworthy 1

said 1
it 1
s 1
likely 1
women 1
just 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
women 1
would 1
have 1
hung 1
together 1
like 1
that 1
we 1
all 1
know 1
women 1
can 1
t 1
organize 1
that 1
they 1
scrap 1
like 1
anything 1
are 1
frightfully 1
jealous 1
but 1
these 1
new 1
ladies 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
anyone 1
to 1
be 1
jealous 1
of 1
remember 1
drawled 1
jeff 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
likely 1
story 1
terry 1
sneered 1
why 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
invent 1
a 1
likelier 1
one 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
here 1
are 1
the 1
women 1
nothing 1
but 1
women 1
and 1
you 1
yourself 1
admit 1
there 1
s 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
this 1
was 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
about 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
i 1
ll 1

just 1
men 1
together 1
what 1
a 1
man 1
wants 1
of 1
women 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
this 1
motherhood 1
we 1
were 1
as 1
patient 1
as 1
possible 1
with 1
terry 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
about 1
nine 1
months 1
among 1
the 1
colonels 1
when 1
he 1
made 1
that 1
outburst 1
and 1
with 1
no 1
chance 1
at 1
any 1
more 1
strenuous 1
excitement 1
than 1
our 1
gymnastics 1
gave 1
us 1
save 1
for 1
our 1
escape 1
fiasco 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
suppose 1
terry 1
had 1
ever 1
lived 1
so 1
long 1
with 1
neither 1
love 1
combat 1
nor 1
danger 1
to 1
employ 1
his 1
superabundant 1
energies 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
irritable 1
neither 1
jeff 1
nor 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
so 1
wearing 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
much 1
interested 1
intellectually 1
that 1
our 1
confinement 1
did 1
not 1
wear 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
jeff 1
bless 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
that 1
tutor 1
of 1
his 1
almost 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
girl 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
but 1
more 1
as 1
to 1
terry 1
s 1
criticism 1
it 1
was 1
true 1
these 1
women 1
whose 1
essential 1
distinction 1
of 1
motherhood 1
was 1
the 1
dominant 1
note 1
of 1
their 1
whole 1
culture 1
were 1
strikingly 1
deficient 1
in 1
what 1
we 1
call 1
femininity 1
this 1
led 1
me 1
very 1
promptly 1
to 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
those 1
feminine 1
charms 1
we 1
are 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
are 1
not 1
feminine 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
mere 1
reflected 1
masculinity 1
developed 1
to 1
please 1
us 1
because 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
please 1
us 1
and 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
essential 1
to 1
the 1
real 1
fulfillment 1
of 1
their 1
great 1
process 1
but 1
terry 1
came 1
to 1
no 1
such 1
conclusion 1
just 1
you 1
wait 1
till 1
i 1
get 1
out 1
he 1
muttered 1
then 1
we 1
both 1
cautioned 1
him 1
look 1
here 1
terry 1
my 1
boy 1
you 1
be 1
careful 1
they 1
ve 1
been 1
mighty 1
good 1
to 1
us 1
but 1
do 1
you 1
remember 1
the 1
anesthesia 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
any 1
mischief 1
in 1
this 1
virgin 1
land 1
beware 1
of 1
the 1
vengeance 1
of 1
the 1
maiden 1
aunts 1
come 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
forever 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
history 1
they 1
began 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
plan 1
and 1
built 1
for 1
their 1
children 1
all 1
the 1
strength 1
and 1
intelligence 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
them 1
devoted 1
to 1
that 1
one 1
thing 1
each 1
girl 1
of 1
course 1
was 1
reared 1
in 1
full 1
knowledge 1
of 1
her 1
crowning 1
office 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
even 1
then 1
very 1
high 1
ideas 1
of 1
the 1
molding 1
powers 1
of 1
the 1
mother 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
those 1
of 1
education 1
such 1
high 1
ideals 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
beauty 1
health 1
strength 1
intellect 1
goodness 1
for 1
those 1
they 1
prayed 1
and 1
worked 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
enemies 1
they 1
themselves 1
were 1
all 1
sisters 1
and 1
friends 1
the 1
land 1
was 1
fair 1
before 1
them 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
future 1
began 1
to 1
form 1
itself 1
in 1
their 1
minds 1
the 1
religion 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
begin 1
with 1
was 1
much 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
old 1
greece 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
gods 1
and 1
goddesses 1
but 1
they 1
lost 1
all 1
interest 1
in 1
deities 1
of 1
war 1
and 1
plunder 1
and 1
gradually 1
centered 1
on 1
their 1
mother 1
goddess 1
altogether 1
then 1
as 1
they 1
grew 1
more 1
intelligent 1
this 1
had 1
turned 1
into 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
maternal 1
pantheism 1
here 1
was 1
mother 1
earth 1
bearing 1
fruit 1
all 1
that 1
they 1
ate 1
was 1
fruit 1
of 1
motherhood 1
from 1
seed 1
or 1
egg 1
or 1
their 1
product 1
by 1
motherhood 1
they 1
were 1
born 1
and 1
by 1
motherhood 1
they 1
lived 1
life 1
was 1
to 1
them 1
just 1
the 1
long 1
cycle 1
of 1
motherhood 1
but 1
very 1
early 1
they 1
recognized 1
the 1
need 1
of 1
improvement 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
of 1
mere 1
repetition 1
and 1
devoted 1
their 1
combined 1
intelligence 1
to 1
that 1
problem 1
how 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
best 1
kind 1
of 1
people 1
first 1
this 1
was 1
merely 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
bearing 1
better 1
ones 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
recognized 1
that 1
however 1
the 1
children 1
differed 1
at 1
birth 1
the 1
real 1
growth 1
lay 1
later 1
through 1
education 1
then 1
things 1
began 1
to 1
hum 1
as 1
i 1
learned 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
to 1
appreciate 1
what 1
these 1
women 1
had 1
accomplished 1
the 1
less 1
proud 1
i 1
was 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
with 1
all 1
our 1
manhood 1
had 1
done 1
you 1
see 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
no 1
wars 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
no 1
kings 1
and 1
no 1
priests 1
and 1
no 1
aristocracies 1
they 1
were 1
sisters 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
grew 1
they 1
grew 1
together 1
not 1
by 1
competition 1
but 1
by 1
united 1
action 1
we 1
tried 1
to 1
put 1
in 1
a 1
good 1
word 1
for 1
competition 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
keenly 1
interested 1
indeed 1
we 1
soon 1
found 1
from 1
their 1
earnest 1
questions 1
of 1
us 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
prepared 1
to 1
believe 1
our 1
world 1
must 1
be 1
better 1
than 1
theirs 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
sure 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
such 1
arrogance 1
about 1
them 1
as 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
expected 1
we 1
rather 1
spread 1
ourselves 1
telling 1
of 1
the 1
advantages 1
of 1
competition 1
how 1
it 1
developed 1
fine 1
qualities 1
that 1
without 1
it 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
stimulus 1
to 1
industry 1
terry 1
was 1
very 1
strong 1
on 1
that 1
point 1
no 1
stimulus 1
to 1
industry 1
they 1
repeated 1
with 1
that 1
puzzled 1
look 1
we 1
had 1
learned 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
well 1
stimulus 1
to 1
industry 1
but 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
like 1
to 1
work 1
no 1
man 1
would 1
work 1
unless 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
terry 1
declared 1
oh 1
no 1
man 1
you 1
mean 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
sex 1
distinctions 1
no 1
indeed 1
he 1
said 1
hastily 1
no 1
one 1
i 1
mean 1
man 1
or 1
woman 1
would 1
work 1
without 1
incentive 1
competition 1
is 1
the 1
the 1
motor 1
power 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
with 1
us 1
they 1
explained 1
gently 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
hard 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
understand 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
for 1
instance 1
that 1
with 1
you 1
no 1
mother 1
would 1
work 1
for 1
her 1
children 1
without 1
the 1
stimulus 1
of 1
competition 1
no 1
he 1
admitted 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
mean 1
that 1
mothers 1
he 1
supposed 1
would 1
of 1
course 1
work 1
for 1
their 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
home 1
but 1
the 1
world 1
s 1
work 1
was 1
different 1
that 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
by 1
men 1
and 1
required 1
the 1
competitive 1
element 1
all 1
our 1
teachers 1
were 1
eagerly 1
interested 1
we 1
want 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
know 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
to 1
tell 1
us 1
of 1
and 1
we 1
have 1
only 1
our 1
little 1
land 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
two 1
of 1
you 1
the 1
two 1
sexes 1
to 1
love 1
and 1
help 1
one 1
another 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
rich 1
and 1
wonderful 1
world 1
tell 1
us 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
men 1
do 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
here 1
oh 1
everything 1
terry 1
said 1
grandly 1
the 1
men 1
do 1
everything 1
with 1
us 1
he 1
squared 1
his 1
broad 1
shoulders 1
and 1
lifted 1
his 1
chest 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
allow 1
our 1
women 1
to 1
work 1
women 1
are 1
loved 1
idolized 1
honored 1
kept 1
in 1
the 1
home 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
the 1
children 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
home 1
asked 1
somel 1
a 1
little 1
wistfully 1
but 1
zava 1
begged 1
tell 1
me 1
first 1
do 1
no 1
women 1
work 1
really 1
why 1
yes 1
terry 1
admitted 1
some 1
have 1
to 1
of 1
the 1
poorer 1
sort 1
about 1
how 1
many 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
about 1
seven 1
or 1
eight 1
million 1
said 1
jeff 1
as 1
mischievous 1
as 1
ever 1
chapter 1
6 1
comparisons 1
are 1
odious 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
proud 1
of 1
my 1
country 1
of 1
course 1
everyone 1
is 1
compared 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
lands 1
and 1
other 1
races 1
i 1
knew 1
the 1
united 1
states 1
of 1
america 1
had 1
always 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
speaking 1
modestly 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
just 1
as 1
a 1
clear 1
eyed 1
intelligent 1
perfectly 1
honest 1
and 1
well 1
meaning 1
child 1
will 1
frequently 1
jar 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
esteem 1
by 1
innocent 1
questions 1
so 1
did 1
these 1
women 1
without 1
the 1
slightest 1
appearance 1
of 1
malice 1
or 1
satire 1
continually 1
bring 1
up 1
points 1
of 1
discussion 1
which 1
we 1
spent 1
our 1
best 1
efforts 1
in 1
evading 1
now 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
fairly 1
proficient 1
in 1
their 1
language 1
had 1
read 1
a 1
lot 1
about 1
their 1
history 1
and 1
had 1
given 1
them 1
the 1
general 1
outlines 1
of 1
ours 1
they 1
were 1
able 1
to 1
press 1
their 1
questions 1
closer 1
so 1
when 1
jeff 1
admitted 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
women 1
wage 1
earners 1
we 1
had 1
they 1
instantly 1
asked 1
for 1
the 1
total 1
population 1
for 1
the 1
proportion 1
of 1
adult 1
women 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
but 1
twenty 1
million 1
or 1
so 1
at 1
the 1
outside 1
then 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
third 1
of 1
your 1
women 1
are 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
call 1
them 1
wage 1
earners 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
poor 1
what 1
is 1
poor 1
exactly 1
ours 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
to 1
poverty 1
terry 1
told 1
them 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
wretched 1
paupers 1
and 1
beggars 1
of 1
the 1
older 1
countries 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
why 1
european 1
visitors 1
tell 1
us 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
poverty 1
is 1
neither 1
do 1
we 1
answered 1
zava 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
tell 1
us 1
terry 1
put 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
me 1
saying 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
sociologist 1
and 1
i 1
explained 1
that 1
the 1
laws 1
of 1
nature 1
require 1
a 1
struggle 1
for 1
existence 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
struggle 1
the 1
fittest 1
survive 1
and 1
the 1
unfit 1
perish 1
in 1
our 1
economic 1
struggle 1
i 1
continued 1
there 1
was 1
always 1
plenty 1
of 1
opportunity 1
for 1
the 1
fittest 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
top 1
which 1
they 1
did 1
in 1
great 1
numbers 1
particularly 1
in 1
our 1
country 1
that 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
severe 1
economic 1
pressure 1
the 1
lowest 1
classes 1
of 1
course 1
felt 1
it 1
the 1
worst 1
and 1
that 1
among 1
the 1
poorest 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
women 1
were 1
driven 1
into 1
the 1
labor 1
market 1
by 1
necessity 1
they 1
listened 1
closely 1
with 1
the 1
usual 1
note 1
taking 1
about 1
one 1
third 1
then 1
belong 1
to 1
the 1
poorest 1
class 1
observed 1
moadine 1
gravely 1
and 1
two 1
thirds 1
are 1
the 1
ones 1
who 1
are 1
how 1
was 1
it 1
you 1
so 1
beautifully 1
put 1
it 1
loved 1
honored 1
kept 1
in 1
the 1
home 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
the 1
children 1
this 1
inferior 1
one 1
third 1
have 1
no 1
children 1
i 1
suppose 1
jeff 1
he 1
was 1
getting 1
as 1
bad 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
solemnly 1
replied 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
the 1
poorer 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
more 1
children 1
they 1
had 1
that 1
too 1
he 1
explained 1
was 1
a 1
law 1
of 1
nature 1
reproduction 1
is 1
in 1
inverse 1
proportion 1
to 1
individuation 1
these 1
laws 1
of 1
nature 1
zava 1
gently 1
asked 1
are 1
they 1
all 1
the 1
laws 1
you 1
have 1
i 1
should 1
say 1
not 1
protested 1
terry 1
we 1
have 1
systems 1
of 1
law 1
that 1
go 1
back 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
of 1
years 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
do 1
no 1
doubt 1
he 1
finished 1
politely 1
oh 1
no 1
moadine 1
told 1
him 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
laws 1
over 1
a 1
hundred 1
years 1
old 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
under 1
twenty 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
weeks 1
more 1
she 1
continued 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
showing 1
you 1
over 1
our 1
little 1
land 1
and 1
explaining 1
everything 1
you 1
care 1
to 1
know 1
about 1
we 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
see 1
our 1
people 1
and 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
somel 1
added 1
that 1
our 1
people 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
terry 1
brightened 1
up 1
immensely 1
at 1
this 1
news 1
and 1
reconciled 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
renewed 1
demands 1
upon 1
our 1
capacity 1
as 1
teachers 1
it 1
was 1
lucky 1
that 1
we 1
knew 1
so 1
little 1
really 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
books 1
to 1
refer 1
to 1
else 1
i 1
fancy 1
we 1
might 1
all 1
be 1
there 1
yet 1
teaching 1
those 1
eager 1
minded 1
women 1
about 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
to 1
geography 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
tradition 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
sea 1
beyond 1
the 1
mountains 1
and 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
for 1
themselves 1
the 1
endless 1
thick 1
forested 1
plains 1
below 1
them 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
but 1
from 1
the 1
few 1
records 1
of 1
their 1
ancient 1
condition 1
not 1
before 1
the 1
flood 1
with 1
them 1
but 1
before 1
that 1
mighty 1
quake 1
which 1
had 1
cut 1
them 1
off 1
so 1
completely 1
they 1
were 1
aware 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
other 1
peoples 1
and 1
other 1
countries 1
in 1
geology 1
they 1
were 1
quite 1
ignorant 1
as 1
to 1
anthropology 1
they 1
had 1
those 1
same 1
remnants 1
of 1
information 1
about 1
other 1
peoples 1
and 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
savagery 1
of 1
the 1
occupants 1
of 1
those 1
dim 1
forests 1
below 1
nevertheless 1
they 1
had 1
inferred 1
marvelously 1
keen 1
on 1
inference 1
and 1
deduction 1
their 1
minds 1
were 1
the 1
existence 1
and 1
development 1
of 1
civilization 1
in 1
other 1
places 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
infer 1
it 1
on 1
other 1
planets 1
when 1
our 1
biplane 1
came 1
whirring 1
over 1
their 1
heads 1
in 1
that 1
first 1
scouting 1
flight 1
of 1
ours 1
they 1
had 1
instantly 1
accepted 1
it 1
as 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1
high 1
development 1
of 1
some 1
where 1
else 1
and 1
had 1
prepared 1
to 1
receive 1
us 1
as 1
cautiously 1
and 1
eagerly 1
as 1
we 1
might 1
prepare 1
to 1
welcome 1
visitors 1
who 1
came 1
by 1
meteor 1
from 1
mars 1
of 1
history 1
outside 1
their 1
own 1
they 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
course 1
save 1
for 1
their 1
ancient 1
traditions 1
of 1
astronomy 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
fair 1
working 1
knowledge 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
old 1
science 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
a 1
surprising 1
range 1
and 1
facility 1
in 1
mathematics 1
physiology 1
they 1
were 1
quite 1
familiar 1
with 1
indeed 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
simpler 1
and 1
more 1
concrete 1
sciences 1
wherein 1
the 1
subject 1
matter 1
was 1
at 1
hand 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
but 1
to 1
exercise 1
their 1
minds 1
upon 1
it 1
the 1
results 1
were 1
surprising 1
they 1
had 1
worked 1
out 1
a 1
chemistry 1
a 1
botany 1
a 1
physics 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
blends 1
where 1
a 1
science 1
touches 1
an 1
art 1
or 1
merges 1
into 1
an 1
industry 1
to 1
such 1
fullness 1
of 1
knowledge 1
as 1
made 1
us 1
feel 1
like 1
schoolchildren 1
also 1
we 1
found 1
this 1
out 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
free 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
by 1
further 1
study 1
and 1
question 1
that 1
what 1
one 1
knew 1
all 1
knew 1
to 1
a 1
very 1
considerable 1
extent 1
i 1
talked 1
later 1
with 1
little 1
mountain 1
girls 1
from 1
the 1
fir 1
dark 1
valleys 1
away 1
up 1
at 1
their 1
highest 1
part 1
and 1
with 1
sunburned 1
plains 1
women 1
and 1
agile 1
foresters 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
country 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
those 1
in 1
the 1
towns 1
and 1
everywhere 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
high 1
level 1
of 1
intelligence 1
some 1
knew 1
far 1
more 1
than 1
others 1
about 1
one 1
thing 1
they 1
were 1
specialized 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
knew 1
more 1
about 1
everything 1
that 1
is 1
about 1
everything 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
acquainted 1
with 1
than 1
is 1
the 1
case 1
with 1
us 1
we 1
boast 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
our 1
high 1
level 1
of 1
general 1
intelligence 1
and 1
our 1
compulsory 1
public 1
education 1
but 1
in 1
proportion 1
to 1
their 1
opportunities 1
they 1
were 1
far 1
better 1
educated 1
than 1
our 1
people 1
with 1
what 1
we 1
told 1
them 1
from 1
what 1
sketches 1
and 1
models 1
we 1
were 1
able 1
to 1
prepare 1
they 1
constructed 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
working 1
outline 1
to 1
fill 1
in 1
as 1
they 1
learned 1
more 1
a 1
big 1
globe 1
was 1
made 1
and 1
our 1
uncertain 1
maps 1
helped 1
out 1
by 1
those 1
in 1
that 1
precious 1
yearbook 1
thing 1
i 1
had 1
were 1
tentatively 1
indicated 1
upon 1
it 1
they 1
sat 1
in 1
eager 1
groups 1
masses 1
of 1
them 1
who 1
came 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
and 1
listened 1
while 1
jeff 1
roughly 1
ran 1
over 1
the 1
geologic 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
showed 1
them 1
their 1
own 1
land 1
in 1
relation 1
to 1
the 1
others 1
out 1
of 1
that 1
same 1
pocket 1
reference 1
book 1
of 1
mine 1
came 1
facts 1
and 1
figures 1
which 1
were 1
seized 1
upon 1
and 1
placed 1
in 1
right 1
relation 1
with 1
unerring 1
acumen 1
even 1
terry 1
grew 1
interested 1
in 1
this 1
work 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
keep 1
this 1
up 1
they 1
ll 1
be 1
having 1
us 1
lecture 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
girls 1
schools 1
and 1
colleges 1
how 1
about 1
that 1
he 1
suggested 1
to 1
us 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
as 1
i 1
d 1
object 1
to 1
being 1
an 1
authority 1
to 1
such 1
audiences 1
they 1
did 1
in 1
fact 1
urge 1
us 1
to 1
give 1
public 1
lectures 1
later 1
but 1
not 1
to 1
the 1
hearers 1
or 1
with 1
the 1
purpose 1
we 1
expected 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
doing 1
with 1
us 1
was 1
like 1
like 1
well 1
say 1
like 1
napoleon 1
extracting 1
military 1
information 1
from 1
a 1
few 1
illiterate 1
peasants 1
they 1
knew 1
just 1
what 1
to 1
ask 1
and 1
just 1
what 1
use 1
to 1
make 1
of 1
it 1
they 1
had 1
mechanical 1
appliances 1
for 1
disseminating 1
information 1
almost 1
equal 1
to 1
ours 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
were 1
led 1
forth 1
to 1
lecture 1
our 1
audiences 1
had 1
thoroughly 1
mastered 1
a 1
well 1
arranged 1
digest 1
of 1
all 1
we 1
had 1
previously 1
given 1
to 1
our 1
teachers 1
and 1
were 1
prepared 1
with 1
such 1
notes 1
and 1
questions 1
as 1
might 1
have 1
intimidated 1
a 1
university 1
professor 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
audiences 1
of 1
girls 1
either 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
we 1
were 1
allowed 1
to 1
meet 1
the 1
young 1
women 1
do 1
you 1
mind 1
telling 1
what 1
you 1
intend 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
us 1
terry 1
burst 1
forth 1
one 1
day 1
facing 1
the 1
calm 1
and 1
friendly 1
moadine 1
with 1
that 1
funny 1
half 1
blustering 1
air 1
of 1
his 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
storm 1
and 1
flourish 1
quite 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
but 1
nothing 1
seemed 1
to 1
amuse 1
them 1
more 1
they 1
would 1
gather 1
around 1
and 1
watch 1
him 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
exhibition 1
politely 1
but 1
with 1
evident 1
interest 1
so 1
he 1
learned 1
to 1
check 1
himself 1
and 1
was 1
almost 1
reasonable 1
in 1
his 1
bearing 1
but 1
not 1
quite 1
she 1
announced 1
smoothly 1
and 1
evenly 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
plain 1
we 1
are 1
trying 1
to 1
learn 1
of 1
you 1
all 1
we 1
can 1
and 1
to 1
teach 1
you 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
willing 1
to 1
learn 1
of 1
our 1
country 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
he 1
insisted 1
she 1
smiled 1
a 1
quiet 1
enigmatic 1
smile 1
that 1
depends 1
depends 1
on 1
what 1
mainly 1
on 1
yourselves 1
she 1
replied 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
keep 1
us 1
shut 1
up 1
so 1
closely 1
because 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
feel 1
quite 1
safe 1
in 1
allowing 1
you 1
at 1
large 1
where 1
there 1
are 1
so 1
many 1
young 1
women 1
terry 1
was 1
really 1
pleased 1
at 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
as 1
much 1
inwardly 1
but 1
he 1
pushed 1
the 1
question 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
be 1
afraid 1
we 1
are 1
gentlemen 1
she 1
smiled 1
that 1
little 1
smile 1
again 1
and 1
asked 1
are 1
gentlemen 1
always 1
safe 1
you 1
surely 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
any 1
of 1
us 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
emphasis 1
on 1
the 1
us 1
would 1
hurt 1
your 1
young 1
girls 1
oh 1
no 1
she 1
said 1
quickly 1
in 1
real 1
surprise 1
the 1
danger 1
is 1
quite 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
they 1
might 1
hurt 1
you 1
if 1
by 1
any 1
accident 1
you 1
did 1
harm 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
face 1
a 1
million 1
mothers 1
he 1
looked 1
so 1
amazed 1
and 1
outraged 1
that 1
jeff 1
and 1
i 1
laughed 1
outright 1
but 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
gently 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
you 1
quite 1
understand 1
yet 1
you 1
are 1
but 1
men 1
three 1
men 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
where 1
the 1
whole 1
population 1
are 1
mothers 1
or 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
motherhood 1
means 1
to 1
us 1
something 1
which 1
i 1
cannot 1
yet 1
discover 1
in 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
countries 1
of 1
which 1
you 1
tell 1
us 1
you 1
have 1
spoken 1
she 1
turned 1
to 1
jeff 1
of 1
human 1
brotherhood 1
as 1
a 1
great 1
idea 1
among 1
you 1
but 1
even 1
that 1
i 1
judge 1
is 1
far 1
from 1
a 1
practical 1
expression 1
jeff 1
nodded 1
rather 1
sadly 1
very 1
far 1
he 1
said 1
here 1
we 1
have 1
human 1
motherhood 1
in 1
full 1
working 1
use 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
nothing 1
else 1
except 1
the 1
literal 1
sisterhood 1
of 1
our 1
origin 1
and 1
the 1
far 1
higher 1
and 1
deeper 1
union 1
of 1
our 1
social 1
growth 1
the 1
children 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
are 1
the 1
one 1
center 1
and 1
focus 1
of 1
all 1
our 1
thoughts 1
every 1
step 1
of 1
our 1
advance 1
is 1
always 1
considered 1
in 1
its 1
effect 1
on 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
race 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
are 1
mothers 1
she 1
repeated 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
said 1
it 1
all 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
how 1
that 1
fact 1
which 1
is 1
shared 1
by 1
all 1
women 1
constitutes 1
any 1
risk 1
to 1
us 1
terry 1
persisted 1
you 1
mean 1
they 1
would 1
defend 1
their 1
children 1
from 1
attack 1
of 1
course 1
any 1
mothers 1
would 1
but 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
savages 1
my 1
dear 1
lady 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
hurt 1
any 1
mother 1
s 1
child 1
they 1
looked 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
shook 1
their 1
heads 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
zava 1
turned 1
to 1
jeff 1
and 1
urged 1
him 1
to 1
make 1
us 1
see 1
said 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
understand 1
more 1
fully 1
than 1
we 1
did 1
and 1
he 1
tried 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
it 1
now 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
much 1
more 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
has 1
taken 1
me 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
honest 1
intellectual 1
effort 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
motherhood 1
was 1
like 1
this 1
they 1
began 1
with 1
a 1
really 1
high 1
degree 1
of 1
social 1
development 1
something 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
ancient 1
egypt 1
or 1
greece 1
then 1
they 1
suffered 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
everything 1
masculine 1
and 1
supposed 1
at 1
first 1
that 1
all 1
human 1
power 1
and 1
safety 1
had 1
gone 1
too 1
then 1
they 1
developed 1
this 1
virgin 1
birth 1
capacity 1
then 1
since 1
the 1
prosperity 1
of 1
their 1
children 1
depended 1
on 1
it 1
the 1
fullest 1
and 1
subtlest 1
coordination 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
practiced 1
i 1
remember 1
how 1
long 1
terry 1
balked 1
at 1
the 1
evident 1
unanimity 1
of 1
these 1
women 1
the 1
most 1
conspicuous 1
feature 1
of 1
their 1
whole 1
culture 1
it 1
s 1
impossible 1
he 1
would 1
insist 1
women 1
cannot 1
cooperate 1
it 1
s 1
against 1
nature 1
when 1
we 1
urged 1
the 1
obvious 1
facts 1
he 1
would 1
say 1
fiddlesticks 1
or 1
hang 1
your 1
facts 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
it 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
we 1
never 1
succeeded 1
in 1
shutting 1
him 1
up 1
till 1
jeff 1
dragged 1
in 1
the 1
hymenoptera 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
ant 1
thou 1
sluggard 1
and 1
learn 1
something 1
he 1
said 1
triumphantly 1
don 1
t 1
they 1
cooperate 1
pretty 1
well 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
beat 1
it 1
this 1
place 1
is 1
just 1
like 1
an 1
enormous 1
anthill 1
you 1
know 1
an 1
anthill 1
is 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
nursery 1
and 1
how 1
about 1
bees 1
don 1
t 1
they 1
manage 1
to 1
cooperate 1
and 1
love 1
one 1
another 1
as 1
that 1
precious 1
constable 1
had 1
it 1
just 1
show 1
me 1
a 1
combination 1
of 1
male 1
creatures 1
bird 1
bug 1
or 1
beast 1
that 1
works 1
as 1
well 1
will 1
you 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
masculine 1
countries 1
where 1
the 1
people 1
work 1
together 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
they 1
do 1
here 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
women 1
are 1
the 1
natural 1
cooperators 1
not 1
men 1
terry 1
had 1
to 1
learn 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
things 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
little 1
analysis 1
of 1
what 1
happened 1
they 1
developed 1
all 1
this 1
close 1
inter 1
service 1
in 1
the 1
interests 1
of 1
their 1
children 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
best 1
work 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
specialize 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
children 1
needed 1
spinners 1
and 1
weavers 1
farmers 1
and 1
gardeners 1
carpenters 1
and 1
masons 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
mothers 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
filling 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
when 1
a 1
population 1
multiplies 1
by 1
five 1
every 1
thirty 1
years 1
it 1
soon 1
reaches 1
the 1
limits 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
especially 1
a 1
small 1
one 1
like 1
this 1
they 1
very 1
soon 1
eliminated 1
all 1
the 1
grazing 1
cattle 1
sheep 1
were 1
the 1
last 1
to 1
go 1
i 1
believe 1
also 1
they 1
worked 1
out 1
a 1
system 1
of 1
intensive 1
agriculture 1
surpassing 1
anything 1
i 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
with 1
the 1
very 1
forests 1
all 1
reset 1
with 1
fruit 1
or 1
nut 1
bearing 1
trees 1
do 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
however 1
there 1
soon 1
came 1
a 1
time 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
confronted 1
with 1
the 1
problem 1
of 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
population 1
in 1
an 1
acute 1
form 1
there 1
was 1
really 1
crowding 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
unavoidably 1
a 1
decline 1
in 1
standards 1
and 1
how 1
did 1
those 1
women 1
meet 1
it 1
not 1
by 1
a 1
struggle 1
for 1
existence 1
which 1
would 1
result 1
in 1
an 1
everlasting 1
writhing 1
mass 1
of 1
underbred 1
people 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
ahead 1
of 1
one 1
another 1
some 1
few 1
on 1
top 1
temporarily 1
many 1
constantly 1
crushed 1
out 1
underneath 1
a 1
hopeless 1
substratum 1
of 1
paupers 1
and 1
degenerates 1
and 1
no 1
serenity 1
or 1
peace 1
for 1
anyone 1
no 1
possibility 1
for 1
really 1
noble 1
qualities 1
among 1
the 1
people 1
at 1
large 1
neither 1
did 1
they 1
start 1
off 1
on 1
predatory 1
excursions 1
to 1
get 1
more 1
land 1
from 1
somebody 1
else 1
or 1
to 1
get 1
more 1
food 1
from 1
somebody 1
else 1
to 1
maintain 1
their 1
struggling 1
mass 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
in 1
council 1
together 1
and 1
thought 1
it 1
out 1
very 1
clear 1
strong 1
thinkers 1
they 1
were 1
they 1
said 1
with 1
our 1
best 1
endeavors 1
this 1
country 1
will 1
support 1
about 1
so 1
many 1
people 1
with 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
peace 1
comfort 1
health 1
beauty 1
and 1
progress 1
we 1
demand 1
very 1
well 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
we 1
will 1
make 1
there 1
you 1
have 1
it 1
you 1
see 1
they 1
were 1
mothers 1
not 1
in 1
our 1
sense 1
of 1
helpless 1
involuntary 1
fecundity 1
forced 1
to 1
fill 1
and 1
overfill 1
the 1
land 1
every 1
land 1
and 1
then 1
see 1
their 1
children 1
suffer 1
sin 1
and 1
die 1
fighting 1
horribly 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
conscious 1
makers 1
of 1
people 1
mother 1
love 1
with 1
them 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
brute 1
passion 1
a 1
mere 1
instinct 1
a 1
wholly 1
personal 1
feeling 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
religion 1
it 1
included 1
that 1
limitless 1
feeling 1
of 1
sisterhood 1
that 1
wide 1
unity 1
in 1
service 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
difficult 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
grasp 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
national 1
racial 1
human 1
oh 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
we 1
are 1
used 1
to 1
seeing 1
what 1
we 1
call 1
a 1
mother 1
completely 1
wrapped 1
up 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
pink 1
bundle 1
of 1
fascinating 1
babyhood 1
and 1
taking 1
but 1
the 1
faintest 1
theoretic 1
interest 1
in 1
anybody 1
else 1
s 1
bundle 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
common 1
needs 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
bundles 1
but 1
these 1
women 1
were 1
working 1
all 1
together 1
at 1
the 1
grandest 1
of 1
tasks 1
they 1
were 1
making 1
people 1
and 1
they 1
made 1
them 1
well 1
there 1
followed 1
a 1
period 1
of 1
negative 1
eugenics 1
which 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
appalling 1
sacrifice 1
we 1
are 1
commonly 1
willing 1
to 1
lay 1
down 1
our 1
lives 1
for 1
our 1
country 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
to 1
forego 1
motherhood 1
for 1
their 1
country 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
precisely 1
the 1
hardest 1
thing 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
do 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
this 1
far 1
in 1
my 1
reading 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
somel 1
for 1
more 1
light 1
we 1
were 1
as 1
friendly 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
with 1
any 1
woman 1
a 1
mighty 1
comfortable 1
soul 1
she 1
was 1
giving 1
one 1
the 1
nice 1
smooth 1
mother 1
feeling 1
a 1
man 1
likes 1
in 1
a 1
woman 1
and 1
yet 1
giving 1
also 1
the 1
clear 1
intelligence 1
and 1
dependableness 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
assume 1
to 1
be 1
masculine 1
qualities 1
we 1
had 1
talked 1
volumes 1
already 1
see 1
here 1
said 1
i 1
here 1
was 1
this 1
dreadful 1
period 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
far 1
too 1
thick 1
and 1
decided 1
to 1
limit 1
the 1
population 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
talk 1
about 1
that 1
among 1
us 1
but 1
your 1
position 1
is 1
so 1
different 1
that 1
i 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
know 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
make 1
motherhood 1
the 1
highest 1
social 1
service 1
a 1
sacrament 1
really 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
undertaken 1
once 1
by 1
the 1
majority 1
of 1
the 1
population 1
that 1
those 1
held 1
unfit 1
are 1
not 1
allowed 1
even 1
that 1
and 1
that 1
to 1
be 1
encouraged 1
to 1
bear 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
child 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
highest 1
reward 1
and 1
honor 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
the 1
state 1
she 1
interpolated 1
here 1
that 1
the 1
nearest 1
approach 1
to 1
an 1
aristocracy 1
they 1
had 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
of 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
over 1
mothers 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
honored 1
but 1
what 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
understand 1
naturally 1
is 1
how 1
you 1
prevent 1
it 1
i 1
gathered 1
that 1
each 1
woman 1
had 1
five 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
tyrannical 1
husbands 1
to 1
hold 1
in 1
check 1
and 1
you 1
surely 1
do 1
not 1
destroy 1
the 1
unborn 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
ghastly 1
horror 1
she 1
gave 1
me 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
she 1
started 1
from 1
her 1
chair 1
pale 1
her 1
eyes 1
blazing 1
destroy 1
the 1
unborn 1
she 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
hard 1
whisper 1
do 1
men 1
do 1
that 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
men 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
answer 1
rather 1
hotly 1
and 1
then 1
saw 1
the 1
gulf 1
before 1
me 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
wanted 1
these 1
women 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
our 1
women 1
of 1
whom 1
we 1
boasted 1
so 1
proudly 1
were 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
inferior 1
to 1
them 1
i 1
am 1
ashamed 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
equivocated 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
of 1
certain 1
criminal 1
types 1
of 1
women 1
perverts 1
or 1
crazy 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
known 1
to 1
commit 1
infanticide 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
truly 1
enough 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
much 1
in 1
our 1
land 1
which 1
was 1
open 1
to 1
criticism 1
but 1
that 1
i 1
hated 1
to 1
dwell 1
on 1
our 1
defects 1
until 1
they 1
understood 1
us 1
and 1
our 1
conditions 1
better 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
wide 1
detour 1
i 1
scrambled 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
question 1
of 1
how 1
they 1
limited 1
the 1
population 1
as 1
for 1
somel 1
she 1
seemed 1
sorry 1
a 1
little 1
ashamed 1
even 1
of 1
her 1
too 1
clearly 1
expressed 1
amazement 1
as 1
i 1
look 1
back 1
now 1
knowing 1
them 1
better 1
i 1
am 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
amazed 1
as 1
i 1
appreciate 1
the 1
exquisite 1
courtesy 1
with 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
received 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
statements 1
and 1
admissions 1
on 1
our 1
part 1
which 1
must 1
have 1
revolted 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
soul 1
she 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
sweet 1
seriousness 1
that 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
supposed 1
at 1
first 1
each 1
woman 1
bore 1
five 1
children 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
their 1
eager 1
desire 1
to 1
build 1
up 1
a 1
nation 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
centuries 1
till 1
they 1
were 1
confronted 1
with 1
the 1
absolute 1
need 1
of 1
a 1
limit 1
this 1
fact 1
was 1
equally 1
plain 1
to 1
all 1
all 1
were 1
equally 1
interested 1
they 1
were 1
now 1
as 1
anxious 1
to 1
check 1
their 1
wonderful 1
power 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
to 1
develop 1
it 1
and 1
for 1
some 1
generations 1
gave 1
the 1
matter 1
their 1
most 1
earnest 1
thought 1
and 1
study 1
we 1
were 1
living 1
on 1
rations 1
before 1
we 1
worked 1
it 1
out 1
she 1
said 1
but 1
we 1
did 1
work 1
it 1
out 1
you 1
see 1
before 1
a 1
child 1
comes 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
period 1
of 1
utter 1
exaltation 1
the 1
whole 1
being 1
is 1
uplifted 1
and 1
filled 1
with 1
a 1
concentrated 1
desire 1
for 1
that 1
child 1
we 1
learned 1
to 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
that 1
period 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
caution 1
often 1
our 1
young 1
women 1
those 1
to 1
whom 1
motherhood 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
come 1
would 1
voluntarily 1
defer 1
it 1
when 1
that 1
deep 1
inner 1
demand 1
for 1
a 1
child 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
felt 1
she 1
would 1
deliberately 1
engage 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
active 1
work 1
physical 1
and 1
mental 1
and 1
even 1
more 1
important 1
would 1
solace 1
her 1
longing 1
by 1
the 1
direct 1
care 1
and 1
service 1
of 1
the 1
babies 1
we 1
already 1
had 1
she 1
paused 1
her 1
wise 1
sweet 1
face 1
grew 1
deeply 1
reverently 1
tender 1
we 1
soon 1
grew 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
mother 1
love 1
has 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
channel 1
of 1
expression 1
i 1
think 1
the 1
reason 1
our 1
children 1
are 1
so 1
so 1
fully 1
loved 1
by 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
is 1
that 1
we 1
never 1
any 1
of 1
us 1
have 1
enough 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
this 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
infinitely 1
pathetic 1
and 1
i 1
said 1
so 1
we 1
have 1
much 1
that 1
is 1
bitter 1
and 1
hard 1
in 1
our 1
life 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
but 1
this 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
piteous 1
beyond 1
words 1
a 1
whole 1
nation 1
of 1
starving 1
mothers 1
but 1
she 1
smiled 1
her 1
deep 1
contented 1
smile 1
and 1
said 1
i 1
quite 1
misunderstood 1
we 1
each 1
go 1
without 1
a 1
certain 1
range 1
of 1
personal 1
joy 1
she 1
said 1
but 1
remember 1
we 1
each 1
have 1
a 1
million 1
children 1
to 1
love 1
and 1
serve 1
our 1
children 1
it 1
was 1
beyond 1
me 1
to 1
hear 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
women 1
talk 1
about 1
our 1
children 1
but 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
the 1
ants 1
and 1
bees 1
would 1
talk 1
do 1
talk 1
maybe 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
they 1
did 1
anyhow 1
when 1
a 1
woman 1
chose 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
mother 1
she 1
allowed 1
the 1
child 1
longing 1
to 1
grow 1
within 1
her 1
till 1
it 1
worked 1
its 1
natural 1
miracle 1
when 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
so 1
choose 1
she 1
put 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
mind 1
and 1
fed 1
her 1
heart 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
babies 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
with 1
us 1
children 1
minors 1
that 1
is 1
constitute 1
about 1
three 1
fifths 1
of 1
the 1
population 1
with 1
them 1
only 1
about 1
one 1
third 1
or 1
less 1
and 1
precious 1
no 1
sole 1
heir 1
to 1
an 1
empire 1
s 1
throne 1
no 1
solitary 1
millionaire 1
baby 1
no 1
only 1
child 1
of 1
middle 1
aged 1
parents 1
could 1
compare 1
as 1
an 1
idol 1
with 1
these 1
herland 1
children 1
but 1
before 1
i 1
start 1
on 1
that 1
subject 1
i 1
must 1
finish 1
up 1
that 1
little 1
analysis 1
i 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
make 1
they 1
did 1
effectually 1
and 1
permanently 1
limit 1
the 1
population 1
in 1
numbers 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
country 1
furnished 1
plenty 1
for 1
the 1
fullest 1
richest 1
life 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
plenty 1
of 1
everything 1
including 1
room 1
air 1
solitude 1
even 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
improve 1
that 1
population 1
in 1
quality 1
since 1
they 1
were 1
restricted 1
in 1
quantity 1
this 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
work 1
on 1
uninterruptedly 1
for 1
some 1
fifteen 1
hundred 1
years 1
do 1
you 1
wonder 1
they 1
were 1
nice 1
people 1
physiology 1
hygiene 1
sanitation 1
physical 1
culture 1
all 1
that 1
line 1
of 1
work 1
had 1
been 1
perfected 1
long 1
since 1
sickness 1
was 1
almost 1
wholly 1
unknown 1
among 1
them 1
so 1
much 1
so 1
that 1
a 1
previously 1
high 1
development 1
in 1
what 1
we 1
call 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
medicine 1
had 1
become 1
practically 1
a 1
lost 1
art 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
clean 1
bred 1
vigorous 1
lot 1
having 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
care 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
living 1
conditions 1
always 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
psychology 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
thing 1
which 1
left 1
us 1
so 1
dumbfounded 1
so 1
really 1
awed 1
as 1
the 1
everyday 1
working 1
knowledge 1
and 1
practice 1
they 1
had 1
in 1
this 1
line 1
as 1
we 1
learned 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
of 1
it 1
we 1
learned 1
to 1
appreciate 1
the 1
exquisite 1
mastery 1
with 1
which 1
we 1
ourselves 1
strangers 1
of 1
alien 1
race 1
of 1
unknown 1
opposite 1
sex 1
had 1
been 1
understood 1
and 1
provided 1
for 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
with 1
this 1
wide 1
deep 1
thorough 1
knowledge 1
they 1
had 1
met 1
and 1
solved 1
the 1
problems 1
of 1
education 1
in 1
ways 1
some 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
hope 1
to 1
make 1
clear 1
later 1
those 1
nation 1
loved 1
children 1
of 1
theirs 1
compared 1
with 1
the 1
average 1
in 1
our 1
country 1
as 1
the 1
most 1
perfectly 1
cultivated 1
richly 1
developed 1
roses 1
compare 1
with 1
tumbleweeds 1
yet 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
cultivated 1
at 1
all 1
it 1
had 1
all 1
become 1
a 1
natural 1
condition 1
and 1
this 1
people 1
steadily 1
developing 1
in 1
mental 1
capacity 1
in 1
will 1
power 1
in 1
social 1
devotion 1
had 1
been 1
playing 1
with 1
the 1
arts 1
and 1
sciences 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
they 1
knew 1
them 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
centuries 1
now 1
with 1
inevitable 1
success 1
into 1
this 1
quiet 1
lovely 1
land 1
among 1
these 1
wise 1
sweet 1
strong 1
women 1
we 1
in 1
our 1
easy 1
assumption 1
of 1
superiority 1
had 1
suddenly 1
arrived 1
and 1
now 1
tamed 1
and 1
trained 1
to 1
a 1
degree 1
they 1
considered 1
safe 1
we 1
were 1
at 1
last 1
brought 1
out 1
to 1
see 1

7 1
our 1
growing 1
modesty 1
being 1
at 1
last 1
considered 1
sufficiently 1
tamed 1
and 1
trained 1
to 1
be 1
trusted 1
with 1
scissors 1
we 1
barbered 1
ourselves 1
as 1
best 1
we 1
could 1
a 1
close 1
trimmed 1
beard 1
is 1
certainly 1
more 1
comfortable 1
than 1
a 1
full 1
one 1
razors 1
naturally 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
supply 1
with 1
so 1
many 1
old 1
women 1
you 1
d 1
think 1
there 1
d 1
be 1
some 1
razors 1
sneered 1
terry 1
whereat 1
jeff 1
pointed 1
out 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
before 1
had 1
seen 1
such 1
complete 1
absence 1
of 1
facial 1
hair 1
on 1
women 1
looks 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
men 1
made 1
them 1
more 1
feminine 1
in 1
that 1
regard 1
anyhow 1
he 1
suggested 1
well 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
then 1
terry 1
reluctantly 1
agreed 1
a 1
less 1
feminine 1
lot 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
child 1
apiece 1
doesn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
enough 1
to 1
develop 1
what 1
i 1
call 1
motherliness 1
terry 1
s 1
idea 1
of 1
motherliness 1
was 1
the 1
usual 1
one 1
involving 1
a 1
baby 1
in 1
arms 1
or 1
a 1
little 1
flock 1
about 1
her 1
knees 1
and 1
the 1
complete 1
absorption 1
of 1
the 1
mother 1
in 1
said 1
baby 1
or 1
flock 1
a 1
motherliness 1
which 1
dominated 1
society 1
which 1
influenced 1
every 1
art 1
and 1
industry 1
which 1
absolutely 1
protected 1
all 1
childhood 1
and 1
gave 1
to 1
it 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
care 1
and 1
training 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
motherly 1
to 1
terry 1
we 1
had 1
become 1
well 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
clothes 1
they 1
were 1
quite 1
as 1
comfortable 1
as 1
our 1
own 1
in 1
some 1
ways 1
more 1
so 1
and 1
undeniably 1
better 1
looking 1
as 1
to 1
pockets 1
they 1
left 1
nothing 1
to 1
be 1
desired 1
that 1
second 1
garment 1
was 1
fairly 1
quilted 1
with 1
pockets 1
they 1
were 1
most 1
ingeniously 1
arranged 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
convenient 1
to 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
not 1
inconvenient 1
to 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
were 1
so 1
placed 1
as 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
strengthen 1
the 1
garment 1
and 1
add 1
decorative 1
lines 1
of 1
stitching 1
in 1
this 1
as 1
in 1
so 1
many 1
other 1
points 1
we 1
had 1
now 1
to 1
observe 1
there 1
was 1
shown 1
the 1
action 1
of 1
a 1
practical 1
intelligence 1
coupled 1
with 1
fine 1
artistic 1
feeling 1
and 1
apparently 1
untrammeled 1
by 1
any 1
injurious 1
influences 1
our 1
first 1
step 1
of 1
comparative 1
freedom 1
was 1
a 1
personally 1
conducted 1
tour 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
no 1
pentagonal 1
bodyguard 1
now 1
only 1
our 1
special 1
tutors 1
and 1
we 1
got 1
on 1
famously 1
with 1
them 1
jeff 1
said 1
he 1
loved 1
zava 1
like 1
an 1
aunt 1
only 1
jollier 1
than 1
any 1
aunt 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
somel 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
as 1
chummy 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
friends 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
funny 1
to 1
watch 1
terry 1
and 1
moadine 1
she 1
was 1
patient 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
courteous 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
patience 1
and 1
courtesy 1
of 1
some 1
great 1
man 1
say 1
a 1
skilled 1
experienced 1
diplomat 1
with 1
a 1
schoolgirl 1
her 1
grave 1
acquiescence 1
with 1
his 1
most 1
preposterous 1
expression 1
of 1
feeling 1
her 1
genial 1
laughter 1
not 1
only 1
with 1
but 1
i 1
often 1
felt 1
at 1
him 1
though 1
impeccably 1
polite 1
her 1
innocent 1
questions 1
which 1
almost 1
invariably 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
say 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
intended 1
jeff 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
all 1
amusing 1
to 1
watch 1
he 1
never 1
seemed 1
to 1
recognize 1
that 1
quiet 1
background 1
of 1
superiority 1
when 1
she 1
dropped 1
an 1
argument 1
he 1
always 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
silenced 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
laughed 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
tribute 1
to 1
his 1
wit 1
i 1
hated 1
to 1
admit 1
to 1
myself 1
how 1
much 1
terry 1
had 1
sunk 1
in 1
my 1
esteem 1
jeff 1
felt 1
it 1
too 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
but 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
admitted 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
at 1
home 1
we 1
had 1
measured 1
him 1
with 1
other 1
men 1
and 1
though 1
we 1
knew 1
his 1
failings 1
he 1
was 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
an 1
unusual 1
type 1
we 1
knew 1
his 1
virtues 1
too 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
always 1
seemed 1
more 1
prominent 1
than 1
the 1
faults 1
measured 1
among 1
women 1
our 1
women 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
mean 1
he 1
had 1
always 1
stood 1
high 1
he 1
was 1
visibly 1
popular 1
even 1
where 1
his 1
habits 1
were 1
known 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
discrimination 1
against 1
him 1
in 1
some 1
cases 1
his 1
reputation 1
for 1
what 1
was 1
felicitously 1
termed 1
gaiety 1
seemed 1
a 1
special 1
charm 1
but 1
here 1
against 1
the 1
calm 1
wisdom 1
and 1
quiet 1
restrained 1
humor 1
of 1
these 1
women 1
with 1
only 1
that 1
blessed 1
jeff 1
and 1
my 1
inconspicuous 1
self 1
to 1
compare 1
with 1
terry 1
did 1
stand 1
out 1
rather 1
strong 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
among 1
men 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
among 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
to 1
say 1
females 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
his 1
intense 1
masculinity 1
seemed 1
only 1
fit 1
complement 1
to 1
their 1
intense 1
femininity 1
but 1
here 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
drawing 1
moadine 1
was 1
a 1
big 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
balanced 1
strength 1
that 1
seldom 1
showed 1
her 1
eye 1
was 1
as 1
quietly 1
watchful 1
as 1
a 1
fencer 1
s 1
she 1
maintained 1
a 1
pleasant 1
relation 1
with 1
her 1
charge 1
but 1
i 1
doubt 1
if 1
many 1
even 1
in 1
that 1
country 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
as 1
well 1
he 1
called 1
her 1
maud 1
amongst 1
ourselves 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
old 1
soul 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
slow 1
wherein 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
wrong 1
needless 1
to 1
say 1
he 1
called 1
jeff 1
s 1
teacher 1
java 1
and 1
sometimes 1
mocha 1
or 1
plain 1
coffee 1
when 1
specially 1
mischievous 1
chicory 1
and 1
even 1
postum 1
but 1
somel 1
rather 1
escaped 1
this 1
form 1
of 1
humor 1
save 1
for 1
a 1
rather 1
forced 1
some 1
ell 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
people 1
have 1
but 1
one 1
name 1
he 1
asked 1
one 1
day 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
introduced 1
to 1
a 1
whole 1
group 1
of 1
them 1
all 1
with 1
pleasant 1
few 1
syllabled 1
strange 1
names 1
like 1
the 1
ones 1
we 1
knew 1
oh 1
yes 1
moadine 1
told 1
him 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
of 1
us 1
have 1
another 1
as 1
we 1
get 1
on 1
in 1
life 1
a 1
descriptive 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
name 1
we 1
earn 1
sometimes 1
even 1
that 1
is 1
changed 1
or 1
added 1
to 1
in 1
an 1
unusually 1
rich 1
life 1
such 1
as 1
our 1
present 1
land 1
mother 1
what 1
you 1
call 1
president 1
or 1
king 1
i 1
believe 1
she 1
was 1
called 1
mera 1
even 1
as 1
a 1
child 1
that 1
means 1
thinker 1
later 1
there 1
was 1
added 1
du 1
du 1
mera 1
the 1
wise 1
thinker 1
and 1
now 1
we 1
all 1
know 1
her 1
as 1
o 1
du 1
mera 1
great 1
and 1
wise 1
thinker 1
you 1
shall 1
meet 1
her 1
no 1
surnames 1
at 1
all 1
then 1
pursued 1
terry 1
with 1
his 1
somewhat 1
patronizing 1
air 1
no 1
family 1
name 1
why 1
no 1
she 1
said 1
why 1
should 1
we 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
descended 1
from 1
a 1
common 1
source 1
all 1
one 1
family 1
in 1
reality 1
you 1
see 1
our 1
comparatively 1
brief 1
and 1
limited 1
history 1
gives 1
us 1
that 1
advantage 1
at 1
least 1
but 1
does 1
not 1
each 1
mother 1
want 1
her 1
own 1
child 1
to 1
bear 1
her 1
name 1
i 1
asked 1
no 1
why 1
should 1
she 1
the 1
child 1
has 1
its 1
own 1
why 1
for 1
for 1
identification 1
so 1
people 1
will 1
know 1
whose 1
child 1
she 1
is 1
we 1
keep 1
the 1
most 1
careful 1
records 1
said 1
somel 1
each 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
has 1
our 1
exact 1
line 1
of 1
descent 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
dear 1
first 1
mother 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
reasons 1
for 1
doing 1
that 1
but 1
as 1
to 1
everyone 1
knowing 1
which 1
child 1
belongs 1
to 1
which 1
mother 1
why 1
should 1
she 1
here 1
as 1
in 1
so 1
many 1
other 1
instances 1
we 1
were 1
led 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
difference 1
between 1
the 1
purely 1
maternal 1
and 1
the 1
paternal 1
attitude 1
of 1
mind 1
the 1
element 1
of 1
personal 1
pride 1
seemed 1
strangely 1
lacking 1
how 1
about 1
your 1
other 1
works 1
asked 1
jeff 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
sign 1
your 1
names 1
to 1
them 1
books 1
and 1
statues 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
yes 1
surely 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
glad 1
and 1
proud 1
to 1
not 1
only 1
books 1
and 1
statues 1
but 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
work 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
little 1
names 1
on 1
the 1
houses 1
on 1
the 1
furniture 1
on 1
the 1
dishes 1
sometimes 1
because 1
otherwise 1
one 1
is 1
likely 1
to 1
forget 1
and 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
to 1
whom 1
to 1
be 1
grateful 1
you 1
speak 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
done 1
for 1
the 1
convenience 1
of 1
the 1
consumer 1
not 1
the 1
pride 1
of 1
the 1
producer 1
i 1
suggested 1
it 1
s 1
both 1
said 1
somel 1
we 1
have 1
pride 1
enough 1
in 1
our 1
work 1
then 1
why 1
not 1
in 1
your 1
children 1
urged 1
jeff 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
we 1
re 1
magnificently 1
proud 1
of 1
them 1
she 1
insisted 1
then 1
why 1
not 1
sign 1
em 1
said 1
terry 1
triumphantly 1
moadine 1
turned 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
slightly 1
quizzical 1
smile 1
because 1
the 1
finished 1
product 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
private 1
one 1
when 1
they 1
are 1
babies 1
we 1
do 1
speak 1
of 1
them 1
at 1
times 1
as 1
essa 1
s 1
lato 1
or 1
novine 1
s 1
amel 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
merely 1
descriptive 1
and 1
conversational 1
in 1
the 1
records 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
child 1
stands 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
line 1
of 1
mothers 1
but 1
in 1
dealing 1
with 1
it 1
personally 1
it 1
is 1
lato 1
or 1
amel 1
without 1
dragging 1
in 1
its 1
ancestors 1
but 1
have 1
you 1
names 1
enough 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
new 1
one 1
to 1
each 1
child 1
assuredly 1
we 1
have 1
for 1
each 1
living 1
generation 1
then 1
they 1
asked 1
about 1
our 1
methods 1
and 1
found 1
first 1
that 1
we 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
so 1
and 1
then 1
that 1
other 1
nations 1
did 1
differently 1
upon 1
which 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
which 1
method 1
has 1
been 1
proved 1
best 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
admit 1
that 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
knew 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
no 1
attempt 1
at 1
comparison 1
each 1
people 1
pursuing 1
its 1
own 1
custom 1
in 1
the 1
fond 1
conviction 1
of 1
superiority 1
and 1
either 1
despising 1
or 1
quite 1
ignoring 1
the 1
others 1
with 1
these 1
women 1
the 1
most 1
salient 1
quality 1
in 1
all 1
their 1
institutions 1
was 1
reasonableness 1
when 1
i 1
dug 1
into 1
the 1
records 1
to 1
follow 1
out 1
any 1
line 1
of 1
development 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
astonishing 1
thing 1
the 1
conscious 1
effort 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
better 1
they 1
had 1
early 1
observed 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
certain 1
improvements 1
had 1
easily 1
inferred 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
room 1
for 1
more 1
and 1
took 1
the 1
greatest 1
pains 1
to 1
develop 1
two 1
kinds 1
of 1
minds 1
the 1
critic 1
and 1
inventor 1
those 1
who 1
showed 1
an 1
early 1
tendency 1
to 1
observe 1
to 1
discriminate 1
to 1
suggest 1
were 1
given 1
special 1
training 1
for 1
that 1
function 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
their 1
highest 1
officials 1
spent 1
their 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
careful 1
study 1
of 1
one 1
or 1
another 1
branch 1
of 1
work 1
with 1
a 1
view 1
to 1
its 1
further 1
improvement 1
in 1
each 1
generation 1
there 1
was 1
sure 1
to 1
arrive 1
some 1
new 1
mind 1
to 1
detect 1
faults 1
and 1
show 1
need 1
of 1
alterations 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
corps 1
of 1
inventors 1
was 1
at 1
hand 1
to 1
apply 1
their 1
special 1
faculty 1
at 1
the 1
point 1
criticized 1
and 1
offer 1
suggestions 1
we 1
had 1
learned 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
not 1
to 1
open 1
a 1
discussion 1
on 1
any 1
of 1
their 1
characteristics 1
without 1
first 1
priming 1
ourselves 1
to 1
answer 1
questions 1
about 1
our 1
own 1
methods 1
so 1
i 1
kept 1
rather 1
quiet 1
on 1
this 1
matter 1
of 1
conscious 1
improvement 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
prepared 1
to 1
show 1
our 1
way 1
was 1
better 1
there 1
was 1
growing 1
in 1
our 1
minds 1
at 1
least 1
in 1
jeff 1
s 1
and 1
mine 1
a 1
keen 1
appreciation 1
of 1
the 1
advantages 1
of 1
this 1
strange 1
country 1
and 1
its 1
management 1
terry 1
remained 1
critical 1
we 1
laid 1
most 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
nerves 1
he 1
certainly 1
was 1
irritable 1
the 1
most 1
conspicuous 1
feature 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
land 1
was 1
the 1
perfection 1
of 1
its 1
food 1
supply 1
we 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
notice 1
from 1
that 1
very 1
first 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
first 1
partial 1
view 1
from 1
our 1
plane 1
now 1
we 1
were 1
taken 1
to 1
see 1
this 1
mighty 1
garden 1
and 1
shown 1
its 1
methods 1
of 1
culture 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
holland 1
some 1
ten 1
or 1
twelve 1
thousand 1
square 1
miles 1
one 1
could 1
lose 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
hollands 1
along 1
the 1
forest 1
smothered 1
flanks 1
of 1
those 1
mighty 1
mountains 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
population 1
of 1
about 1
three 1
million 1
not 1
a 1
large 1
one 1
but 1
quality 1
is 1
something 1
three 1
million 1
is 1
quite 1
enough 1
to 1
allow 1
for 1
considerable 1
variation 1
and 1
these 1
people 1
varied 1
more 1
widely 1
than 1
we 1
could 1
at 1
first 1
account 1
for 1
terry 1
had 1
insisted 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
parthenogenetic 1
they 1
d 1
be 1
as 1
alike 1
as 1
so 1
many 1
ants 1
or 1
aphids 1
he 1
urged 1
their 1
visible 1
differences 1
as 1
proof 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
men 1
somewhere 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
asked 1
them 1
in 1
our 1
later 1
more 1
intimate 1
conversations 1
how 1
they 1
accounted 1
for 1
so 1
much 1
divergence 1
without 1
cross 1
fertilization 1
they 1
attributed 1
it 1
partly 1
to 1
the 1
careful 1
education 1
which 1
followed 1
each 1
slight 1
tendency 1
to 1
differ 1
and 1
partly 1
to 1
the 1
law 1
of 1
mutation 1
this 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
their 1
work 1
with 1
plants 1
and 1
fully 1
proven 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
case 1
physically 1
they 1
were 1
more 1
alike 1
than 1
we 1
as 1
they 1
lacked 1
all 1
morbid 1
or 1
excessive 1
types 1
they 1
were 1
tall 1
strong 1
healthy 1
and 1
beautiful 1
as 1
a 1
race 1
but 1
differed 1
individually 1
in 1
a 1
wide 1
range 1
of 1
feature 1
coloring 1
and 1
expression 1
but 1
surely 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
growth 1
is 1
in 1
mind 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
make 1
urged 1
somel 1
do 1
you 1
find 1
your 1
physical 1
variation 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
proportionate 1
variation 1
in 1
ideas 1

and 1
products 1
or 1
among 1
people 1

you 1
find 1
their 1
internal 1
life 1
and 1
their 1
work 1
as 1
similar 1
we 1
were 1
rather 1
doubtful 1
on 1
this 1
point 1
and 1
inclined 1
to 1
hold 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
more 1
chance 1
of 1
improvement 1
in 1
greater 1
physical 1
variation 1
it 1
certainly 1
should 1
be 1
zava 1
admitted 1
we 1
have 1
always 1
thought 1
it 1
a 1
grave 1
initial 1
misfortune 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
half 1
our 1
little 1
world 1
perhaps 1
that 1
is 1
one 1
reason 1
why 1
we 1
have 1
so 1
striven 1
for 1
conscious 1
improvement 1
but 1
acquired 1
traits 1
are 1
not 1
transmissible 1
terry 1
declared 1
weissman 1
has 1
proved 1
that 1
they 1
never 1
disputed 1
our 1
absolute 1
statements 1
only 1
made 1
notes 1
of 1
them 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
so 1
then 1
our 1
improvement 1
must 1
be 1
due 1
either 1
to 1
mutation 1
or 1
solely 1
to 1
education 1
she 1
gravely 1
pursued 1
we 1
certainly 1
have 1
improved 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
that 1
all 1
these 1
higher 1
qualities 1
were 1
latent 1
in 1
the 1
original 1
mother 1
that 1
careful 1
education 1
is 1
bringing 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
that 1
our 1
personal 1
differences 1
depend 1
on 1
slight 1
variations 1
in 1
prenatal 1
condition 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
more 1
in 1
your 1
accumulated 1
culture 1
jeff 1
suggested 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
amazing 1
psychic 1
growth 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
we 1
know 1
very 1
little 1
about 1
methods 1
of 1
real 1
soul 1
culture 1
and 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
know 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
be 1
that 1
as 1
it 1
might 1
they 1
certainly 1
presented 1
a 1
higher 1
level 1
of 1
active 1
intelligence 1
and 1
of 1
behavior 1
than 1
we 1
had 1
so 1
far 1
really 1
grasped 1
having 1
known 1
in 1
our 1
lives 1
several 1
people 1
who 1
showed 1
the 1
same 1
delicate 1
courtesy 1
and 1
were 1
equally 1
pleasant 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
at 1
least 1
when 1
they 1
wore 1
their 1
company 1
manners 1
we 1
had 1
assumed 1
that 1
our 1
companions 1
were 1
a 1
carefully 1
chosen 1
few 1
later 1
we 1
were 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
impressed 1
that 1
all 1
this 1
gentle 1
breeding 1
was 1
breeding 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
born 1
to 1
it 1
reared 1
in 1
it 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
natural 1
and 1
universal 1
with 1
them 1
as 1
the 1
gentleness 1
of 1
doves 1
or 1
the 1
alleged 1
wisdom 1
of 1
serpents 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
intelligence 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
impressive 1
and 1
to 1
me 1
most 1
mortifying 1
of 1
any 1
single 1
feature 1
of 1
herland 1
we 1
soon 1
ceased 1
to 1
comment 1
on 1
this 1
or 1
other 1
matters 1
which 1
to 1
them 1
were 1
such 1
obvious 1
commonplaces 1
as 1
to 1
call 1
forth 1
embarrassing 1
questions 1
about 1
our 1
own 1
conditions 1
this 1
was 1
nowhere 1
better 1
shown 1
than 1
in 1
that 1
matter 1
of 1
food 1
supply 1
which 1
i 1
will 1
now 1
attempt 1
to 1
describe 1
having 1
improved 1
their 1
agriculture 1
to 1
the 1
highest 1
point 1
and 1
carefully 1
estimated 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
persons 1
who 1
could 1
comfortably 1
live 1
on 1
their 1
square 1
miles 1
having 1
then 1
limited 1
their 1
population 1
to 1
that 1
number 1
one 1
would 1
think 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
thought 1
so 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
a 1
unit 1
it 1
was 1
theirs 1
they 1
themselves 1
were 1
a 1
unit 1
a 1
conscious 1
group 1
they 1
thought 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
the 1
community 1
as 1
such 1
their 1
time 1
sense 1
was 1
not 1
limited 1
to 1
the 1
hopes 1
and 1
ambitions 1
of 1
an 1
individual 1
life 1
therefore 1
they 1
habitually 1
considered 1
and 1
carried 1
out 1
plans 1
for 1
improvement 1
which 1
might 1
cover 1
centuries 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
had 1
scarcely 1
imagined 1
human 1
beings 1
undertaking 1
such 1
a 1
work 1
as 1
the 1
deliberate 1
replanting 1
of 1
an 1
entire 1
forest 1
area 1
with 1
different 1
kinds 1
of 1
trees 1
yet 1
this 1
seemed 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
simplest 1
common 1
sense 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
plowing 1
up 1
an 1
inferior 1
lawn 1
and 1
reseeding 1
it 1
now 1
every 1
tree 1
bore 1
fruit 1
edible 1
fruit 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
one 1
tree 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
took 1
especial 1
pride 1
it 1
had 1
originally 1
no 1
fruit 1
at 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
none 1
humanly 1
edible 1
yet 1
was 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
they 1
wished 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
for 1
nine 1
hundred 1
years 1
they 1
had 1
experimented 1
and 1
now 1
showed 1
us 1
this 1
particularly 1
lovely 1
graceful 1
tree 1
with 1
a 1
profuse 1
crop 1
of 1
nutritious 1
seeds 1
they 1
had 1
early 1
decided 1
that 1
trees 1
were 1
the 1
best 1
food 1
plants 1
requiring 1
far 1
less 1
labor 1
in 1
tilling 1
the 1
soil 1
and 1
bearing 1
a 1
larger 1
amount 1
of 1
food 1
for 1
the 1
same 1
ground 1
space 1
also 1
doing 1
much 1
to 1
preserve 1
and 1
enrich 1
the 1
soil 1
due 1
regard 1
had 1
been 1
paid 1
to 1
seasonable 1
crops 1
and 1
their 1
fruit 1
and 1
nuts 1
grains 1
and 1
berries 1
kept 1
on 1
almost 1
the 1
year 1
through 1
on 1
the 1
higher 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
near 1
the 1
backing 1
wall 1
of 1
mountains 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
real 1
winter 1
with 1
snow 1
toward 1
the 1
south 1
eastern 1
point 1
where 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
valley 1
with 1
a 1
lake 1
whose 1
outlet 1
was 1
subterranean 1
the 1
climate 1
was 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
california 1
and 1
citrus 1
fruits 1
figs 1
and 1
olives 1
grew 1
abundantly 1
what 1
impressed 1
me 1
particularly 1
was 1
their 1
scheme 1
of 1
fertilization 1
here 1
was 1
this 1
little 1
shut 1
in 1
piece 1
of 1
land 1
where 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
an 1
ordinary 1
people 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
starved 1
out 1
long 1
ago 1
or 1
reduced 1
to 1
an 1
annual 1
struggle 1
for 1
life 1
these 1
careful 1
culturists 1
had 1
worked 1
out 1
a 1
perfect 1
scheme 1
of 1
refeeding 1
the 1
soil 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
scraps 1
and 1
leavings 1
of 1
their 1
food 1
plant 1
waste 1
from 1
lumber 1
work 1
or 1
textile 1
industry 1
all 1
the 1
solid 1
matter 1
from 1
the 1
sewage 1
properly 1
treated 1
and 1
combined 1
everything 1
which 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
earth 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
it 1
the 1
practical 1
result 1
was 1
like 1
that 1
in 1
any 1
healthy 1
forest 1
an 1
increasingly 1
valuable 1
soil 1
was 1
being 1
built 1
instead 1
of 1
the 1
progressive 1
impoverishment 1
so 1
often 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
when 1
this 1
first 1
burst 1
upon 1
us 1
we 1
made 1
such 1
approving 1
comments 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
surprised 1
that 1
such 1
obvious 1
common 1
sense 1
should 1
be 1
praised 1
asked 1
what 1
our 1
methods 1
were 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
some 1
difficulty 1
in 1
well 1
in 1
diverting 1
them 1
by 1
referring 1
to 1
the 1
extent 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
land 1
and 1
the 1
admitted 1
carelessness 1
with 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
skimmed 1
the 1
cream 1
of 1
it 1
at 1
least 1
we 1
thought 1
we 1
had 1
diverted 1
them 1
later 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
besides 1
keeping 1
a 1
careful 1
and 1
accurate 1
account 1
of 1
all 1
we 1
told 1
them 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
skeleton 1
chart 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
said 1
and 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
palpably 1
avoided 1
saying 1
were 1
all 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
studied 1
it 1
really 1
was 1
child 1
s 1
play 1
for 1
those 1
profound 1
educators 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
a 1
painfully 1
accurate 1
estimate 1
of 1
our 1
conditions 1
in 1
some 1
lines 1
when 1
a 1
given 1
line 1
of 1
observation 1
seemed 1
to 1
lead 1
to 1
some 1
very 1
dreadful 1
inference 1
they 1
always 1
gave 1
us 1
the 1
benefit 1
of 1
the 1
doubt 1
leaving 1
it 1
open 1
to 1
further 1
knowledge 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
had 1
grown 1
to 1
accept 1
as 1
perfectly 1
natural 1
or 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
our 1
human 1
limitations 1
they 1
literally 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
believed 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
we 1
had 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
joined 1
in 1
a 1
tacit 1
endeavor 1
to 1
conceal 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
social 1
status 1
at 1
home 1
confound 1
their 1
grandmotherly 1
minds 1
terry 1
said 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
can 1
t 1
understand 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
world 1
they 1
aren 1
t 1
human 1
they 1
re 1
just 1
a 1
pack 1
of 1
fe 1
fe 1
females 1
this 1
was 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
admit 1
their 1
parthenogenesis 1
i 1
wish 1
our 1
grandfatherly 1
minds 1
had 1
managed 1
as 1
well 1
said 1
jeff 1
do 1
you 1
really 1
think 1
it 1
s 1
to 1
our 1
credit 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
muddled 1
along 1
with 1
all 1
our 1
poverty 1
and 1
disease 1
and 1
the 1
like 1
they 1
have 1
peace 1
and 1
plenty 1
wealth 1
and 1
beauty 1
goodness 1
and 1
intellect 1
pretty 1
good 1
people 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
ll 1
find 1
they 1
have 1
their 1
faults 1
too 1
terry 1
insisted 1
and 1
partly 1
in 1
self 1
defense 1
we 1
all 1
three 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
those 1
faults 1
of 1
theirs 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
very 1
strong 1
on 1
this 1
subject 1
before 1
we 1
got 1
there 1
in 1
those 1
baseless 1
speculations 1
of 1
ours 1
suppose 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
country 1
of 1
women 1
only 1
jeff 1
had 1
put 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
what 1
ll 1
they 1
be 1
like 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
cocksure 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
inevitable 1
limitations 1
the 1
faults 1
and 1
vices 1
of 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
women 1
we 1
had 1
expected 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
over 1
to 1
what 1
we 1
called 1
feminine 1
vanity 1
frills 1
and 1
furbelows 1
and 1
we 1
found 1
they 1
had 1
evolved 1
a 1
costume 1
more 1
perfect 1
than 1
the 1
chinese 1
dress 1
richly 1
beautiful 1
when 1
so 1
desired 1
always 1
useful 1
of 1
unfailing 1
dignity 1
and 1
good 1
taste 1
we 1
had 1
expected 1
a 1
dull 1
submissive 1
monotony 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
daring 1
social 1
inventiveness 1
far 1
beyond 1
our 1
own 1
and 1
a 1
mechanical 1
and 1
scientific 1
development 1
fully 1
equal 1
to 1
ours 1
we 1
had 1
expected 1
pettiness 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
social 1
consciousness 1
besides 1
which 1
our 1
nations 1
looked 1
like 1
quarreling 1
children 1
feebleminded 1
ones 1
at 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
expected 1
jealousy 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
broad 1
sisterly 1
affection 1
a 1
fair 1
minded 1
intelligence 1
to 1
which 1
we 1
could 1
produce 1
no 1
parallel 1
we 1
had 1
expected 1
hysteria 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
standard 1
of 1
health 1
and 1
vigor 1
a 1
calmness 1
of 1
temper 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
profanity 1
for 1
instance 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
explain 1
we 1
tried 1
it 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
even 1
terry 1
had 1
to 1
admit 1
but 1
he 1
still 1
insisted 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
find 1
out 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
pretty 1
soon 1
it 1
stands 1
to 1
reason 1
doesn 1
t 1
it 1
he 1
argued 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
s 1
deuced 1
unnatural 1
i 1
d 1
say 1
impossible 1
if 1
we 1
weren 1
t 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
an 1
unnatural 1
condition 1
s 1
sure 1
to 1
have 1
unnatural 1
results 1
you 1
ll 1
find 1
some 1
awful 1
characteristics 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
for 1
instance 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
yet 1
what 1
they 1
do 1
with 1
their 1
criminals 1
their 1
defectives 1
their 1
aged 1
you 1
notice 1
we 1
haven 1
t 1
seen 1
any 1
there 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
i 1
was 1
inclined 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
so 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
bull 1
by 1
the 1
horns 1
the 1
cow 1
i 1
should 1
say 1
and 1
asked 1
somel 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
find 1
some 1
flaw 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
perfection 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
flatly 1
it 1
simply 1
isn 1
t 1
possible 1
that 1
three 1
million 1
people 1
have 1
no 1
faults 1
we 1
are 1
trying 1
our 1
best 1
to 1
understand 1
and 1
learn 1
would 1
you 1
mind 1
helping 1
us 1
by 1
saying 1
what 1
to 1
your 1
minds 1
are 1
the 1
worst 1
qualities 1
of 1
this 1
unique 1
civilization 1
of 1
yours 1
we 1
were 1
sitting 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
shaded 1
arbor 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
eating 1
gardens 1
of 1
theirs 1
the 1
delicious 1
food 1
had 1
been 1
eaten 1
a 1
plate 1
of 1
fruit 1
still 1
before 1
us 1
we 1
could 1
look 1
out 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
over 1
a 1
stretch 1
of 1
open 1
country 1
quietly 1
rich 1
and 1
lovely 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
the 1
garden 1
with 1
tables 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
far 1
apart 1
enough 1
for 1
privacy 1
let 1
me 1
say 1
right 1
here 1
that 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
careful 1
balance 1
of 1
population 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
crowding 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
there 1
was 1
room 1
space 1
a 1
sunny 1
breezy 1
freedom 1
everywhere 1
somel 1
set 1
her 1
chin 1
upon 1
her 1
hand 1
her 1
elbow 1
on 1
the 1
low 1
wall 1
beside 1
her 1
and 1
looked 1
off 1
over 1
the 1
fair 1
land 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
have 1
faults 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
she 1
said 1
in 1
one 1
way 1
you 1
might 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
more 1
than 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
that 1
is 1
our 1
standard 1
of 1
perfection 1
seems 1
to 1
get 1
farther 1
and 1
farther 1
away 1
but 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
discouraged 1
because 1
our 1
records 1
do 1
show 1
gain 1
considerable 1
gain 1
when 1
we 1
began 1
even 1
with 1
the 1
start 1
of 1
one 1
particularly 1
noble 1
mother 1
we 1
inherited 1
the 1
characteristics 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
race 1
record 1
behind 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
cropped 1
out 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
alarmingly 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
yes 1
quite 1
six 1
hundred 1
years 1
since 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
what 1
you 1
call 1
a 1
criminal 1
we 1
have 1
of 1
course 1
made 1
it 1
our 1
first 1
business 1
to 1
train 1
out 1
to 1
breed 1
out 1
when 1
possible 1
the 1
lowest 1
types 1
breed 1
out 1
i 1
asked 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
with 1
parthenogenesis 1
if 1
the 1
girl 1
showing 1
the 1
bad 1
qualities 1
had 1
still 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
appreciate 1
social 1
duty 1
we 1
appealed 1
to 1
her 1
by 1
that 1
to 1
renounce 1
motherhood 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
few 1
worst 1
types 1
were 1
fortunately 1
unable 1
to 1
reproduce 1
but 1
if 1
the 1
fault 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
disproportionate 1
egotism 1
then 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
sure 1
she 1
had 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
have 1
children 1
even 1
that 1
hers 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
than 1
others 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
said 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
likely 1
to 1
rear 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
spirit 1
that 1
we 1
never 1
allowed 1
answered 1
somel 1
quietly 1
allowed 1
i 1
queried 1
allowed 1
a 1
mother 1
to 1
rear 1
her 1
own 1
children 1
certainly 1
not 1
said 1
somel 1
unless 1
she 1
was 1
fit 1
for 1
that 1
supreme 1
task 1
this 1
was 1
rather 1
a 1
blow 1
to 1
my 1
previous 1
convictions 1
but 1
i 1
thought 1
motherhood 1
was 1
for 1
each 1
of 1
you 1
motherhood 1
yes 1
that 1
is 1
maternity 1
to 1
bear 1
a 1
child 1
but 1
education 1
is 1
our 1
highest 1
art 1
only 1
allowed 1
to 1
our 1
highest 1
artists 1
education 1
i 1
was 1
puzzled 1
again 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
education 1
i 1
mean 1
by 1
motherhood 1
not 1
only 1
child 1
bearing 1
but 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
babies 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
babies 1
involves 1
education 1
and 1
is 1
entrusted 1
only 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
fit 1
she 1
repeated 1
then 1
you 1
separate 1
mother 1
and 1
child 1
i 1
cried 1
in 1
cold 1
horror 1
something 1
of 1
terry 1
s 1
feeling 1
creeping 1
over 1
me 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
something 1
wrong 1
among 1
these 1
many 1
virtues 1
not 1
usually 1
she 1
patiently 1
explained 1
you 1
see 1
almost 1
every 1
woman 1
values 1
her 1
maternity 1
above 1
everything 1
else 1
each 1
girl 1
holds 1
it 1
close 1
and 1
dear 1
an 1
exquisite 1
joy 1
a 1
crowning 1
honor 1
the 1
most 1
intimate 1
most 1
personal 1
most 1
precious 1
thing 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
child 1
rearing 1
has 1
come 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
us 1
a 1
culture 1
so 1
profoundly 1
studied 1
practiced 1
with 1
such 1
subtlety 1
and 1
skill 1
that 1
the 1
more 1
we 1
love 1
our 1
children 1
the 1
less 1
we 1
are 1
willing 1
to 1
trust 1
that 1
process 1
to 1
unskilled 1
hands 1
even 1
our 1
own 1
but 1
a 1
mother 1
s 1
love 1
i 1
ventured 1
she 1
studied 1
my 1
face 1
trying 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
a 1
means 1
of 1
clear 1
explanation 1
you 1
told 1
us 1
about 1
your 1
dentists 1
she 1
said 1
at 1
length 1
those 1
quaintly 1
specialized 1
persons 1
who 1
spend 1
their 1
lives 1
filling 1
little 1
holes 1
in 1
other 1
persons 1
teeth 1
even 1
in 1
children 1
s 1
teeth 1
sometimes 1
yes 1
i 1
said 1
not 1
getting 1
her 1
drift 1
does 1
mother 1
love 1
urge 1
mothers 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
fill 1
their 1
own 1
children 1
s 1
teeth 1
or 1
to 1
wish 1
to 1
why 1
no 1
of 1
course 1
not 1
i 1
protested 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
highly 1
specialized 1
craft 1
surely 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
babies 1
is 1
open 1
to 1
any 1
woman 1
any 1
mother 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
so 1
she 1
gently 1
replied 1
those 1
of 1
us 1
who 1
are 1
the 1
most 1
highly 1
competent 1
fulfill 1
that 1
office 1
and 1
a 1
majority 1
of 1
our 1
girls 1
eagerly 1
try 1
for 1
it 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
we 1
have 1
the 1
very 1
best 1
but 1
the 1
poor 1
mother 1
bereaved 1
of 1
her 1
baby 1
oh 1
no 1
she 1
earnestly 1
assured 1
me 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
bereaved 1
it 1
is 1
her 1
baby 1
still 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
her 1
she 1
has 1
not 1
lost 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
it 1
there 1
are 1
others 1
whom 1
she 1
knows 1
to 1
be 1
wiser 1
she 1
knows 1
it 1
because 1
she 1
has 1
studied 1
as 1
they 1
did 1
practiced 1
as 1
they 1
did 1
and 1
honors 1
their 1
real 1
superiority 1
for 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
sake 1
she 1
is 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
for 1
it 1
this 1
highest 1
care 1
i 1
was 1
unconvinced 1
besides 1
this 1
was 1
only 1
hearsay 1
i 1
had 1
yet 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
motherhood 1
of 1
herland 1
chapter 1
8 1
the 1
girls 1
of 1
herland 1
at 1
last 1
terry 1
s 1
ambition 1
was 1
realized 1
we 1
were 1
invited 1
always 1
courteously 1
and 1
with 1
free 1
choice 1
on 1
our 1
part 1
to 1
address 1
general 1
audiences 1
and 1
classes 1
of 1
girls 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
and 1
how 1
careful 1
we 1
were 1
about 1
our 1
clothes 1
and 1
our 1
amateur 1
barbering 1
terry 1
in 1
particular 1
was 1
fussy 1
to 1
a 1
degree 1
about 1
the 1
cut 1
of 1
his 1
beard 1
and 1
so 1
critical 1
of 1
our 1
combined 1
efforts 1
that 1
we 1
handed 1
him 1
the 1
shears 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
please 1
himself 1
we 1
began 1
to 1
rather 1
prize 1
those 1
beards 1
of 1
ours 1
they 1
were 1
almost 1
our 1
sole 1
distinction 1
among 1
those 1
tall 1
and 1
sturdy 1
women 1
with 1
their 1
cropped 1
hair 1
and 1
sexless 1
costume 1
being 1
offered 1
a 1
wide 1
selection 1
of 1
garments 1
we 1
had 1
chosen 1
according 1
to 1
our 1
personal 1
taste 1
and 1
were 1
surprised 1
to 1
find 1
on 1
meeting 1
large 1
audiences 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
the 1
most 1
highly 1
decorated 1
especially 1
terry 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
impressive 1
figure 1
his 1
strong 1
features 1
softened 1
by 1
the 1
somewhat 1
longer 1
hair 1
though 1
he 1
made 1
me 1
trim 1
it 1
as 1
closely 1
as 1
i 1
knew 1
how 1
and 1
he 1
wore 1
his 1
richly 1
embroidered 1
tunic 1
with 1
its 1
broad 1
loose 1
girdle 1
with 1
quite 1
a 1
henry 1
v 1
air 1
jeff 1
looked 1
more 1
like 1
well 1
like 1
a 1
huguenot 1
lover 1
and 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
looked 1
like 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
very 1
comfortable 1
when 1
i 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
own 1
padded 1
armor 1
and 1
its 1
starched 1
borders 1
i 1
realized 1
with 1
acute 1
regret 1
how 1
comfortable 1
were 1
those 1
herland 1
clothes 1
we 1
scanned 1
that 1
audience 1
looking 1
for 1
the 1
three 1
bright 1
faces 1
we 1
knew 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
just 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
girls 1
quiet 1
eager 1
watchful 1
all 1
eyes 1
and 1
ears 1
to 1
listen 1
and 1
learn 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
urged 1
to 1
give 1
as 1
fully 1
as 1
we 1

synopsis 1

history 1
in 1
brief 1
and 1
to 1
answer 1
questions 1
we 1
are 1
so 1
utterly 1
ignorant 1
you 1
see 1
moadine 1
had 1
explained 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
know 1
nothing 1
but 1
such 1
science 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
worked 1
out 1
for 1
ourselves 1
just 1
the 1
brain 1
work 1
of 1
one 1
small 1
half 1
country 1

you 1

how 1
wonderful 1
how 1
supremely 1
beautiful 1
your 1
civilization 1
must 1
be 1
somel 1
gave 1
a 1
further 1
suggestion 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
have 1
to 1
begin 1
all 1
over 1
again 1
as 1
you 1
did 1
with 1
us 1
we 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
digest 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
have 1
learned 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
eagerly 1
absorbed 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
country 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
our 1
outline 1
we 1
were 1
eager 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
and 1
deeply 1
impressed 1
to 1
us 1
at 1
first 1
these 1
women 1
unavoidably 1
ignorant 1
of 1
what 1
to 1
us 1
was 1
the 1
basic 1
commonplace 1
of 1
knowledge 1
had 1
seemed 1
on 1
the 1
plane 1
of 1
children 1
or 1
of 1
savages 1
what 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
to 1
admit 1
with 1
growing 1
acquaintance 1
was 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
ignorant 1
as 1
plato 1
and 1
aristotle 1
were 1
but 1
with 1
a 1
highly 1
developed 1
mentality 1
quite 1
comparable 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
ancient 1
greece 1
far 1
be 1
it 1
from 1
me 1
to 1
lumber 1
these 1
pages 1
with 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
so 1
imperfectly 1
strove 1
to 1
teach 1
them 1
the 1
memorable 1
fact 1
is 1
what 1
they 1
taught 1
us 1
or 1
some 1
faint 1
glimpse 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
present 1
our 1
major 1
interest 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
subject 1
matter 1
of 1
our 1
talk 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
audience 1
girls 1
hundreds 1
of 1
them 1
eager 1
bright 1
eyed 1
attentive 1
young 1
faces 1
crowding 1
questions 1
and 1
i 1
regret 1
to 1
say 1
an 1
increasing 1
inability 1
on 1
our 1
part 1
to 1
answer 1
them 1
effectively 1
our 1
special 1
guides 1
who 1
were 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
sometimes 1
aided 1
in 1
clarifying 1
a 1
question 1
or 1
oftener 1
an 1
answer 1
noticed 1
this 1
effect 1
and 1
closed 1
the 1
formal 1
lecture 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
rather 1
shortly 1
our 1
young 1
women 1
will 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
meet 1
you 1
somel 1
suggested 1
to 1
talk 1
with 1
you 1
more 1
personally 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
willing 1
willing 1
we 1
were 1
impatient 1
and 1
said 1
as 1
much 1
at 1
which 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
flickering 1
little 1
smile 1
cross 1
moadine 1
s 1
face 1
even 1
then 1
with 1
all 1
those 1
eager 1
young 1
things 1
waiting 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
us 1
a 1
sudden 1
question 1
crossed 1
my 1
mind 1
what 1
was 1
their 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
what 1
did 1
they 1
think 1
of 1
us 1
we 1
learned 1
that 1
later 1
terry 1
plunged 1
in 1
among 1
those 1
young 1
creatures 1
with 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
rapture 1
somewhat 1
as 1
a 1
glad 1
swimmer 1
takes 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
jeff 1
with 1
a 1
rapt 1
look 1
on 1
his 1
high 1
bred 1
face 1
approached 1
as 1
to 1
a 1
sacrament 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
chilled 1
by 1
that 1
last 1
thought 1
of 1
mine 1
and 1
kept 1
my 1
eyes 1
open 1
i 1
found 1
time 1
to 1
watch 1
jeff 1
even 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
surrounded 1
by 1
an 1
eager 1
group 1
of 1
questioners 1
as 1
we 1
all 1
were 1
and 1
saw 1
how 1
his 1
worshipping 1
eyes 1
his 1
grave 1
courtesy 1
pleased 1
and 1
drew 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
while 1
others 1
rather 1
stronger 1
spirits 1
they 1
looked 1
to 1
be 1
drew 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
group 1
to 1
terry 1
s 1
or 1
mine 1
i 1
watched 1
terry 1
with 1
special 1
interest 1
knowing 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
longed 1
for 1
this 1
time 1
and 1
how 1
irresistible 1
he 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
just 1
in 1
snatches 1
of 1
course 1
how 1
his 1
suave 1
and 1
masterful 1
approach 1
seemed 1
to 1
irritate 1
them 1
his 1
too 1
intimate 1
glances 1
were 1
vaguely 1
resented 1
his 1
compliments 1
puzzled 1
and 1
annoyed 1
sometimes 1
a 1
girl 1
would 1
flush 1
not 1
with 1
drooped 1
eyelids 1
and 1
inviting 1
timidity 1
but 1
with 1
anger 1
and 1
a 1
quick 1
lift 1
of 1
the 1
head 1
girl 1
after 1
girl 1
turned 1
on 1
her 1
heel 1
and 1
left 1
him 1
till 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
ring 1
of 1
questioners 1
and 1
they 1
visibly 1
were 1
the 1
least 1
girlish 1
of 1
the 1
lot 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
looking 1
pleased 1
at 1
first 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
making 1
a 1
strong 1
impression 1
but 1
finally 1
casting 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
jeff 1
or 1
me 1
he 1
seemed 1
less 1
pleased 1
and 1
less 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
most 1
agreeably 1
surprised 1
at 1
home 1
i 1
never 1
was 1
popular 1
i 1
had 1
my 1
girl 1
friends 1
good 1
ones 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
friends 1
nothing 1
else 1
also 1
they 1
were 1
of 1
somewhat 1
the 1
same 1
clan 1
not 1
popular 1
in 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
swarming 1
admirers 1
but 1
here 1
to 1
my 1
astonishment 1
i 1
found 1
my 1
crowd 1
was 1
the 1
largest 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
generalize 1
of 1
course 1
rather 1
telescoping 1
many 1
impressions 1
but 1
the 1
first 1
evening 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
sample 1
of 1
the 1
impression 1
we 1
made 1
jeff 1
had 1
a 1
following 1
if 1
i 1
may 1
call 1
it 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
more 1
sentimental 1
though 1
that 1
s 1
not 1
the 1
word 1
i 1
want 1
the 1
less 1
practical 1
perhaps 1
the 1
girls 1
who 1
were 1
artists 1
of 1
some 1
sort 1
ethicists 1
teachers 1
that 1
kind 1
terry 1
was 1
reduced 1
to 1
a 1
rather 1
combative 1
group 1
keen 1
logical 1
inquiring 1
minds 1
not 1
overly 1
sensitive 1
the 1
very 1
kind 1
he 1
liked 1
least 1
while 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
became 1
quite 1
cocky 1
over 1
my 1
general 1
popularity 1
terry 1
was 1
furious 1
about 1
it 1
we 1
could 1
hardly 1
blame 1
him 1
girls 1
he 1
burst 1
forth 1
when 1
that 1
evening 1
was 1
over 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
by 1
ourselves 1
once 1
more 1
call 1
those 1
girls 1
most 1
delightful 1
girls 1
i 1
call 1
them 1
said 1
jeff 1
his 1
blue 1
eyes 1
dreamily 1
contented 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
call 1
them 1
i 1
mildly 1
inquired 1
boys 1
nothing 1
but 1
boys 1
most 1
of 1
em 1
a 1
standoffish 1
disagreeable 1
lot 1
at 1
that 1
critical 1
impertinent 1
youngsters 1
no 1
girls 1
at 1
all 1
he 1
was 1
angry 1
and 1
severe 1
not 1
a 1
little 1
jealous 1
too 1
i 1
think 1
afterward 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
out 1
just 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
he 1
changed 1
his 1
manner 1
somewhat 1
and 1
got 1
on 1
better 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
for 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
his 1
criticism 1
they 1
were 1
girls 1
and 1
furthermore 1
all 1
the 1
girls 1
there 1
were 1
always 1
excepting 1
our 1
three 1
with 1
whom 1
we 1
presently 1
renewed 1
our 1
acquaintance 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
courtship 1
which 1
it 1
soon 1
did 1
i 1
can 1
of 1
course 1
best 1
describe 1
my 1
own 1
and 1
am 1
least 1
inclined 1
to 1
but 1
of 1
jeff 1
i 1
heard 1
somewhat 1
he 1
was 1
inclined 1
to 1
dwell 1
reverently 1
and 1
admiringly 1
at 1
some 1
length 1
on 1
the 1
exalted 1
sentiment 1
and 1
measureless 1
perfection 1
of 1
his 1
celis 1
and 1
terry 1
terry 1
made 1
so 1
many 1
false 1
starts 1
and 1
met 1
so 1
many 1
rebuffs 1
that 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
really 1
settled 1
down 1
to 1
win 1
alima 1
he 1
was 1
considerably 1
wiser 1
at 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
smooth 1
sailing 1
they 1
broke 1
and 1
quarreled 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
he 1
would 1
rush 1
off 1
to 1
console 1
himself 1
with 1
some 1
other 1
fair 1
one 1
the 1
other 1
fair 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
none 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
drift 1
back 1
to 1
alima 1
becoming 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
devoted 1
each 1
time 1
she 1
never 1
gave 1
an 1
inch 1
a 1
big 1
handsome 1
creature 1
rather 1
exceptionally 1
strong 1
even 1
in 1
that 1
race 1
of 1
strong 1
women 1
with 1
a 1
proud 1
head 1
and 1
sweeping 1
level 1
brows 1
that 1
lined 1
across 1
above 1
her 1
dark 1
eager 1
eyes 1
like 1
the 1
wide 1
wings 1
of 1
a 1
soaring 1
hawk 1
i 1
was 1
good 1
friends 1
with 1
all 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
with 1
ellador 1
long 1
before 1
that 1
feeling 1
changed 1
for 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
from 1
somel 1
who 1
talked 1
very 1
freely 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
learned 1
at 1
last 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
viewpoint 1
of 1
herland 1
toward 1
its 1
visitors 1
here 1
they 1
were 1
isolated 1
happy 1
contented 1
when 1
the 1
booming 1
buzz 1
of 1
our 1
biplane 1
tore 1
the 1
air 1
above 1
them 1
everybody 1
heard 1
it 1
saw 1
it 1
for 1
miles 1
and 1
miles 1
word 1
flashed 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
a 1
council 1
was 1
held 1
in 1
every 1
town 1
and 1
village 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
their 1
rapid 1
determination 1
from 1
another 1
country 1
probably 1
men 1
evidently 1
highly 1
civilized 1
doubtless 1
possessed 1
of 1
much 1
valuable 1
knowledge 1
may 1
be 1
dangerous 1
catch 1
them 1
if 1
possible 1
tame 1
and 1
train 1
them 1
if 1
necessary 1
this 1
may 1
be 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
re 1
establish 1
a 1
bi 1
sexual 1
state 1
for 1
our 1
people 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
us 1
three 1
million 1
highly 1
intelligent 1
women 1
or 1
two 1
million 1
counting 1
only 1
grown 1
ups 1
were 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
three 1
young 1
men 1
we 1
thought 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
women 1
and 1
therefore 1
timid 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
since 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
anything 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
and 1
certainly 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
thousand 1
since 1
they 1
had 1
outgrown 1
the 1
feeling 1
we 1
thought 1
at 1
least 1
terry 1
did 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
have 1
our 1
pick 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
thought 1
very 1
cautiously 1
and 1
farsightedly 1
of 1
picking 1
us 1
if 1
it 1
seemed 1
wise 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
training 1
they 1
studied 1
us 1
analyzed 1
us 1
prepared 1
reports 1
about 1
us 1
and 1
this 1
information 1
was 1
widely 1
disseminated 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
land 1
not 1
a 1
girl 1
in 1
that 1
country 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
learning 1
for 1
months 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
could 1
be 1
gathered 1
about 1
our 1
country 1
our 1
culture 1
our 1
personal 1
characters 1
no 1
wonder 1
their 1
questions 1
were 1
hard 1
to 1
answer 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
say 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
at 1
last 1
brought 1
out 1
and 1
exhibited 1
i 1
hate 1
to 1
call 1
it 1
that 1
but 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
rush 1
of 1
takers 1
here 1
was 1
poor 1
old 1
terry 1
fondly 1
imagining 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
free 1
to 1
stray 1
in 1
a 1
rosebud 1
garden 1
of 1
girls 1
and 1
behold 1
the 1
rosebuds 1
were 1
all 1
with 1
keen 1
appraising 1
eye 1
studying 1
us 1
they 1
were 1
interested 1
profoundly 1
interested 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
interest 1
we 1
were 1
looking 1
for 1
to 1
get 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
their 1
attitude 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
hold 1
in 1
mind 1
their 1
extremely 1
high 1
sense 1
of 1
solidarity 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
each 1
choosing 1
a 1
lover 1
they 1
hadn 1
t 1
the 1
faintest 1
idea 1
of 1
love 1
sex 1
love 1
that 1
is 1
these 1
girls 1
to 1
each 1
of 1
whom 1
motherhood 1
was 1
a 1
lodestar 1
and 1
that 1
motherhood 1
exalted 1
above 1
a 1
mere 1
personal 1
function 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
as 1
the 1
highest 1
social 1
service 1
as 1
the 1
sacrament 1
of 1
a 1
lifetime 1
were 1
now 1
confronted 1
with 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
great 1
step 1
of 1
changing 1
their 1
whole 1
status 1
of 1
reverting 1
to 1
their 1
earlier 1
bi 1
sexual 1
order 1
of 1
nature 1
beside 1
this 1
underlying 1
consideration 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
limitless 1
interest 1
and 1
curiosity 1
in 1
our 1
civilization 1
purely 1
impersonal 1
and 1
held 1
by 1
an 1
order 1
of 1
mind 1
beside 1
which 1
we 1
were 1
like 1
schoolboys 1
it 1
was 1
small 1
wonder 1
that 1
our 1
lectures 1
were 1
not 1
a 1
success 1
and 1
none 1
at 1
all 1
that 1
our 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
terry 1
s 1
advances 1
were 1
so 1
ill 1
received 1
the 1
reason 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
comparative 1
success 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
far 1
from 1
pleasing 1
to 1
my 1
pride 1
we 1
like 1
you 1
the 1
best 1
somel 1
told 1
me 1
because 1
you 1
seem 1
more 1
like 1
us 1
more 1
like 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
women 1
i 1
thought 1
to 1
myself 1
disgustedly 1
and 1
then 1
remembered 1
how 1
little 1
like 1
women 1
in 1
our 1
derogatory 1
sense 1
they 1
were 1
she 1
was 1
smiling 1
at 1
me 1
reading 1
my 1
thought 1
we 1
can 1
quite 1
see 1
that 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
seem 1
like 1
women 1
to 1
you 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
a 1
bi 1
sexual 1
race 1
the 1
distinctive 1
feature 1
of 1
each 1
sex 1
must 1
be 1
intensified 1
but 1
surely 1
there 1
are 1
characteristics 1
enough 1
which 1
belong 1
to 1
people 1
aren 1
t 1
there 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
i 1
mean 1
about 1
you 1
being 1
more 1
like 1
us 1
more 1
like 1
people 1
we 1
feel 1
at 1
ease 1
with 1
you 1
jeff 1
s 1
difficulty 1
was 1
his 1
exalted 1
gallantry 1
he 1
idealized 1
women 1
and 1
was 1
always 1
looking 1
for 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
protect 1
or 1
to 1
serve 1
them 1
these 1
needed 1
neither 1
protection 1
nor 1
service 1
they 1
were 1
living 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
power 1
and 1
plenty 1
we 1
were 1
their 1
guests 1
their 1
prisoners 1
absolutely 1
dependent 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
could 1
promise 1
whatsoever 1
we 1
might 1
of 1
advantages 1
if 1
they 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
our 1
country 1
but 1
the 1
more 1
we 1
knew 1
of 1
theirs 1
the 1
less 1
we 1
boasted 1
terry 1
s 1
jewels 1
and 1
trinkets 1
they 1
prized 1
as 1
curios 1
handed 1
them 1
about 1
asking 1
questions 1
as 1
to 1
workmanship 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
as 1
to 1
value 1
and 1
discussed 1
not 1
ownership 1
but 1
which 1
museum 1
to 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
give 1
a 1
woman 1
is 1
dependent 1
wholly 1
on 1
his 1
personal 1
attraction 1
his 1
courtship 1
is 1
under 1
limitations 1
they 1
were 1
considering 1
these 1
two 1
things 1
the 1
advisability 1
of 1
making 1
the 1
great 1
change 1
and 1
the 1
degree 1
of 1
personal 1
adaptability 1
which 1
would 1
best 1
serve 1
that 1
end 1
here 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
our 1
small 1
personal 1
experience 1
with 1
those 1
three 1
fleet 1
forest 1
girls 1
and 1
that 1
served 1
to 1
draw 1
us 1
together 1
as 1
for 1
ellador 1
suppose 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
strange 1
land 1
and 1
find 1
it 1
pleasant 1
enough 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
ordinarily 1
pleasant 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
find 1
rich 1
farmland 1
and 1
then 1
gardens 1
gorgeous 1
gardens 1
and 1
then 1
palaces 1
full 1
of 1
rare 1
and 1
curious 1
treasures 1
incalculable 1
inexhaustible 1
and 1
then 1
mountains 1
like 1
the 1
himalayas 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
sea 1
i 1
liked 1
her 1
that 1
day 1
she 1
balanced 1
on 1
the 1
branch 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
named 1
the 1
trio 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
most 1
afterward 1
i 1
turned 1
to 1
her 1
like 1
a 1
friend 1
when 1
we 1
met 1
for 1
the 1
third 1
time 1
and 1
continued 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
while 1
jeff 1
s 1
ultra 1
devotion 1
rather 1
puzzled 1
celis 1
really 1
put 1
off 1
their 1
day 1
of 1
happiness 1
while 1
terry 1
and 1
alima 1
quarreled 1
and 1
parted 1
re 1
met 1
and 1
re 1
parted 1
ellador 1
and 1
i 1
grew 1
to 1
be 1
close 1
friends 1
we 1
talked 1
and 1
talked 1
we 1
took 1
long 1
walks 1
together 1
she 1
showed 1
me 1
things 1
explained 1
them 1
interpreted 1
much 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
understood 1
through 1
her 1
sympathetic 1
intelligence 1
i 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
comprehending 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
herland 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
appreciative 1
of 1
its 1
marvelous 1
inner 1
growth 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
outer 1
perfection 1
i 1
ceased 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
stranger 1
a 1
prisoner 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
understanding 1
of 1
identity 1
of 1
purpose 1
we 1
discussed 1
everything 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
traveled 1
farther 1
and 1
farther 1
exploring 1
the 1
rich 1
sweet 1
soul 1
of 1
her 1
my 1
sense 1
of 1
pleasant 1
friendship 1
became 1
but 1
a 1
broad 1
foundation 1
for 1
such 1
height 1
such 1
breadth 1
such 1
interlocked 1
combination 1
of 1
feeling 1
as 1
left 1
me 1
fairly 1
blinded 1
with 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
ve 1
said 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
cared 1
very 1
much 1
for 1
women 1
nor 1
they 1
for 1
me 1
not 1
terry 1
fashion 1
but 1
this 1
one 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
never 1
even 1
thought 1
of 1
her 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
as 1
the 1
girls 1
have 1
it 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
with 1
any 1
turkish 1
harem 1
intentions 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
no 1
woman 1
worshipper 1
like 1
jeff 1
i 1
just 1
liked 1
that 1
girl 1
as 1
a 1
friend 1
as 1
we 1
say 1
that 1
friendship 1
grew 1
like 1
a 1
tree 1
she 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
good 1
sport 1
we 1
did 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
things 1
together 1
she 1
taught 1
me 1
games 1
and 1
i 1
taught 1
her 1
games 1
and 1
we 1
raced 1
and 1
rowed 1
and 1
had 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
fun 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
higher 1
comradeship 1
then 1
as 1
i 1
got 1
on 1
farther 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
treasures 1
and 1
snowy 1
mountain 1
ranges 1
opened 1
up 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
known 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
such 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
so 1
great 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
talented 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
forester 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
that 1
gift 1
i 1
mean 1
when 1
i 1
say 1
great 1
i 1
mean 1
great 1
big 1
all 1
through 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
known 1
more 1
of 1
those 1
women 1
as 1
intimately 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
found 1
her 1
so 1
unique 1
but 1
even 1
among 1
them 1
she 1
was 1
noble 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
an 1
over 1
mother 1
and 1
her 1
grandmother 1
too 1
i 1
heard 1
later 1
so 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
of 1
her 1
beautiful 1
land 1
and 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
as 1
much 1
yes 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
about 1
mine 1
and 1
we 1
became 1
inseparable 1
then 1
this 1
deeper 1
recognition 1
came 1
and 1
grew 1
i 1
felt 1
my 1
own 1
soul 1
rise 1
and 1
lift 1
its 1
wings 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
life 1
got 1
bigger 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
understood 1
as 1
i 1
never 1
had 1
before 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
things 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
too 1
could 1
grow 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
help 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
a 1
still 1
day 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
their 1
world 1
the 1
two 1
of 1
us 1
gazing 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
far 1
dim 1
forestland 1
below 1
talking 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
earth 1
and 1
human 1
life 1
and 1
of 1
my 1
land 1
and 1
other 1
lands 1
and 1
what 1
they 1
needed 1
and 1
what 1
i 1
hoped 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
them 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
help 1
me 1
i 1
said 1
she 1
turned 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
that 1
high 1
sweet 1
look 1
of 1
hers 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
her 1
eyes 1
rested 1
in 1
mine 1
and 1
her 1
hands 1
too 1
then 1
suddenly 1
there 1
blazed 1
out 1
between 1
us 1
a 1
farther 1
glory 1
instant 1
overwhelming 1
quite 1
beyond 1
any 1
words 1
of 1
mine 1
to 1
tell 1
celis 1
was 1
a 1
blue 1
and 1
gold 1
and 1
rose 1
person 1
alma 1
black 1
and 1
white 1
and 1
red 1
a 1
blazing 1
beauty 1
ellador 1
was 1
brown 1
hair 1
dark 1
and 1
soft 1
like 1
a 1
seal 1
coat 1
clear 1
brown 1
skin 1
with 1
a 1
healthy 1
red 1
in 1
it 1
brown 1
eyes 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
from 1
topaz 1
to 1
black 1
velvet 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
range 1
splendid 1
girls 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
us 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
far 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
lake 1
below 1
and 1
flashed 1
the 1
tidings 1
across 1
the 1
land 1
even 1
before 1
our 1
first 1
exploring 1
flight 1
they 1
had 1
watched 1
our 1
landing 1
flitted 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
with 1
us 1
hidden 1
in 1
that 1
tree 1
and 1
i 1
shrewdly 1
suspect 1
giggled 1
on 1
purpose 1
they 1
had 1
kept 1
watch 1
over 1
our 1
hooded 1
machine 1
taking 1
turns 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
our 1
escape 1
was 1
announced 1
had 1
followed 1
along 1
side 1
for 1
a 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
been 1
there 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
as 1
described 1
they 1
felt 1
a 1
special 1
claim 1
on 1
us 1
called 1
us 1
their 1
men 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
at 1
liberty 1
to 1
study 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
people 1
and 1
be 1
studied 1
by 1
them 1
their 1
claim 1
was 1
recognized 1
by 1
the 1
wise 1
leaders 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
we 1
all 1
did 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
chosen 1
them 1
among 1
millions 1
unerringly 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
true 1
love 1
never 1
did 1
run 1
smooth 1
this 1
period 1
of 1
courtship 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
unsuspected 1
pitfalls 1
writing 1
this 1
as 1
late 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
after 1
manifold 1
experiences 1
both 1
in 1
herland 1
and 1
later 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
land 1
i 1
can 1
now 1
understand 1
and 1
philosophize 1
about 1
what 1
was 1
then 1
a 1
continual 1
astonishment 1
and 1
often 1
a 1
temporary 1
tragedy 1
the 1
long 1
suit 1
in 1
most 1
courtships 1
is 1
sex 1
attraction 1
of 1
course 1
then 1
gradually 1
develops 1
such 1
comradeship 1
as 1
the 1
two 1
temperaments 1
allow 1
then 1
after 1
marriage 1
there 1
is 1
either 1
the 1
establishment 1
of 1
a 1
slow 1
growing 1
widely 1
based 1
friendship 1
the 1
deepest 1
tenderest 1
sweetest 1
of 1
relations 1
all 1
lit 1
and 1
warmed 1
by 1
the 1
recurrent 1
flame 1
of 1
love 1
or 1
else 1
that 1
process 1
is 1
reversed 1
love 1
cools 1
and 1
fades 1
no 1
friendship 1
grows 1
the 1
whole 1
relation 1
turns 1
from 1
beauty 1
to 1
ashes 1
here 1
everything 1
was 1
different 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sex 1
feeling 1
to 1
appeal 1
to 1
or 1
practically 1
none 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
disuse 1
had 1
left 1
very 1
little 1
of 1
the 1
instinct 1
also 1
we 1
must 1
remember 1
that 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
at 1
times 1
manifested 1
it 1
as 1
atavistic 1
exceptions 1
were 1
often 1
by 1
that 1
very 1
fact 1
denied 1
motherhood 1
yet 1
while 1
the 1
mother 1
process 1
remains 1
the 1
inherent 1
ground 1
for 1
sex 1
distinction 1
remains 1
also 1
and 1
who 1
shall 1
say 1
what 1
long 1
forgotten 1
feeling 1
vague 1
and 1
nameless 1
was 1
stirred 1
in 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
mother 1
hearts 1
by 1
our 1
arrival 1
what 1
left 1
us 1
even 1
more 1
at 1
sea 1
in 1
our 1
approach 1
was 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
any 1
sex 1
tradition 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
accepted 1
standard 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
manly 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
womanly 1
when 1
jeff 1
said 1
taking 1
the 1
fruit 1
basket 1
from 1
his 1
adored 1
one 1
a 1
woman 1
should 1
not 1
carry 1
anything 1
celis 1
said 1
why 1
with 1
the 1
frankest 1
amazement 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
look 1
that 1
fleet 1
footed 1
deep 1
chested 1
young 1
forester 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
and 1
say 1
because 1
she 1
is 1
weaker 1
she 1
wasn 1
t 1
one 1
does 1
not 1
call 1
a 1
race 1
horse 1
weak 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
visibly 1
not 1
a 1
cart 1
horse 1
he 1
said 1
rather 1
lamely 1
that 1
women 1
were 1
not 1
built 1
for 1
heavy 1
work 1
she 1
looked 1
out 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
to 1
where 1
some 1
women 1
were 1
working 1
building 1
a 1
new 1
bit 1
of 1
wall 1
out 1
of 1
large 1
stones 1
looked 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
nearest 1
town 1
with 1
its 1
woman 1
built 1
houses 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
smooth 1
hard 1
road 1
we 1
were 1
walking 1
on 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
the 1
little 1
basket 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
from 1
her 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
understand 1
she 1
said 1
quite 1
sweetly 1
are 1
the 1
women 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
so 1
weak 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
carry 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
convention 1
he 1
said 1
we 1
assume 1
that 1
motherhood 1
is 1
a 1
sufficient 1
burden 1
that 1
men 1
should 1
carry 1
all 1
the 1
others 1
what 1
a 1
beautiful 1
feeling 1
she 1
said 1
her 1
blue 1
eyes 1
shining 1
does 1
it 1
work 1
asked 1
alima 1
in 1
her 1
keen 1
swift 1
way 1
do 1
all 1
men 1
in 1
all 1
countries 1
carry 1
everything 1
or 1
is 1
it 1
only 1
in 1
yours 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
so 1
literal 1
terry 1
begged 1
lazily 1
why 1
aren 1
t 1
you 1
willing 1
to 1
be 1
worshipped 1
and 1
waited 1
on 1
we 1
like 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
us 1
do 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
she 1
answered 1
that 1
s 1
different 1
he 1
said 1
annoyed 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
said 1
why 1
is 1
it 1
he 1
quite 1
sulked 1
referring 1
her 1
to 1
me 1
saying 1
van 1
s 1
the 1
philosopher 1
ellador 1
and 1
i 1
talked 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
together 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
an 1
easier 1
experience 1
of 1
it 1
when 1
the 1
real 1
miracle 1
time 1
came 1
also 1
between 1
us 1
we 1
made 1
things 1
clearer 1
to 1
jeff 1
and 1
celis 1
but 1
terry 1
would 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
reason 1
he 1
was 1
madly 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
alima 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
by 1
storm 1
and 1
nearly 1
lost 1
her 1
forever 1
you 1
see 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
loves 1
a 1
girl 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
young 1
and 1
inexperienced 1
who 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
place 1
is 1
educated 1
with 1
a 1
background 1
of 1
caveman 1
tradition 1
a 1
middle 1
ground 1
of 1
poetry 1
and 1
romance 1
and 1
a 1
foreground 1
of 1
unspoken 1
hope 1
and 1
interest 1
all 1
centering 1
upon 1
the 1
one 1
event 1
and 1
who 1
has 1
furthermore 1
absolutely 1
no 1
other 1
hope 1
or 1
interest 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
why 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
comparatively 1
easy 1
matter 1
to 1
sweep 1
her 1
off 1
her 1
feet 1
with 1
a 1
dashing 1
attack 1
terry 1
was 1
a 1
past 1
master 1
in 1
this 1
process 1
he 1
tried 1
it 1
here 1
and 1
alima 1
was 1
so 1
affronted 1
so 1
repelled 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
weeks 1
before 1
he 1
got 1
near 1
enough 1
to 1
try 1
again 1
the 1
more 1
coldly 1
she 1
denied 1
him 1
the 1
hotter 1
his 1
determination 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
used 1
to 1
real 1
refusal 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
flattery 1
she 1
dismissed 1
with 1
laughter 1
gifts 1
and 1
such 1
attentions 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
bring 1
to 1
bear 1
pathos 1
and 1
complaint 1
of 1
cruelty 1
stirred 1
only 1
a 1
reasoning 1
inquiry 1
it 1
took 1
terry 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
doubt 1
if 1
she 1
ever 1
accepted 1
her 1
strange 1
lover 1
as 1
fully 1
as 1
did 1
celis 1
and 1
ellador 1
theirs 1
he 1
had 1
hurt 1
and 1
offended 1
her 1
too 1
often 1
there 1
were 1
reservations 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
alima 1
retained 1
some 1
faint 1
vestige 1
of 1
long 1
descended 1
feeling 1
which 1
made 1
terry 1
more 1
possible 1
to 1
her 1
than 1
to 1
others 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
to 1
the 1
experiment 1
and 1
hated 1
to 1
renounce 1
it 1
however 1
it 1
came 1
about 1
we 1
all 1
three 1
at 1
length 1
achieved 1
full 1
understanding 1
and 1
solemnly 1
faced 1
what 1
was 1
to 1
them 1
a 1
step 1
of 1
measureless 1
importance 1
a 1
grave 1
question 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
great 1
happiness 1
to 1
us 1
a 1
strange 1
new 1
joy 1
of 1
marriage 1
as 1
a 1
ceremony 1
they 1
knew 1
nothing 1
jeff 1
was 1
for 1
bringing 1
them 1
to 1
our 1
country 1
for 1
the 1
religious 1
and 1
the 1
civil 1
ceremony 1
but 1
neither 1
celis 1
nor 1
the 1
others 1
would 1
consent 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
expect 1
them 1
to 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
us 1
yet 1
said 1
terry 1
sagely 1
wait 1
a 1
bit 1
boys 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
take 1
em 1
on 1
their 1
own 1
terms 1
if 1
at 1
all 1
this 1
in 1
rueful 1
reminiscence 1
of 1
his 1
repeated 1
failures 1
but 1
our 1
time 1
s 1
coming 1
he 1
added 1
cheerfully 1
these 1
women 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
mastered 1
you 1
see 1
this 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
discovery 1
you 1
d 1
better 1
not 1
try 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
mastering 1
if 1
you 1
value 1
your 1
chances 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
seriously 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
laughed 1
and 1
said 1
every 1
man 1
to 1
his 1
trade 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
do 1
anything 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
own 1
medicine 1
if 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
tradition 1
of 1
courtship 1
left 1
us 1
much 1
at 1
sea 1
in 1
our 1
wooing 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
still 1
more 1
bewildered 1
by 1
lack 1
of 1
tradition 1
of 1
matrimony 1
and 1
here 1
again 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
draw 1
on 1
later 1
experience 1
and 1
as 1
deep 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
with 1
their 1
culture 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
achieve 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
gulfs 1
of 1
difference 1
between 1
us 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
of 1
one 1
continuous 1
culture 1
with 1
no 1
men 1
back 1
of 1
that 1
only 1
traditions 1
of 1
the 1
harem 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
exact 1
analogue 1
for 1
our 1
word 1
home 1
any 1
more 1
than 1
they 1
had 1
for 1
our 1
roman 1
based 1
family 1
they 1
loved 1
one 1
another 1
with 1
a 1
practically 1
universal 1
affection 1
rising 1
to 1
exquisite 1
and 1
unbroken 1
friendships 1
and 1
broadening 1
to 1
a 1
devotion 1
to 1
their 1
country 1
and 1
people 1
for 1
which 1
our 1
word 1
patriotism 1
is 1
no 1
definition 1
at 1
all 1
patriotism 1
red 1
hot 1
is 1
compatible 1
with 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
a 1
neglect 1
of 1
national 1
interests 1
a 1
dishonesty 1
a 1
cold 1
indifference 1
to 1
the 1
suffering 1
of 1
millions 1
patriotism 1
is 1
largely 1
pride 1
and 1
very 1
largely 1
combativeness 1
patriotism 1
generally 1
has 1
a 1
chip 1
on 1
its 1
shoulder 1
this 1
country 1
had 1
no 1
other 1
country 1
to 1
measure 1
itself 1
by 1
save 1
the 1
few 1
poor 1
savages 1
far 1
below 1
with 1
whom 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
contact 1
they 1
loved 1
their 1
country 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
their 1
nursery 1
playground 1
and 1
workshop 1
theirs 1
and 1
their 1
children 1
s 1
they 1
were 1
proud 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
workshop 1
proud 1
of 1
their 1
record 1
of 1
ever 1
increasing 1
efficiency 1
they 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
pleasant 1
garden 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
very 1
practical 1
little 1
heaven 1
but 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
they 1
valued 1
it 1
and 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
hard 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
understand 1
them 1
as 1
a 1
cultural 1
environment 1
for 1
their 1
children 1
that 1
of 1
course 1
is 1
the 1
keynote 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
distinction 1
their 1
children 1
from 1
those 1
first 1
breathlessly 1
guarded 1
half 1
adored 1
race 1
mothers 1
all 1
up 1
the 1
ascending 1
line 1
they 1
had 1
this 1
dominant 1
thought 1
of 1
building 1
up 1
a 1
great 1
race 1
through 1
the 1
children 1
all 1
the 1
surrendering 1
devotion 1
our 1
women 1
have 1
put 1
into 1
their 1
private 1
families 1
these 1
women 1
put 1
into 1
their 1
country 1
and 1
race 1
all 1
the 1
loyalty 1
and 1
service 1
men 1

empty 1
nest 1
all 1
this 1
feeling 1
with 1
them 1
flowed 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
strong 1
wide 1
current 1
unbroken 1
through 1
the 1
generations 1
deepening 1
and 1
widening 1
through 1
the 1
years 1
including 1
every 1
child 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
with 1
their 1
united 1
power 1
and 1
wisdom 1
they 1
had 1
studied 1
and 1
overcome 1
the 1
diseases 1
of 1
childhood 1

none 1
they 1
had 1
faced 1
the 1
problems 1
of 1
education 1
and 1
so 1
solved 1
them 1
that 1
their 1
children 1
grew 1
up 1
as 1
naturally 1
as 1
young 1
trees 1
learning 1
through 1
every 1
sense 1
taught 1
continuously 1
but 1
unconsciously 1
never 1
knowing 1
they 1
were 1
being 1
educated 1
in 1
fact 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
use 1
the 1
word 1
as 1
we 1
do 1
their 1
idea 1
of 1
education 1
was 1
the 1
special 1
training 1
they 1
took 1
when 1
half 1
grown 1
up 1
under 1
experts 1
then 1
the 1
eager 1
young 1
minds 1
fairly 1
flung 1
themselves 1
on 1
their 1
chosen 1
subjects 1
and 1
acquired 1
with 1
an 1
ease 1
a 1
breadth 1
a 1
grasp 1
at 1
which 1
i 1
never 1
ceased 1
to 1
wonder 1
but 1
the 1
babies 1
and 1
little 1
children 1
never 1
felt 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
that 1
forcible 1
feeding 1
of 1
the 1
mind 1
that 1

trying 1
to 1
show 1
here 1
is 1
that 1
with 1
these 1
women 1
the 1
whole 1
relationship 1
of 1
life 1
counted 1
in 1
a 1
glad 1
eager 1
growing 1

ranks 1

loved 1
a 1
deep 1
tender 1
reverence 1
for 1
one 1
s 1
own 1
mother 1
too 1
deep 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
freely 1
and 1
beyond 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
free 1
wide 1
range 1
of 1
sisterhood 1
the 1
splendid 1
service 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
friendships 1
to 1
these 1
women 1
we 1
came 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
ideas 1
convictions 1
traditions 1
of 1
our 1
culture 1
and 1
undertook 1
to 1
rouse 1
in 1
them 1
the 1
emotions 1
which 1
to 1
us 1
seemed 1
proper 1
however 1
much 1
or 1
little 1
of 1
true 1
sex 1
feeling 1
there 1
was 1
between 1
us 1
it 1
phrased 1
itself 1
in 1
their 1
minds 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
friendship 1
the 1
one 1
purely 1
personal 1
love 1
they 1
knew 1
and 1
of 1
ultimate 1
parentage 1
visibly 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
mothers 1
nor 1
children 1
nor 1
compatriots 1
so 1
if 1
they 1
loved 1
us 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
friends 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
pair 1
off 1
together 1
in 1
our 1
courting 1
days 1
was 1
natural 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
we 1
three 1
should 1
remain 1
much 1
together 1
as 1
they 1
did 1
themselves 1
was 1
also 1
natural 1
we 1
had 1
as 1
yet 1
no 1
work 1
so 1
we 1
hung 1
about 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
forest 1
tasks 1
that 1
was 1
natural 1
too 1
but 1
when 1
we 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
each 1
couple 1
having 1
homes 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
it 1
our 1
work 1
takes 1
us 1
all 1
around 1
the 1
country 1
explained 1
celis 1
we 1
cannot 1
live 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
are 1
together 1
now 1
urged 1
alima 1
looking 1
proudly 1
at 1
terry 1
s 1
stalwart 1
nearness 1
this 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
times 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
on 1
though 1
presently 1
off 1
again 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
at 1
all 1
he 1
insisted 1
a 1
man 1
wants 1
a 1
home 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
with 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
family 1
in 1
it 1
staying 1
in 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
asked 1
ellador 1
not 1
imprisoned 1
surely 1
of 1
course 1
not 1
living 1
there 1
naturally 1
he 1
answered 1
what 1
does 1
she 1
do 1
there 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
alima 1
demanded 1
what 1
is 1
her 1
work 1
then 1
terry 1
patiently 1
explained 1
again 1
that 1
our 1
women 1
did 1
not 1
work 1
with 1
reservations 1
but 1
what 1
do 1
they 1
do 1
if 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
work 1
she 1
persisted 1
they 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
the 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
asked 1
ellador 1
why 1
yes 1
the 1
children 1
play 1
about 1
and 1
the 1
mother 1
has 1
charge 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
there 1
are 1
servants 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
seemed 1
so 1
obvious 1
so 1
natural 1
to 1
terry 1
that 1
he 1
always 1
grew 1
impatient 1
but 1
the 1
girls 1
were 1
honestly 1
anxious 1
to 1
understand 1
how 1
many 1
children 1
do 1
your 1
women 1
have 1
alima 1
had 1
her 1
notebook 1
out 1
now 1
and 1
a 1
rather 1
firm 1
set 1
of 1
lip 1
terry 1
began 1
to 1
dodge 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
set 1
number 1
my 1
dear 1
he 1
explained 1
some 1
have 1
more 1
some 1
have 1
less 1
some 1
have 1
none 1
at 1
all 1
i 1
put 1
in 1
mischievously 1
they 1
pounced 1
on 1
this 1
admission 1
and 1
soon 1
wrung 1
from 1
us 1
the 1
general 1
fact 1
that 1
those 1
women 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
most 1
children 1
had 1
the 1
least 1
servants 1
and 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
most 1
servants 1
had 1
the 1
least 1
children 1
there 1
triumphed 1
alima 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
or 1
no 1
children 1
and 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
servants 1
now 1
what 1
do 1
those 1
women 1
do 1
we 1
explained 1
as 1
best 1
we 1
might 1
we 1
talked 1
of 1
social 1
duties 1
disingenuously 1
banking 1
on 1
their 1
not 1
interpreting 1
the 1
words 1
as 1
we 1
did 1
we 1
talked 1
of 1
hospitality 1
entertainment 1
and 1
various 1
interests 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
knew 1
that 1
to 1
these 1
large 1
minded 1
women 1
whose 1
whole 1
mental 1
outlook 1
was 1
so 1
collective 1
the 1
limitations 1
of 1
a 1
wholly 1
personal 1
life 1
were 1
inconceivable 1
we 1
cannot 1
really 1
understand 1
it 1
ellador 1
concluded 1
we 1
are 1
only 1
half 1
a 1
people 1
we 1
have 1
our 1
woman 1
ways 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
their 1
man 1
ways 1
and 1
their 1
both 1
ways 1
we 1
have 1
worked 1
out 1
a 1
system 1
of 1
living 1
which 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
limited 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
broader 1
richer 1
better 1
one 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
you 1
shall 1
dearest 1
i 1
whispered 1
there 1
s 1
nothing 1
to 1
smoke 1
complained 1
terry 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
prolonged 1
quarrel 1
with 1
alima 1
and 1
needed 1
a 1
sedative 1
there 1
s 1
nothing 1
to 1
drink 1
these 1
blessed 1
women 1
have 1
no 1
pleasant 1
vices 1
i 1
wish 1
we 1
could 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
this 1
wish 1
was 1
vain 1
we 1
were 1
always 1
under 1
a 1
certain 1
degree 1
of 1
watchfulness 1
when 1
terry 1
burst 1
forth 1
to 1
tramp 1
the 1
streets 1
at 1
night 1
he 1
always 1
found 1
a 1
colonel 1
here 1
or 1
there 1
and 1
when 1
on 1
an 1
occasion 1
of 1
fierce 1
though 1
temporary 1
despair 1
he 1
had 1
plunged 1
to 1
the 1
cliff 1
edge 1
with 1
some 1
vague 1
view 1
to 1
escape 1
he 1
found 1
several 1
of 1
them 1
close 1
by 1
we 1
were 1
free 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
string 1
to 1
it 1
they 1
ve 1
no 1
unpleasant 1
ones 1
either 1
jeff 1
reminded 1
him 1
wish 1
they 1
had 1
terry 1
persisted 1
they 1
ve 1
neither 1
the 1
vices 1

the 1
virtues 1

better 1
than 1
that 1

said 1
i 1
severely 1
i 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
ellador 1
s 1
eyes 1
when 1
they 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
certain 1
look 1

look 1
she 1
did 1
not 1

equally 1
incensed 1

all 1
of 1

terry 1
no 1

of 1
that 1
natural 1
yielding 1
which 1

i 1
shook 1
my 1

pityingly 1

and 1
apologize 1
and 1
make 1
friends 1
again 1

ve 1
got 1
a 1
grouch 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
these 1

the 1
virtue 1
of 1
humanity 1
with 1
less 1
of 1
its 1
faults 1
than 1
any 1
folks 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
as 1
for 1
patience 1
they 1
d 1
have 1
pitched 1
us 1
over 1
the 1
cliffs 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
we 1
lit 1
among 1
em 1
if 1

and 1
you 1

jeff 1
retorted 1
hotly 1
i 1
never 1

i 1
never 1

of 1

universal 1
peace 1

you 1

a 1
perpetual 1
sunday 1
school 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
but 1
i 1
like 1
something 1
doing 1
here 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
done 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
to 1
this 1
criticism 1
the 1
years 1
of 1
pioneering 1
lay 1
far 1
behind 1
them 1
theirs 1
was 1
a 1
civilization 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
initial 1
difficulties 1
had 1
long 1
since 1
been 1
overcome 1
the 1
untroubled 1
peace 1
the 1
unmeasured 1
plenty 1
the 1
steady 1
health 1
the 1
large 1
good 1

and 1
smooth 1
management 1
which 1
ordered 1
everything 1
left 1
nothing 1
to 1
overcome 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
pleasant 1
family 1
in 1
an 1
old 1
established 1
perfectly 1
run 1
country 1
place 1
i 1
liked 1
it 1
because 1
of 1
my 1
eager 1

continued 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
sociological 1
achievements 1

it 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
such 1
a 1
family 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
anywhere 1
terry 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
it 1
because 1
he 1
found 1
nothing 1
to 1
oppose 1
to 1
struggle 1
with 1
to 1
conquer 1
life 1
is 1
a 1
struggle 1
has 1
to 1
be 1

insisted 1
if 1

he 1
rather 1
had 1
us 1
there 1
the 1
drama 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
to 1
our 1
taste 1
rather 1
flat 1
you 1
see 1
they 1
lacked 1
the 1
sex 1
motive 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
jealousy 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
interplay 1
of 1
warring 1
nations 1
no 1
aristocracy 1
and 1
its 1
ambitions 1
no 1

i 1
see 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
little 1
about 1
the 1
economics 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
it 1
should 1
have 1
come 1
before 1
but 1
i 1
ll 1
go 1
on 1
about 1
the 1
drama 1
now 1
they 1
had 1
their 1
own 1
kind 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
impressive 1
array 1
of 1
pageantry 1
of 1
processions 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
grand 1
ritual 1
with 1
their 1
arts 1
and 1
their 1
religion 1
broadly 1
blended 1
the 1
very 1
babies 1
joined 1
in 1
it 1
to 1
see 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
great 1
annual 1
festivals 1
with 1
the 1
massed 1
and 1
marching 1
stateliness 1
of 1
those 1
great 1
mothers 1
the 1
young 1
women 1
brave 1
and 1
noble 1
beautiful 1
and 1
strong 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
children 1
taking 1
part 1
as 1
naturally 1
as 1
ours 1
would 1
frolic 1
round 1
a 1
christmas 1
tree 1
it 1
was 1
overpowering 1
in 1
the 1
impression 1
of 1
joyous 1
triumphant 1
life 1
they 1
had 1
begun 1
at 1
a 1
period 1
when 1
the 1
drama 1
the 1
dance 1
music 1
religion 1
and 1
education 1
were 1
all 1
very 1
close 1
together 1
and 1
instead 1
of 1
developing 1
them 1
in 1
detached 1
lines 1
they 1
had 1
kept 1
the 1
connection 1
let 1
me 1
try 1
again 1
to 1
give 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
a 1
faint 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
difference 1
in 1
the 1
life 1
view 1
the 1
background 1
and 1
basis 1
on 1
which 1
their 1
culture 1
rested 1
ellador 1
told 1
me 1
a 1
lot 1
about 1
it 1
she 1
took 1
me 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
children 1
the 1
growing 1
girls 1
the 1
special 1
teachers 1
she 1
picked 1
out 1
books 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
read 1
she 1
always 1
seemed 1
to 1
understand 1
just 1
what 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
and 1
how 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
while 1
terry 1
and 1
alima 1
struck 1
sparks 1
and 1
parted 1
he 1
always 1
madly 1
drawn 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
or 1
she 1
d 1
never 1
have 1
stood 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
behaved 1
ellador 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
already 1
a 1
deep 1
restful 1
feeling 1
as 1
if 1
we 1
d 1
always 1
had 1
one 1
another 1
jeff 1
and 1
celis 1
were 1
happy 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
question 1
of 1
that 1
but 1
it 1
didn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
good 1
times 1
we 1
did 1
well 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
herland 1
child 1
facing 1
life 1
as 1
ellador 1
tried 1
to 1
show 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
memory 1
they 1
knew 1
peace 1
beauty 1
order 1
safety 1
love 1
wisdom 1
justice 1
patience 1
and 1
plenty 1
by 1
plenty 1
i 1
mean 1
that 1
the 1
babies 1
grew 1
up 1
in 1
an 1
environment 1
which 1
met 1
their 1
needs 1
just 1
as 1
young 1
fawns 1
might 1
grow 1
up 1
in 1
dewy 1
forest 1
glades 1
and 1
brook 1
fed 1
meadows 1
and 1
they 1
enjoyed 1
it 1
as 1
frankly 1
and 1
utterly 1
as 1
the 1
fawns 1
would 1
they 1
found 1
themselves 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
bright 1
lovely 1
world 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
and 1
enchanting 1
things 1
to 1
learn 1
about 1
and 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
people 1
everywhere 1
were 1
friendly 1
and 1
polite 1
no 1
herland 1
child 1
ever 1
met 1
the 1
overbearing 1
rudeness 1
we 1
so 1
commonly 1
show 1
to 1
children 1
they 1
were 1
people 1
too 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
the 1
most 1
precious 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
nation 1
in 1
each 1
step 1
of 1
the 1
rich 1
experience 1
of 1
living 1
they 1
found 1
the 1
instance 1
they 1
were 1
studying 1
widen 1
out 1
into 1
contact 1
with 1
an 1
endless 1
range 1
of 1
common 1
interests 1
the 1
things 1
they 1
learned 1
were 1
related 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
related 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
national 1
prosperity 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
butterfly 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
a 1
forester 1
said 1
ellador 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
eleven 1
years 1
old 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
big 1
purple 1
and 1
green 1
butterfly 1
on 1
a 1
low 1
flower 1
i 1
caught 1
it 1
very 1
carefully 1
by 1
the 1
closed 1
wings 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
told 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
carried 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
nearest 1
insect 1
teacher 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
note 1
there 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
an 1
insect 1
teacher 1
was 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
its 1
name 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
delight 1
oh 1
you 1
blessed 1
child 1
she 1
said 1
do 1
you 1
like 1
obernuts 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
liked 1
obernuts 1
and 1
said 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
our 1
best 1
food 1
nut 1
you 1
know 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
female 1
of 1
the 1
obernut 1
moth 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
they 1
are 1
almost 1
gone 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
trying 1
to 1
exterminate 1
them 1
for 1
centuries 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
not 1
caught 1
this 1
one 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
laid 1
eggs 1
enough 1
to 1
raise 1
worms 1
enough 1
to 1
destroy 1
thousands 1
of 1
our 1
nut 1
trees 1
thousands 1
of 1
bushels 1
of 1
nuts 1
and 1
make 1
years 1
and 1
years 1
of 1
trouble 1
for 1
us 1
everybody 1
congratulated 1
me 1
the 1
children 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
country 1
were 1
told 1
to 1
watch 1
for 1
that 1
moth 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
more 1
i 1
was 1
shown 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
and 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
damage 1
it 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
of 1
how 1
long 1
and 1
hard 1
our 1
foremothers 1
had 1
worked 1
to 1
save 1
that 1
tree 1
for 1
us 1
i 1
grew 1
a 1
foot 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
determined 1
then 1
and 1
there 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
forester 1
this 1
is 1
but 1
an 1
instance 1
she 1
showed 1
me 1
many 1
the 1
big 1
difference 1
was 1
that 1
whereas 1
our 1
children 1
grow 1
up 1
in 1
private 1
homes 1
and 1
families 1
with 1
every 1
effort 1
made 1
to 1
protect 1
and 1
seclude 1
them 1
from 1
a 1
dangerous 1
world 1
here 1
they 1
grew 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
wide 1
friendly 1
world 1
and 1
knew 1
it 1
for 1
theirs 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
their 1
child 1
literature 1
was 1
a 1
wonderful 1
thing 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
spent 1
years 1
following 1
the 1
delicate 1
subtleties 1
the 1
smooth 1
simplicities 1
with 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
bent 1
that 1
great 1
art 1
to 1
the 1
service 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
mind 1
we 1
have 1
two 1
life 1
cycles 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
woman 1
s 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
there 1
is 1
growth 1
struggle 1
conquest 1
the 1
establishment 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
further 1
success 1
in 1
gain 1
or 1
ambition 1
as 1
he 1
can 1
achieve 1
to 1
the 1
woman 1
growth 1
the 1
securing 1
of 1
a 1
husband 1
the 1
subordinate 1
activities 1
of 1
family 1
life 1
and 1
afterward 1
such 1
social 1
or 1
charitable 1
interests 1
as 1
her 1
position 1
allows 1
here 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
cycle 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
large 1
one 1
the 1
child 1
entered 1
upon 1
a 1
broad 1
open 1
field 1
of 1
life 1
in 1
which 1
motherhood 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
great 1
personal 1
contribution 1
to 1
the 1
national 1
life 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
the 1
individual 1
share 1
in 1
their 1
common 1
activities 1
every 1
girl 1
i 1
talked 1
to 1
at 1
any 1
age 1
above 1
babyhood 1
had 1
her 1
cheerful 1
determination 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
when 1
she 1
grew 1
up 1
what 1
terry 1
meant 1
by 1
saying 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
modesty 1
was 1
that 1
this 1
great 1
life 1
view 1
had 1
no 1
shady 1
places 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
high 1
sense 1
of 1
personal 1
decorum 1
but 1
no 1
shame 1
no 1
knowledge 1
of 1
anything 1
to 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
even 1
their 1
shortcomings 1
and 1
misdeeds 1
in 1
childhood 1
never 1
were 1
presented 1
to 1
them 1
as 1
sins 1
merely 1
as 1
errors 1
and 1
misplays 1
as 1
in 1
a 1
game 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
who 1
were 1
palpably 1
less 1
agreeable 1
than 1
others 1
or 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
real 1
weakness 1
or 1
fault 1
were 1
treated 1
with 1
cheerful 1
allowance 1
as 1
a 1
friendly 1
group 1
at 1
whist 1
would 1
treat 1
a 1
poor 1
player 1
their 1
religion 1
you 1
see 1
was 1
maternal 1
and 1
their 1
ethics 1
based 1
on 1
the 1
full 1
perception 1
of 1
evolution 1
showed 1
the 1
principle 1
of 1
growth 1
and 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
wise 1
culture 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
theory 1
of 1
the 1
essential 1
opposition 1
of 1
good 1
and 1
evil 1
life 1
to 1
them 1
was 1
growth 1
their 1
pleasure 1
was 1
in 1
growing 1
and 1
their 1
duty 1
also 1
with 1
this 1
background 1
with 1
their 1
sublimated 1
mother 1
love 1
expressed 1
in 1
terms 1
of 1
widest 1
social 1
activity 1
every 1
phase 1
of 1
their 1
work 1
was 1
modified 1
by 1
its 1
effect 1
on 1
the 1
national 1
growth 1
the 1
language 1
itself 1
they 1
had 1
deliberately 1
clarified 1
simplified 1
made 1
easy 1
and 1
beautiful 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
this 1
seemed 1
to 1
us 1
a 1
wholly 1
incredible 1
thing 1
first 1
that 1
any 1
nation 1
should 1
have 1
the 1
foresight 1
the 1
strength 1
and 1
the 1
persistence 1
to 1
plan 1
and 1
fulfill 1
such 1
a 1
task 1
and 1
second 1
that 1
women 1
should 1
have 1
had 1
so 1
much 1
initiative 1
we 1
have 1
assumed 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
women 1
had 1
none 1
that 1
only 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
his 1
natural 1
energy 1
and 1
impatience 1
of 1
restriction 1
would 1
ever 1
invent 1
anything 1
here 1
we 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
life 1
upon 1
the 1
environment 1
develops 1
in 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
its 1
inventive 1
reactions 1
regardless 1
of 1
sex 1
and 1
further 1
that 1
a 1

works 1
without 1

for 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
the 1
child 1

the 1
children 1
might 1
be 1
most 1
nobly 1
born 1

in 1

calculated 1
to 1
allow 1
the 1
richest 1

growth 1

had 1
deliberately 1
remodeled 1
and 1
improved 1
the 1
whole 1
state 1
i 1

not 1

in 1
the 1

at 1
childhood 1

impressive 1
part 1
of 1
their 1
whole 1
culture 1
beyond 1
this 1
perfect 1
system 1
of 1
child 1
rearing 1
was 1

of 1
interests 1
and 1
associations 1
open 1
to 1
them 1
all 1
for 1
life 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
literature 1
i 1
was 1
most 1
struck 1
at 1
first 1
by 1
the 1
child 1
motive 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
gradation 1
of 1
simple 1
repetitive 1
verse 1
and 1
story 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
familiar 1
with 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
exquisite 1
imaginative 1
tales 1
but 1
where 1
with 1
us 1
these 1
are 1
the 1
dribbled 1
remnants 1
of 1
ancient 1
folk 1
myths 1
and 1
primitive 1
lullabies 1
theirs 1
were 1
the 1
exquisite 1
work 1
of 1
great 1
artists 1
not 1
only 1
simple 1
and 1
unfailing 1
in 1
appeal 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
mind 1
but 1
true 1
true 1
to 1
the 1
living 1
world 1
about 1
them 1
to 1
sit 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
nurseries 1
for 1
a 1
day 1
was 1
to 1
change 1
one 1
s 1
views 1
forever 1
as 1
to 1
babyhood 1
the 1
youngest 1
ones 1
rosy 1
fatlings 1
in 1
their 1
mothers 1
arms 1
or 1
sleeping 1
lightly 1
in 1
the 1
flower 1
sweet 1
air 1
seemed 1
natural 1
enough 1
save 1
that 1
they 1
never 1
cried 1
i 1
never 1
heard 1
a 1
child 1
cry 1
in 1
herland 1
save 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
at 1
a 1
bad 1
fall 1
and 1
then 1
people 1
ran 1
to 1
help 1
as 1
we 1
would 1
at 1
a 1
scream 1
of 1
agony 1
from 1
a 1
grown 1
person 1
each 1
mother 1
had 1
her 1
year 1
of 1
glory 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
love 1
and 1
learn 1
living 1
closely 1
with 1
her 1
child 1
nursing 1
it 1
proudly 1
often 1
for 1
two 1
years 1
or 1
more 1
this 1
perhaps 1
was 1
one 1
reason 1
for 1
their 1
wonderful 1
vigor 1
but 1
after 1
the 1
baby 1
year 1
the 1
mother 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
constantly 1
in 1
attendance 1
unless 1
indeed 1
her 1
work 1
was 1
among 1
the 1
little 1
ones 1
she 1
was 1
never 1
far 1
off 1
however 1
and 1
her 1
attitude 1
toward 1
the 1
co 1
mothers 1
whose 1
proud 1
child 1
service 1
was 1
direct 1
and 1
continuous 1
was 1
lovely 1
to 1
see 1
as 1
for 1
the 1
babies 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
those 1
naked 1
darlings 1
playing 1
on 1
short 1
velvet 1
grass 1
clean 1
swept 1
or 1
rugs 1
as 1
soft 1
or 1
in 1
shallow 1
pools 1
of 1
bright 1
water 1
tumbling 1
over 1
with 1
bubbling 1
joyous 1
baby 1
laughter 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
infant 1
happiness 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
dreamed 1
the 1
babies 1
were 1
reared 1
in 1
the 1
warmer 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
gradually 1
acclimated 1
to 1
the 1
cooler 1
heights 1
as 1
they 1
grew 1
older 1
sturdy 1
children 1
of 1
ten 1
and 1
twelve 1
played 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
as 1
joyfully 1
as 1
ours 1
do 1
there 1
were 1
continuous 1
excursions 1
of 1
them 1
from 1
one 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
to 1
another 1
so 1
that 1
to 1
each 1
child 1
the 1
whole 1
country 1
might 1
be 1
home 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
theirs 1
waiting 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
learn 1
to 1
love 1
to 1
use 1
to 1
serve 1
as 1
our 1
own 1
little 1
boys 1
plan 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
big 1
soldier 1
or 1
a 1
cowboy 1
or 1
whatever 1
pleases 1
their 1
fancy 1
and 1
our 1
little 1
girls 1
plan 1
for 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
home 1
they 1
mean 1
to 1
have 1
or 1
how 1
many 1
children 1
these 1
planned 1
freely 1
and 1
gaily 1
with 1
much 1
happy 1
chattering 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
do 1
for 1
the 1
country 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
grown 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
eager 1
happiness 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
and 1
young 1
people 1
which 1
first 1
made 1
me 1
see 1
the 1
folly 1
of 1
that 1
common 1
notion 1
of 1
ours 1
that 1
if 1
life 1
was 1
smooth 1
and 1
happy 1
people 1
would 1
not 1
enjoy 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
studied 1
these 1
youngsters 1
vigorous 1
joyous 1
eager 1
little 1
creatures 1
and 1
their 1
voracious 1
appetite 1
for 1
life 1
it 1
shook 1
my 1
previous 1
ideas 1
so 1
thoroughly 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
re 1
established 1
the 1
steady 1
level 1
of 1
good 1
health 1
gave 1
them 1
all 1
that 1
natural 1
stimulus 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
call 1
animal 1
spirits 1
an 1
odd 1
contradiction 1
in 1
terms 1
they 1
found 1
themselves 1
in 1
an 1
immediate 1
environment 1
which 1
was 1
agreeable 1
and 1
interesting 1
and 1
before 1
them 1
stretched 1
the 1
years 1
of 1
learning 1
and 1
discovery 1
the 1
fascinating 1
endless 1
process 1
of 1
education 1
as 1
i 1
looked 1
into 1
these 1
methods 1
and 1
compared 1
them 1
with 1
our 1
own 1
my 1
strange 1
uncomfortable 1
sense 1
of 1
race 1
humility 1
grew 1
apace 1
ellador 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
my 1
astonishment 1
she 1
explained 1
things 1
kindly 1
and 1
sweetly 1
but 1
with 1
some 1
amazement 1
that 1
they 1
needed 1
explaining 1
and 1
with 1
sudden 1
questions 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
we 1
did 1
it 1
that 1
left 1
me 1
meeker 1
than 1
ever 1
i 1
betook 1
myself 1
to 1
somel 1
one 1
day 1
carefully 1
not 1
taking 1
ellador 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
mind 1
seeming 1
foolish 1
to 1
somel 1
she 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
i 1
want 1
a 1
chapter 1
of 1
explanation 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
you 1
know 1
my 1
stupidities 1
by 1
heart 1
and 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
show 1
them 1
to 1
ellador 1
she 1
thinks 1
me 1
so 1
wise 1
she 1
smiled 1
delightedly 1
it 1
is 1
beautiful 1
to 1
see 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
this 1
new 1
wonderful 1
love 1
between 1
you 1
the 1
whole 1
country 1
is 1
interested 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
can 1
we 1
help 1
it 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
we 1
say 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
loves 1
a 1
lover 1
but 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
million 1
people 1
watching 1
one 1
s 1
courtship 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
difficult 1
one 1
was 1
rather 1
embarrassing 1
tell 1
me 1
about 1
your 1
theory 1
of 1
education 1
i 1
said 1
make 1
it 1
short 1
and 1
easy 1
and 1
to 1
show 1
you 1
what 1
puzzles 1
me 1
i 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
in 1
our 1
theory 1
great 1
stress 1
is 1
laid 1
on 1
the 1
forced 1
exertion 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
mind 1
we 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
good 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
overcome 1
obstacles 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
she 1
unexpectedly 1
agreed 1
all 1
our 1
children 1
do 1
that 1
they 1
love 1
to 1
that 1
puzzled 1
me 1
again 1
if 1
they 1
loved 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
how 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
educational 1
our 1
theory 1
is 1
this 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
carefully 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
young 1
human 1
being 1
the 1
mind 1
is 1
as 1
natural 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
the 1
body 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
grows 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
use 1
and 1
enjoy 1
we 1
seek 1
to 1
nourish 1
to 1
stimulate 1
to 1
exercise 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
as 1
we 1
do 1
the 1
body 1
there 1
are 1
the 1
two 1
main 1
divisions 1
in 1
education 1
you 1
have 1
those 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
things 1
it 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
know 1
and 1
the 1
things 1
it 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
do 1
to 1
do 1
mental 1
exercises 1
you 1
mean 1
yes 1
our 1
general 1
plan 1
is 1
this 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
feeding 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
furnishing 1
information 1
we 1
use 1
our 1
best 1
powers 1
to 1
meet 1
the 1
natural 1
appetite 1
of 1
a 1
healthy 1
young 1
brain 1
not 1
to 1
overfeed 1
it 1
to 1
provide 1
such 1
amount 1
and 1
variety 1
of 1
impressions 1
as 1
seem 1
most 1
welcome 1
to 1
each 1
child 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
easiest 1
part 1
the 1
other 1
division 1
is 1
in 1
arranging 1
a 1
properly 1
graduated 1
series 1
of 1
exercises 1
which 1
will 1
best 1
develop 1
each 1
mind 1
the 1
common 1
faculties 1
we 1
all 1
have 1
and 1
most 1
carefully 1
the 1
especial 1
faculties 1
some 1
of 1
us 1
have 1
you 1
do 1
this 1
also 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
i 1
said 1
rather 1
lamely 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
so 1
subtle 1
and 1
highly 1
developed 1
a 1
system 1
as 1
you 1
not 1
approaching 1
it 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
more 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
information 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
manage 1
it 1
appears 1
that 1
all 1
of 1
you 1
know 1
pretty 1
much 1
everything 1
is 1
that 1
right 1
this 1
she 1
laughingly 1
disclaimed 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
we 1
are 1
as 1
you 1
soon 1
found 1
out 1
extremely 1
limited 1
in 1
knowledge 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
could 1
realize 1
what 1
a 1
ferment 1
the 1
country 1
is 1
in 1
over 1
the 1
new 1
things 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
us 1
the 1
passionate 1
eagerness 1
among 1
thousands 1
of 1
us 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
your 1
country 1
and 1
learn 1
learn 1
learn 1
but 1
what 1
we 1
do 1
know 1
is 1
readily 1
divisible 1
into 1
common 1
knowledge 1
and 1
special 1
knowledge 1
the 1
common 1
knowledge 1
we 1
have 1
long 1
since 1
learned 1
to 1
feed 1
into 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
our 1
little 1
ones 1
with 1
no 1
waste 1
of 1
time 1
or 1
strength 1
the 1
special 1
knowledge 1
is 1
open 1
to 1
all 1
as 1
they 1
desire 1
it 1
some 1
of 1
us 1
specialize 1
in 1
one 1
line 1
only 1
but 1
most 1
take 1
up 1
several 1
some 1
for 1
their 1
regular 1
work 1
some 1
to 1
grow 1
with 1
to 1
grow 1
with 1
yes 1
when 1
one 1
settles 1
too 1
close 1
in 1
one 1
kind 1
of 1
work 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
tendency 1
to 1
atrophy 1
in 1
the 1
disused 1
portions 1
of 1
the 1
brain 1
we 1
like 1
to 1
keep 1
on 1
learning 1
always 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
study 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
know 1
of 1
the 1
different 1
sciences 1
we 1
have 1
within 1
our 1
limits 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
knowledge 1
of 1
anatomy 1
physiology 1
nutrition 1
all 1
that 1
pertains 1
to 1
a 1
full 1
and 1
beautiful 1
personal 1
life 1
we 1
have 1
our 1
botany 1
and 1
chemistry 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
very 1
rudimentary 1
but 1
interesting 1
our 1
own 1
history 1
with 1
its 1
accumulating 1
psychology 1
you 1
put 1
psychology 1
with 1
history 1
not 1
with 1
personal 1
life 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
ours 1
it 1
is 1
among 1
and 1
between 1
us 1
and 1
it 1

are 1
at 1

slowly 1
and 1
carefully 1
developing 1
our 1
whole 1
people 1
along 1
these 1
lines 1

it 1
so 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
this 1
i 1
evaded 1
flatly 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
cheerless 1
claim 1
that 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
was 1
no 1
better 1
than 1
in 1
its 1
earliest 1
period 1
of 1
savagery 1
only 1
better 1
informed 1
a 1
statement 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
believed 1
we 1
try 1
most 1
earnestly 1
for 1
two 1
powers 1
somel 1
continued 1
the 1
two 1
that 1
seem 1
to 1
us 1
basically 1
necessary 1
for 1
all 1
noble 1
life 1
a 1
clear 1
far 1
reaching 1
judgment 1
and 1
a 1
strong 1
well 1
used 1
will 1
we 1
spend 1
our 1
best 1
efforts 1
all 1
through 1
childhood 1
and 1
youth 1
in 1
developing 1
these 1
faculties 1
individual 1
judgment 1
and 1
will 1
as 1
part 1
of 1
your 1
system 1
of 1
education 1
you 1
mean 1
exactly 1
as 1
the 1
most 1
valuable 1
part 1
with 1
the 1
babies 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
noticed 1
we 1
first 1
provide 1
an 1
environment 1
which 1
feeds 1
the 1
mind 1
without 1
tiring 1
it 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
simple 1
and 1
interesting 1
things 1
to 1
do 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
old 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
them 1
physical 1
properties 1
of 1
course 1
come 1
first 1
but 1
as 1
early 1
as 1
possible 1
going 1
very 1
carefully 1
not 1
to 1
tax 1
the 1
mind 1
we 1
provide 1
choices 1
simple 1
choices 1
with 1
very 1
obvious 1
causes 1
and 1
consequences 1
you 1
ve 1
noticed 1
the 1
games 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
children 1
seemed 1
always 1
playing 1
something 1
or 1
else 1
sometimes 1
engaged 1
in 1
peaceful 1
researches 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
i 1
had 1
wondered 1
at 1
first 1
when 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
school 1
but 1
soon 1
found 1
that 1
they 1
never 1
did 1
to 1
their 1
knowledge 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
education 1
but 1
no 1
schooling 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
working 1
for 1
some 1
sixteen 1
hundred 1
years 1
devising 1
better 1
and 1
better 1
games 1
for 1
children 1
continued 1
somel 1
i 1
sat 1
aghast 1
devising 1
games 1
i 1
protested 1
making 1
up 1
new 1
ones 1
you 1
mean 1
exactly 1
she 1
answered 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
then 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
kindergarten 1
and 1
the 1
material 1
devised 1
by 1
signora 1
montessori 1
and 1
guardedly 1
replied 1
to 1
some 1
extent 1
but 1
most 1
of 1
our 1
games 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
were 1
very 1
old 1
came 1
down 1
from 1
child 1
to 1
child 1
along 1
the 1
ages 1
from 1
the 1
remote 1
past 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
their 1
effect 1
she 1
asked 1
do 1
they 1
develop 1
the 1
faculties 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
encourage 1
again 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
claims 1
made 1
by 1
the 1
advocates 1
of 1
sports 1
and 1
again 1
replied 1
guardedly 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
part 1
the 1
theory 1
but 1
do 1
the 1
children 1
like 1
it 1
i 1
asked 1
having 1
things 1
made 1
up 1
and 1
set 1
before 1
them 1
that 1
way 1
don 1
t 1
they 1
want 1
the 1
old 1
games 1
you 1
can 1
see 1
the 1
children 1
she 1
answered 1
are 1
yours 1
more 1
contented 1
more 1
interested 1
happier 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
as 1
in 1
truth 1
i 1
never 1
had 1
thought 1
before 1
of 1
the 1
dull 1
bored 1
children 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
whining 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
now 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
groups 1
and 1
gangs 1
hanging 1
about 1
of 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
some 1
one 1
strong 1
spirit 1
who 1
possessed 1
initiative 1
and 1
would 1
start 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
s 1
parties 1
and 1
the 1
onerous 1
duties 1
of 1
the 1
older 1
people 1
set 1
to 1
amuse 1
the 1
children 1
also 1
of 1
that 1
troubled 1
ocean 1
of 1
misdirected 1
activity 1
we 1
call 1
mischief 1
the 1
foolish 1
destructive 1
sometimes 1
evil 1
things 1
done 1
by 1
unoccupied 1
children 1
no 1
said 1
i 1
grimly 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
herland 1
child 1
was 1
born 1
not 1
only 1
into 1
a 1
world 1
carefully 1
prepared 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
fascinating 1
materials 1
and 1
opportunities 1
to 1
learn 1
but 1
into 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
plentiful 1
numbers 1
of 1
teachers 1
teachers 1
born 1
and 1
trained 1
whose 1
business 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
accompany 1
the 1
children 1
along 1
that 1
to 1
us 1
impossible 1
thing 1
the 1
royal 1
road 1
to 1
learning 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
mystery 1
in 1
their 1
methods 1
being 1
adapted 1
to 1
children 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
comprehensible 1
to 1
adults 1
i 1
spent 1
many 1
days 1
with 1
the 1
little 1
ones 1
sometimes 1
with 1
ellador 1
sometimes 1
without 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
crushing 1
pity 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
childhood 1
and 1
for 1
all 1
others 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
known 1
the 1
houses 1
and 1
gardens 1
planned 1
for 1
babies 1
had 1
in 1
them 1
nothing 1
to 1
hurt 1
no 1
stairs 1
no 1
corners 1
no 1
small 1
loose 1
objects 1
to 1
swallow 1
no 1
fire 1
just 1
a 1
babies 1
paradise 1
they 1
were 1
taught 1
as 1
rapidly 1
as 1
feasible 1
to 1
use 1
and 1
control 1
their 1
own 1
bodies 1
and 1
never 1
did 1
i 1
see 1
such 1
sure 1
footed 1
steady 1
handed 1
clear 1
headed 1
little 1
things 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
joy 1
to 1
watch 1
a 1
row 1
of 1
toddlers 1
learning 1
to 1
walk 1
not 1
only 1
on 1
a 1
level 1
floor 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
later 1
on 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
rubber 1
rail 1
raised 1
an 1
inch 1
or 1
two 1
above 1
the 1
soft 1
turf 1
or 1
heavy 1
rugs 1
and 1
falling 1
off 1
with 1
shrieks 1
of 1
infant 1
joy 1
to 1
rush 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
line 1
and 1
try 1
again 1
surely 1
we 1
have 1
noticed 1
how 1
children 1
love 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
on 1
something 1
and 1
walk 1
along 1
it 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
never 1
thought 1
to 1
provide 1
that 1
simple 1
and 1
inexhaustible 1
form 1
of 1
amusement 1
and 1
physical 1
education 1
for 1
the 1
young 1
water 1
they 1
had 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
could 1
swim 1
even 1
before 1
they 1
walked 1
if 1
i 1
feared 1
at 1
first 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
a 1
too 1
intensive 1
system 1
of 1
culture 1
that 1
fear 1
was 1
dissipated 1
by 1
seeing 1
the 1
long 1
sunny 1
days 1
of 1
pure 1
physical 1
merriment 1
and 1
natural 1
sleep 1
in 1
which 1
these 1
heavenly 1
babies 1
passed 1
their 1
first 1
years 1
they 1
never 1
knew 1
they 1
were 1
being 1
educated 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
dream 1
that 1
in 1
this 1
association 1
of 1
hilarious 1
experiment 1
and 1
achievement 1
they 1
were 1
laying 1
the 1
foundation 1
for 1
that 1
close 1
beautiful 1
group 1
feeling 1
into 1
which 1
they 1
grew 1
so 1
firmly 1
with 1
the 1
years 1
this 1
was 1
education 1
for 1
citizenship 1
chapter 1
10 1
their 1
religions 1
and 1
our 1
marriages 1
it 1
took 1
me 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
a 1
foreigner 1
and 1
a 1
species 1
of 1
christian 1
i 1
was 1
that 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
anything 1
to 1
get 1
any 1
clear 1
understanding 1
of 1
the 1
religion 1
of 1
herland 1
its 1
deification 1
of 1
motherhood 1
was 1
obvious 1
enough 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
far 1
more 1
to 1
it 1
than 1
that 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
than 1
my 1
first 1
interpretation 1
of 1
that 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
as 1
i 1
grew 1
to 1
love 1
ellador 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
believed 1
anyone 1
could 1
love 1
anybody 1
as 1
i 1
grew 1
faintly 1
to 1
appreciate 1
her 1
inner 1
attitude 1
and 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
that 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
glimpses 1
of 1
this 1
faith 1
of 1
theirs 1
when 1
i 1
asked 1
her 1
about 1
it 1
she 1
tried 1
at 1
first 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
seeing 1
me 1
flounder 1
asked 1
for 1
more 1
information 1
about 1
ours 1
she 1
soon 1
found 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
many 1
that 1
they 1
varied 1
widely 1
but 1
had 1
some 1
points 1
in 1
common 1
a 1
clear 1
methodical 1
luminous 1
mind 1
had 1
my 1
ellador 1
not 1
only 1
reasonable 1
but 1
swiftly 1
perceptive 1
she 1
made 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
chart 1
superimposing 1
the 1
different 1
religions 1
as 1
i 1
described 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
pin 1
run 1
through 1
them 1
all 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
their 1
common 1
basis 1
being 1
a 1
dominant 1
power 1
or 1
powers 1
and 1
some 1
special 1
behavior 1
mostly 1
taboos 1
to 1
please 1
or 1
placate 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
common 1
features 1
in 1
certain 1
groups 1
of 1
religions 1
but 1
the 1
one 1
always 1
present 1
was 1
this 1
power 1
and 1
the 1
things 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
or 1
not 1
done 1
because 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
trace 1
our 1
human 1
imagery 1
of 1
the 1
divine 1
force 1
up 1
through 1
successive 1
stages 1
of 1
bloodthirsty 1
sensual 1
proud 1
and 1
cruel 1
gods 1
of 1
early 1
times 1
to 1
the 1
conception 1
of 1
a 1
common 1
father 1
with 1
its 1
corollary 1
of 1
a 1
common 1
brotherhood 1
this 1
pleased 1
her 1
very 1
much 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
expatiated 1
on 1
the 1
omniscience 1
omnipotence 1
omnipresence 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
of 1
our 1
god 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
loving 1
kindness 1
taught 1
by 1
his 1
son 1
she 1
was 1
much 1
impressed 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
virgin 1
birth 1
naturally 1
did 1
not 1
astonish 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
greatly 1
puzzled 1
by 1
the 1
sacrifice 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
by 1
the 1
devil 1
and 1
the 1
theory 1
of 1
damnation 1
when 1
in 1
an 1
inadvertent 1
moment 1
i 1
said 1
that 1
certain 1
sects 1
had 1
believed 1
in 1
infant 1
damnation 1
and 1
explained 1
it 1
she 1
sat 1
very 1
still 1
indeed 1
they 1
believed 1
that 1
god 1
was 1
love 1
and 1
wisdom 1
and 1
power 1
yes 1
all 1
of 1
that 1
her 1
eyes 1
grew 1
large 1
her 1
face 1
ghastly 1
pale 1
and 1
yet 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
god 1
could 1
put 1
little 1
new 1
babies 1
to 1
burn 1
for 1
eternity 1
she 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
sudden 1
shuddering 1
and 1
left 1
me 1
running 1
swiftly 1
to 1
the 1
nearest 1
temple 1
every 1
smallest 1
village 1
had 1
its 1
temple 1
and 1
in 1
those 1
gracious 1
retreats 1
sat 1
wise 1
and 1
noble 1
women 1
quietly 1
busy 1
at 1
some 1
work 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
until 1
they 1
were 1
wanted 1
always 1
ready 1
to 1
give 1
comfort 1
light 1
or 1
help 1
to 1
any 1
applicant 1
ellador 1
told 1
me 1
afterward 1
how 1
easily 1
this 1
grief 1
of 1
hers 1
was 1
assuaged 1
and 1
seemed 1
ashamed 1
of 1
not 1
having 1
helped 1
herself 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
accustomed 1
to 1
horrible 1
ideas 1
she 1
said 1
coming 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
rather 1
apologetically 1
we 1
haven 1
t 1
any 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
a 1
thing 1
like 1
that 1
into 1
our 1
minds 1
it 1
s 1
like 1
oh 1
like 1
red 1
pepper 1
in 1
your 1
eyes 1
so 1
i 1
just 1
ran 1
to 1
her 1
blinded 1
and 1
almost 1
screaming 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
it 1
out 1
so 1
quickly 1
so 1
easily 1
how 1
i 1
asked 1
very 1
curious 1
why 1
you 1
blessed 1
child 1
she 1
said 1
you 1
ve 1
got 1
the 1
wrong 1
idea 1
altogether 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
have 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
ever 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
god 1
for 1
there 1
wasn 1
t 1
or 1
such 1
a 1
happening 1
for 1
there 1
wasn 1
t 1
nor 1
even 1
that 1
this 1
hideous 1
false 1
idea 1
was 1
believed 1
by 1
anybody 1
but 1
only 1
this 1
that 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
utterly 1
ignorant 1
will 1
believe 1
anything 1
which 1
you 1
certainly 1
knew 1
before 1
anyhow 1
pursued 1
ellador 1
she 1
turned 1
pale 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
said 1
it 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
lesson 1
to 1
me 1
no 1
wonder 1
this 1
whole 1
nation 1
of 1
women 1
was 1
peaceful 1
and 1
sweet 1
in 1
expression 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
horrible 1
ideas 1
surely 1
you 1
had 1
some 1
when 1
you 1
began 1
i 1
suggested 1
oh 1
yes 1
no 1
doubt 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
our 1
religion 1
grew 1
to 1
any 1
height 1
at 1
all 1
we 1
left 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
course 1
from 1
this 1
as 1
from 1
many 1
other 1
things 1
i 1
grew 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
i 1
finally 1
put 1
in 1
words 1
have 1
you 1
no 1
respect 1
for 1
the 1
past 1
for 1
what 1
was 1
thought 1
and 1
believed 1
by 1
your 1
foremothers 1
why 1
no 1
she 1
said 1
why 1
should 1
we 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
gone 1
they 1
knew 1
less 1
than 1
we 1
do 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
beyond 1
them 1
we 1
are 1
unworthy 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
unworthy 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
who 1
must 1
go 1
beyond 1
us 1
this 1
set 1
me 1
thinking 1
in 1
good 1
earnest 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
imagined 1
simply 1
from 1
hearing 1
it 1
said 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
women 1
were 1
by 1
nature 1
conservative 1
yet 1
these 1
women 1
quite 1
unassisted 1
by 1
any 1
masculine 1
spirit 1
of 1
enterprise 1
had 1
ignored 1
their 1
past 1
and 1
built 1
daringly 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
ellador 1
watched 1
me 1
think 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
pretty 1
much 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
it 1
s 1
because 1
we 1
began 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
way 1
i 1
suppose 1
all 1
our 1
folks 1
were 1
swept 1
away 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
then 1
after 1
that 1
time 1
of 1
despair 1
came 1
those 1
wonder 1
children 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
whole 1
breathless 1
hope 1
of 1
us 1
was 1
for 1
their 1
children 1
if 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
did 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
pride 1
and 1
triumph 1
till 1
we 1
grew 1
too 1
numerous 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
when 1
it 1
all 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
one 1
child 1
apiece 1
we 1
began 1
to 1
really 1
work 1
to 1
make 1
better 1
ones 1
but 1
how 1
does 1
this 1
account 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
radical 1
difference 1
in 1
your 1
religion 1
i 1
persisted 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
couldn 1
t 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
difference 1
very 1
intelligently 1
not 1
being 1
familiar 1
with 1
other 1
religions 1
but 1
that 1
theirs 1
seemed 1
simple 1
enough 1
their 1
great 1
mother 1
spirit 1
was 1
to 1
them 1
what 1
their 1
own 1
motherhood 1
was 1
only 1
magnified 1
beyond 1
human 1
limits 1
that 1
meant 1
that 1
they 1
felt 1
beneath 1
and 1
behind 1
them 1
an 1
upholding 1
unfailing 1
serviceable 1
love 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
the 1
accumulated 1
mother 1
love 1
of 1
the 1
race 1
they 1
felt 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
power 1
just 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
theory 1
of 1
worship 1
i 1
asked 1
her 1
worship 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
singularly 1
difficult 1
to 1
explain 1
this 1
divine 1
love 1
which 1
they 1
felt 1
so 1
strongly 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
ask 1
anything 1
of 1
them 1
any 1
more 1
than 1
our 1
mothers 1
do 1
she 1
said 1
but 1
surely 1
your 1
mothers 1
expect 1
honor 1
reverence 1
obedience 1
from 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
things 1
for 1
your 1
mothers 1
surely 1
oh 1
no 1
she 1
insisted 1
smiling 1
shaking 1
her 1
soft 1
brown 1
hair 1
we 1
do 1
things 1
from 1
our 1
mothers 1
not 1
for 1
them 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
things 1
for 1
them 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
need 1
it 1
you 1
know 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
live 1
on 1
splendidly 1
because 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
we 1
feel 1
about 1
god 1
i 1
meditated 1
again 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
god 1
of 1
battles 1
of 1
ours 1
that 1
jealous 1
god 1
that 1
vengeance 1
is 1
mine 1
god 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
our 1
world 1
nightmare 1
hell 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
theory 1
of 1
eternal 1
punishment 1
then 1
i 1
take 1
it 1
ellador 1
laughed 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
stars 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
tears 1
in 1
them 1
too 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
sorry 1
for 1
me 1
how 1
could 1
we 1
she 1
asked 1
fairly 1
enough 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
punishments 1
in 1
life 1
you 1
see 1
so 1
we 1
don 1
t 1
imagine 1
them 1
after 1
death 1
have 1
you 1
no 1
punishments 1
neither 1
for 1
children 1
nor 1
criminals 1
such 1
mild 1
criminals 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
i 1
urged 1
do 1
you 1
punish 1
a 1
person 1
for 1
a 1
broken 1
leg 1
or 1
a 1
fever 1
we 1
have 1
preventive 1
measures 1
and 1
cures 1
sometimes 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
send 1
the 1
patient 1
to 1
bed 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
but 1
that 1
s 1
not 1
a 1
punishment 1
it 1
s 1
only 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
treatment 1
she 1
explained 1
then 1
studying 1
my 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
more 1
closely 1
she 1
added 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
recognize 1
in 1
our 1
human 1
motherhood 1
a 1
great 1
tender 1
limitless 1
uplifting 1
force 1
patience 1
and 1
wisdom 1
and 1
all 1
subtlety 1
of 1
delicate 1
method 1
we 1
credit 1
god 1
our 1
idea 1
of 1
god 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
and 1
more 1
our 1
mothers 1
are 1
not 1
angry 1
with 1
us 1
why 1
should 1
god 1
be 1
does 1
god 1
mean 1
a 1
person 1
to 1
you 1
this 1
she 1
thought 1
over 1
a 1
little 1
why 1
in 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
close 1
to 1
it 1
in 1
our 1
minds 1
we 1
personify 1
the 1
idea 1
naturally 1
but 1
we 1
certainly 1
do 1
not 1
assume 1
a 1
big 1
woman 1
somewhere 1
who 1
is 1
god 1
what 1
we 1
call 1
god 1
is 1
a 1
pervading 1
power 1
you 1
know 1
an 1
indwelling 1
spirit 1
something 1
inside 1
of 1
us 1
that 1
we 1
want 1
more 1
of 1
is 1
your 1
god 1
a 1
big 1
man 1
she 1
asked 1
innocently 1
why 1
yes 1
to 1
most 1
of 1
us 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
call 1
it 1
an 1
indwelling 1
spirit 1
just 1
as 1
you 1
do 1
but 1
we 1
insist 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
him 1
a 1
person 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
whiskers 1
whiskers 1
oh 1
yes 1
because 1
you 1
have 1
them 1
or 1
do 1
you 1
wear 1
them 1
because 1
he 1
does 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
we 1
shave 1
them 1
off 1
because 1
it 1
seems 1
cleaner 1
and 1
more 1
comfortable 1
does 1
he 1
wear 1
clothes 1
in 1
your 1
idea 1
i 1
mean 1
i 1
was 1
thinking 1
over 1
the 1
pictures 1
of 1
god 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
rash 1
advances 1
of 1
the 1
devout 1
mind 1
of 1
man 1
representing 1
his 1
omnipotent 1
deity 1
as 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
flowing 1
robe 1
flowing 1
hair 1
flowing 1
beard 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
her 1
perfectly 1
frank 1
and 1
innocent 1
questions 1
this 1
concept 1
seemed 1
rather 1
unsatisfying 1
i 1
explained 1
that 1
the 1
god 1
of 1
the 1
christian 1
world 1
was 1
really 1
the 1
ancient 1
hebrew 1
god 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
simply 1
taken 1
over 1
the 1
patriarchal 1
idea 1
that 1
ancient 1
one 1
which 1
quite 1
inevitably 1
clothed 1
its 1
thought 1
of 1
god 1
with 1
the 1
attributes 1
of 1
the 1
patriarchal 1
ruler 1
the 1
grandfather 1
i 1
see 1
she 1
said 1
eagerly 1
after 1
i 1
had 1
explained 1
the 1
genesis 1
and 1
development 1
of 1
our 1
religious 1
ideals 1
they 1
lived 1
in 1
separate 1
groups 1
with 1
a 1
male 1
head 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
probably 1
a 1
little 1
domineering 1
no 1
doubt 1
of 1
that 1
i 1
agreed 1
and 1
we 1
live 1
together 1
without 1
any 1
head 1
in 1
that 1
sense 1
just 1
our 1
chosen 1
leaders 1
that 1
does 1
make 1
a 1
difference 1
your 1
difference 1
is 1
deeper 1
than 1
that 1
i 1
assured 1
her 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
common 1
motherhood 1
your 1
children 1
grow 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
world 1
where 1
everybody 1
loves 1
them 1
they 1
find 1
life 1
made 1
rich 1
and 1
happy 1
for 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
diffused 1
love 1
and 1
wisdom 1
of 1
all 1
mothers 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
easy 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
god 1
in 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
a 1
similar 1
diffused 1
and 1
competent 1
love 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
are 1
far 1
nearer 1
right 1
than 1
we 1
are 1
what 1
i 1
cannot 1
understand 1
she 1
pursued 1
carefully 1
is 1
your 1
preservation 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
ancient 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
this 1
patriarchal 1
idea 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
is 1
thousands 1
of 1
years 1
old 1
oh 1
yes 1
four 1
five 1
six 1
thousand 1
every 1
so 1
many 1
and 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
wonderful 1
progress 1
in 1
those 1
years 1
in 1
other 1
things 1
we 1
certainly 1
have 1
but 1
religion 1
is 1
different 1
you 1
see 1
our 1
religions 1
come 1
from 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
are 1
initiated 1
by 1
some 1
great 1
teacher 1
who 1
is 1
dead 1
he 1
is 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
known 1
the 1
whole 1
thing 1
and 1
taught 1
it 1
finally 1
all 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
believe 1
and 1
obey 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
great 1
hebrew 1
teacher 1
oh 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
different 1
the 1
hebrew 1
religion 1
is 1
an 1
accumulation 1
of 1
extremely 1
ancient 1
traditions 1
some 1
far 1
older 1
than 1
their 1
people 1
and 1
grew 1
by 1
accretion 1
down 1
the 1
ages 1
we 1
consider 1
it 1
inspired 1
the 1
word 1
of 1
god 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
it 1
says 1
so 1
does 1
it 1
say 1
so 1
in 1
as 1
many 1
words 1
who 1
wrote 1
that 1
in 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
recall 1
some 1
text 1
that 1
did 1
say 1
so 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
bring 1
it 1
to 1
mind 1
apart 1
from 1
that 1
she 1
pursued 1
what 1
i 1
cannot 1
understand 1
is 1
why 1
you 1
keep 1
these 1
early 1
religious 1
ideas 1
so 1
long 1
you 1
have 1
changed 1
all 1
your 1
others 1
haven 1
t 1
you 1
pretty 1
generally 1
i 1
agreed 1
but 1
this 1
we 1
call 1
revealed 1
religion 1
and 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
final 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
more 1
about 1
these 1
little 1
temples 1
of 1
yours 1
i 1
urged 1
and 1
these 1
temple 1
mothers 1
you 1
run 1
to 1
then 1
she 1
gave 1
me 1
an 1
extended 1
lesson 1
in 1
applied 1
religion 1
which 1
i 1
will 1
endeavor 1
to 1
concentrate 1
they 1
developed 1
their 1
central 1
theory 1
of 1
a 1
loving 1
power 1
and 1
assumed 1
that 1
its 1
relation 1
to 1
them 1
was 1
motherly 1
that 1
it 1
desired 1
their 1
welfare 1
and 1
especially 1
their 1
development 1
their 1
relation 1
to 1
it 1
similarly 1
was 1
filial 1
a 1
loving 1
appreciation 1
and 1
a 1
glad 1
fulfillment 1
of 1
its 1
high 1
purposes 1
then 1
being 1
nothing 1
if 1
not 1
practical 1
they 1
set 1
their 1
keen 1
and 1
active 1
minds 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
conduct 1
expected 1
of 1
them 1
this 1
worked 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
most 1
admirable 1
system 1
of 1
ethics 1
the 1
principle 1
of 1
love 1
was 1
universally 1
recognized 1
and 1
used 1
patience 1
gentleness 1
courtesy 1
all 1
that 1
we 1
call 1
good 1
breeding 1
was 1
part 1
of 1
their 1
code 1
of 1
conduct 1
but 1
where 1
they 1
went 1
far 1
beyond 1
us 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
special 1
application 1
of 1
religious 1
feeling 1
to 1
every 1
field 1
of 1
life 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
ritual 1
no 1
little 1
set 1
of 1
performances 1
called 1
divine 1
service 1
save 1
those 1
religious 1
pageants 1
i 1
have 1
spoken 1
of 1
and 1
those 1
were 1
as 1
much 1
educational 1
as 1
religious 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
social 1
as 1
either 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
clear 1
established 1
connection 1
between 1
everything 1
they 1
did 1
and 1
god 1
their 1
cleanliness 1
their 1
health 1
their 1
exquisite 1
order 1
the 1
rich 1
peaceful 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
land 1
the 1
happiness 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
constant 1
progress 1
they 1
made 1
all 1
this 1
was 1
their 1
religion 1
they 1
applied 1
their 1
minds 1
to 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
god 1
and 1
worked 1
out 1
the 1
theory 1
that 1
such 1
an 1
inner 1
power 1
demanded 1
outward 1
expression 1
they 1
lived 1
as 1
if 1
god 1
was 1
real 1
and 1
at 1
work 1
within 1
them 1
as 1
for 1
those 1
little 1
temples 1
everywhere 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
were 1
more 1
skilled 1
more 1
temperamentally 1
inclined 1
in 1
this 1
direction 1
than 1
others 1
these 1
whatever 1
their 1
work 1
might 1
be 1
gave 1
certain 1
hours 1
to 1
the 1
temple 1
service 1
which 1
meant 1
being 1
there 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
love 1
and 1
wisdom 1
and 1
trained 1
thought 1
to 1
smooth 1
out 1
rough 1
places 1
for 1
anyone 1
who 1
needed 1
it 1
sometimes 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
real 1
grief 1
very 1
rarely 1
a 1
quarrel 1
most 1
often 1
a 1
perplexity 1
even 1
in 1
herland 1
the 1
human 1
soul 1
had 1
its 1
hours 1
of 1
darkness 1
but 1
all 1
through 1
the 1
country 1
their 1
best 1
and 1
wisest 1
were 1
ready 1
to 1
give 1
help 1
if 1
the 1
difficulty 1
was 1
unusually 1
profound 1
the 1
applicant 1
was 1
directed 1
to 1
someone 1
more 1
specially 1
experienced 1
in 1
that 1
line 1
of 1
thought 1
here 1
was 1
a 1
religion 1
which 1
gave 1
to 1
the 1
searching 1
mind 1
a 1
rational 1
basis 1
in 1
life 1
the 1
concept 1
of 1
an 1
immense 1
loving 1
power 1
working 1
steadily 1
out 1
through 1
them 1
toward 1
good 1
it 1
gave 1
to 1
the 1
soul 1
that 1
sense 1
of 1
contact 1
with 1
the 1
inmost 1
force 1
of 1
perception 1
of 1
the 1
uttermost 1
purpose 1
which 1
we 1
always 1
crave 1
it 1
gave 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
the 1
blessed 1
feeling 1
of 1
being 1
loved 1
loved 1
and 1
understood 1
it 1
gave 1
clear 1
simple 1
rational 1
directions 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
we 1
should 1
live 1
and 1
why 1
and 1
for 1
ritual 1
it 1
gave 1
first 1
those 1
triumphant 1
group 1
demonstrations 1
when 1
with 1
a 1
union 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
arts 1
the 1
revivifying 1
combination 1
of 1
great 1
multitudes 1
moved 1
rhythmically 1
with 1
march 1
and 1
dance 1
song 1
and 1
music 1
among 1
their 1
own 1
noblest 1
products 1
and 1
the 1
open 1
beauty 1
of 1
their 1
groves 1
and 1
hills 1
second 1
it 1
gave 1
these 1
numerous 1
little 1
centers 1
of 1
wisdom 1
where 1
the 1
least 1
wise 1
could 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
wise 1
and 1
be 1
helped 1
it 1
is 1
beautiful 1
i 1
cried 1
enthusiastically 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
practical 1
comforting 1
progressive 1
religion 1
i 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
do 1
love 1
one 1
another 1
you 1
do 1
bear 1
one 1
another 1
s 1
burdens 1
you 1
do 1
realize 1
that 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
is 1
a 1
type 1
of 1
the 1
kingdom 1
of 1
heaven 1
you 1
are 1
more 1
christian 1
than 1
any 1
people 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
but 1
how 1
about 1
death 1
and 1
the 1
life 1
everlasting 1
what 1
does 1
your 1
religion 1
teach 1
about 1
eternity 1
nothing 1
said 1
ellador 1
what 1
is 1
eternity 1
what 1
indeed 1
i 1
tried 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
real 1
hold 1
on 1
the 1
idea 1
it 1
is 1
never 1
stopping 1
never 1
stopping 1
she 1
looked 1
puzzled 1
yes 1
life 1
going 1
on 1
forever 1
oh 1
we 1
see 1
that 1
of 1
course 1
life 1
does 1
go 1
on 1
forever 1
all 1
about 1
us 1
but 1
eternal 1
life 1
goes 1
on 1
without 1
dying 1
the 1
same 1
person 1
yes 1
the 1
same 1
person 1
unending 1
immortal 1
i 1
was 1
pleased 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
something 1
to 1
teach 1
from 1
our 1
religion 1
which 1
theirs 1
had 1
never 1
promulgated 1
here 1
asked 1
ellador 1
never 1
to 1
die 1
here 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
her 1
practical 1
mind 1
heaping 1
up 1
the 1
people 1
and 1
hurriedly 1
reassured 1
her 1
oh 1
no 1
indeed 1
not 1
here 1
hereafter 1
we 1
must 1
die 1
here 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
then 1
we 1
enter 1
into 1
eternal 1
life 1
the 1
soul 1
lives 1
forever 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
she 1
inquired 1
i 1
won 1
t 1
attempt 1
to 1
prove 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
hastily 1
continued 1
let 1
us 1
assume 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
how 1
does 1
this 1
idea 1
strike 1
you 1
again 1
she 1
smiled 1
at 1
me 1
that 1
adorable 1
dimpling 1
tender 1
mischievous 1
motherly 1
smile 1
of 1
hers 1
shall 1
i 1
be 1
quite 1
quite 1
honest 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
anything 1
else 1
i 1
said 1
half 1
gladly 1
and 1
half 1
a 1
little 1
sorry 1
the 1
transparent 1
honesty 1
of 1
these 1
women 1
was 1
a 1
never 1
ending 1
astonishment 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
singularly 1
foolish 1
idea 1
she 1
said 1
calmly 1
and 1
if 1
true 1
most 1
disagreeable 1
now 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
accepted 1
the 1
doctrine 1
of 1
personal 1
immortality 1
as 1
a 1
thing 1
established 1
the 1
efforts 1
of 1
inquiring 1
spiritualists 1
always 1
seeking 1
to 1
woo 1
their 1
beloved 1
ghosts 1
back 1
again 1
never 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
necessary 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
seriously 1
and 1
courageously 1
discussed 1
the 1
subject 1
with 1
myself 1
even 1
i 1
had 1
simply 1
assumed 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
fact 1
and 1
here 1
was 1
the 1
girl 1
i 1
loved 1
this 1
creature 1
whose 1
character 1
constantly 1
revealed 1
new 1
heights 1
and 1
ranges 1
far 1
beyond 1
my 1
own 1
this 1
superwoman 1
of 1
a 1
superland 1
saying 1
she 1
thought 1
immortality 1
foolish 1
she 1
meant 1
it 1
too 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
it 1
for 1
she 1
asked 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
not 1
want 1
it 1
i 1
protested 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
like 1
a 1
candle 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
growing 1
and 1
and 1
being 1
happy 1
forever 1
why 1
no 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
i 1
want 1
my 1
child 1
and 1
my 1
child 1
s 1
child 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
they 1
will 1
why 1
should 1
_i_ 1
want 1
to 1
but 1
it 1
means 1
heaven 1
i 1
insisted 1
peace 1
and 1
beauty 1
and 1
comfort 1
and 1
love 1
with 1
god 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
so 1
eloquent 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
religion 1
she 1
could 1
be 1
horrified 1
at 1
damnation 1
and 1
question 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
salvation 1
but 1
immortality 1
that 1
was 1
surely 1
a 1
noble 1
faith 1
why 1
van 1
she 1
said 1
holding 1
out 1
her 1
hands 1
to 1
me 1
why 1
van 1
darling 1
how 1
splendid 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
feel 1
it 1
so 1
keenly 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
we 1
all 1
want 1
of 1
course 1
peace 1
and 1
beauty 1
and 1
comfort 1
and 1
love 1
with 1
god 1
and 1
progress 1
too 1
remember 1
growth 1
always 1
and 1
always 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
our 1
religion 1
teaches 1
us 1
to 1
want 1
and 1
to 1
work 1
for 1
and 1
we 1
do 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
here 1
i 1
said 1
only 1
for 1
this 1
life 1
on 1
earth 1
well 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
with 1
your 1
beautiful 1
religion 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
service 1
have 1
it 1
here 1
too 1
for 1
this 1
life 1
on 1
earth 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
were 1
willing 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
women 1
of 1
herland 1
about 1
the 1
evils 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
beloved 1
land 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
assume 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
necessary 1
and 1
essential 1
and 1
to 1
criticize 1
strictly 1
among 1
ourselves 1
their 1
all 1
too 1
perfect 1
civilization 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
telling 1
them 1
about 1
the 1
failures 1
and 1
wastes 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
we 1
never 1
could 1
bring 1
ourselves 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
moreover 1
we 1
sought 1
to 1
avoid 1
too 1
much 1
discussion 1
and 1
to 1
press 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
our 1
approaching 1
marriages 1
jeff 1
was 1
the 1
determined 1
one 1
on 1
this 1
score 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
haven 1
t 1
any 1
marriage 1
ceremony 1
or 1
service 1
but 1
we 1
can 1
make 1
it 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
quaker 1
wedding 1
and 1
have 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
temple 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
least 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
for 1
them 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
was 1
so 1
little 1
after 1
all 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
do 1
for 1
them 1
here 1
we 1
were 1
penniless 1
guests 1
and 1
strangers 1
with 1
no 1
chance 1
even 1
to 1
use 1
our 1
strength 1
and 1
courage 1
nothing 1
to 1
defend 1
them 1
from 1
or 1
protect 1
them 1
against 1
we 1
can 1
at 1
least 1
give 1
them 1
our 1
names 1
jeff 1
insisted 1
they 1
were 1
very 1
sweet 1
about 1
it 1
quite 1
willing 1
to 1
do 1
whatever 1
we 1
asked 1
to 1
please 1
us 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
names 1
alima 1
frank 1
soul 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
asked 1
what 1
good 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
terry 1
always 1
irritating 1
her 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
possession 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
mrs 1
nicholson 1
he 1
said 1
mrs 1
t 1
o 1
nicholson 1
that 1
shows 1
everyone 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
wife 1
what 1
is 1
a 1
wife 1
exactly 1
she 1
demanded 1
a 1
dangerous 1
gleam 1
in 1
her 1
eye 1
a 1
wife 1
is 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
belongs 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
he 1
began 1
but 1
jeff 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
eagerly 1
and 1
a 1
husband 1
is 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
belongs 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
we 1
are 1
monogamous 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
marriage 1
is 1
the 1
ceremony 1
civil 1
and 1
religious 1
that 1
joins 1
the 1
two 1
together 1
until 1
death 1
do 1
us 1
part 1
he 1
finished 1
looking 1
at 1
celis 1
with 1
unutterable 1
devotion 1
what 1
makes 1
us 1
all 1
feel 1
foolish 1
i 1
told 1
the 1
girls 1
is 1
that 1
here 1
we 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
except 1
of 1
course 1
our 1
names 1
do 1
your 1
women 1
have 1
no 1
names 1
before 1
they 1
are 1
married 1
celis 1
suddenly 1
demanded 1
why 1
yes 1
jeff 1
explained 1
they 1
have 1
their 1
maiden 1
names 1
their 1
father 1
s 1
names 1
that 1
is 1
and 1
what 1
becomes 1
of 1
them 1
asked 1
alima 1
they 1
change 1
them 1
for 1
their 1
husbands 1
my 1
dear 1
terry 1
answered 1
her 1
change 1
them 1
do 1
the 1
husbands 1
then 1
take 1
the 1
wives 1
maiden 1
names 1
oh 1
no 1
he 1
laughed 1
the 1
man 1
keeps 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
gives 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
too 1
then 1
she 1
just 1
loses 1
hers 1
and 1
takes 1
a 1
new 1
one 1
how 1
unpleasant 1
we 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
that 1
alima 1
said 1
decidedly 1
terry 1
was 1
good 1
humored 1
about 1
it 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
what 1
you 1
do 1
or 1
don 1
t 1
do 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
that 1
wedding 1
pretty 1
soon 1
he 1
said 1
reaching 1
a 1
strong 1
brown 1
hand 1
after 1
alima 1
s 1
quite 1
as 1
brown 1
and 1
nearly 1
as 1
strong 1
as 1
to 1
giving 1
us 1
things 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
can 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
but 1
we 1
are 1
glad 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
celis 1
continued 1
you 1
see 1
we 1
love 1
you 1
just 1
for 1
yourselves 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
want 1
you 1
to 1
to 1
pay 1
anything 1
isn 1
t 1
it 1
enough 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
loved 1
personally 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
men 1
enough 1
or 1
not 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
we 1
were 1
married 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
triple 1
wedding 1
in 1
the 1
biggest 1
temple 1
of 1
all 1
and 1
it 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
nation 1
was 1
present 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
solemn 1
and 1
very 1
beautiful 1
someone 1
had 1
written 1
a 1
new 1
song 1
for 1
the 1
occasion 1
nobly 1
beautiful 1
about 1
the 1
new 1
hope 1
for 1
their 1
people 1
the 1
new 1
tie 1
with 1
other 1
lands 1
brotherhood 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
sisterhood 1
and 1
with 1
evident 1
awe 1
fatherhood 1
terry 1
was 1
always 1
restive 1
under 1
their 1
talk 1
of 1
fatherhood 1
anybody 1
d 1
think 1
we 1
were 1
high 1
priests 1
of 1
of 1
philoprogenitiveness 1
he 1
protested 1
these 1
women 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
but 1
children 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
we 1
ll 1
teach 1
em 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
certain 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
teach 1
and 1
alima 1
so 1
uncertain 1
in 1
her 1
moods 1
of 1
reception 1
that 1
jeff 1
and 1
i 1
feared 1
the 1
worst 1
we 1
tried 1
to 1
caution 1
him 1
much 1
good 1
that 1
did 1
the 1
big 1
handsome 1
fellow 1
drew 1
himself 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
full 1
height 1
lifted 1
that 1
great 1
chest 1
of 1
his 1
and 1
laughed 1
there 1
are 1
three 1
separate 1
marriages 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
won 1
t 1
interfere 1
with 1
yours 1
nor 1
you 1
with 1
mine 1
so 1
the 1
great 1
day 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
countless 1
crowds 1
of 1
women 1
and 1
we 1
three 1
bridegrooms 1
without 1
any 1
supporting 1
best 1
men 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
men 1
to 1
back 1
us 1
up 1
felt 1
strangely 1
small 1
as 1
we 1
came 1
forward 1
somel 1
and 1
zava 1
and 1
moadine 1
were 1
on 1
hand 1
we 1
were 1
thankful 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
too 1
they 1
seemed 1
almost 1
like 1
relatives 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
splendid 1
procession 1
wreathing 1
dances 1
the 1
new 1
anthem 1
i 1
spoke 1
of 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
great 1
place 1
pulsed 1
with 1
feeling 1
the 1
deep 1
awe 1
the 1
sweet 1
hope 1
the 1
wondering 1
expectation 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
miracle 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
nothing 1
like 1
this 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
since 1
our 1
motherhood 1
began 1
somel 1
said 1
softly 1
to 1
me 1
while 1
we 1
watched 1
the 1
symbolic 1
marches 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
dawn 1
of 1
a 1
new 1
era 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
much 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
us 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
only 1
fatherhood 1
that 1
marvelous 1
dual 1
parentage 1
to 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
strangers 1
the 1
miracle 1
of 1
union 1
in 1
life 1
giving 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
brotherhood 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
you 1
join 1
us 1
to 1
our 1
kind 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
strange 1
lands 1
and 1
peoples 1
we 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
we 1
hope 1
to 1
know 1
them 1
to 1
love 1
and 1
help 1
them 1
and 1
to 1
learn 1
of 1
them 1
ah 1
you 1
cannot 1
know 1
thousands 1
of 1
voices 1
rose 1
in 1
the 1
soaring 1
climax 1
of 1
that 1
great 1
hymn 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
life 1
by 1
the 1
great 1
altar 1
of 1
motherhood 1
with 1
its 1
crown 1
of 1
fruit 1
and 1
flowers 1
stood 1
a 1
new 1
one 1
crowned 1
as 1
well 1
before 1
the 1
great 1
over 1
mother 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
her 1
ring 1
of 1
high 1
temple 1
counsellors 1
before 1
that 1
vast 1
multitude 1
of 1
calm 1
faced 1
mothers 1
and 1
holy 1
eyed 1
maidens 1
came 1
forward 1
our 1
own 1
three 1
chosen 1
ones 1
and 1
we 1
three 1
men 1
alone 1
in 1
all 1
that 1
land 1
joined 1
hands 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
made 1
our 1
marriage 1
vows 1
chapter 1
11 1
our 1
difficulties 1
we 1
say 1
marriage 1
is 1
a 1
lottery 1
also 1
marriages 1
are 1
made 1
in 1
heaven 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
widely 1
accepted 1
as 1
the 1
other 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
well 1
founded 1
theory 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
best 1
to 1
marry 1
in 1
one 1
s 1
class 1
and 1
certain 1
well 1
grounded 1
suspicions 1
of 1
international 1
marriages 1
which 1
seem 1
to 1
persist 1
in 1
the 1
interests 1
of 1
social 1
progress 1
rather 1
than 1
in 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
contracting 1
parties 1
but 1
no 1
combination 1
of 1
alien 1
races 1
of 1
color 1
of 1
caste 1
or 1
creed 1
was 1
ever 1
so 1
basically 1
difficult 1
to 1
establish 1
as 1
that 1
between 1
us 1
three 1
modern 1
american 1
men 1
and 1
these 1
three 1
women 1
of 1
herland 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
very 1
well 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
frank 1
about 1
it 1
beforehand 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
frank 1
we 1
had 1
discussed 1
at 1
least 1
ellador 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
conditions 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
adventure 1
and 1
thought 1
the 1
path 1
was 1
clear 1
before 1
us 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
things 1
one 1
takes 1
for 1
granted 1
supposes 1
are 1
mutually 1
understood 1
and 1
to 1
which 1
both 1
parties 1
may 1
repeatedly 1
refer 1
without 1
ever 1
meaning 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
the 1
differences 1
in 1
the 1
education 1
of 1
the 1
average 1
man 1
and 1
woman 1
are 1
great 1
enough 1
but 1
the 1
trouble 1
they 1
make 1
is 1
not 1
mostly 1
for 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
generally 1
carries 1
out 1
his 1
own 1
views 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
the 1
woman 1
may 1
have 1
imagined 1
the 1
conditions 1
of 1
married 1
life 1
to 1
be 1
different 1
but 1
what 1
she 1
imagined 1
was 1
ignorant 1
of 1
or 1
might 1
have 1
preferred 1
did 1
not 1
seriously 1
matter 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
clearly 1
and 1
speak 1
calmly 1
about 1
this 1
now 1
writing 1
after 1
a 1
lapse 1
of 1
years 1
years 1
full 1
of 1
growth 1
and 1
education 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
rather 1
hard 1
sledding 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
especially 1
for 1
terry 1
poor 1
terry 1
you 1
see 1
in 1
any 1
other 1
imaginable 1
marriage 1
among 1
the 1
peoples 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
whether 1
the 1
woman 1
were 1
black 1
red 1
yellow 1
brown 1
or 1
white 1
whether 1
she 1
were 1
ignorant 1
or 1
educated 1
submissive 1
or 1
rebellious 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
behind 1
her 1
the 1
marriage 1
tradition 1
of 1
our 1
general 1
history 1
this 1
tradition 1
relates 1
the 1
woman 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
goes 1
on 1
with 1
his 1
business 1
and 1
she 1
adapts 1
herself 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
to 1
it 1
even 1
in 1
citizenship 1
by 1
some 1
strange 1
hocus 1
pocus 1
that 1
fact 1
of 1
birth 1
and 1
geography 1
was 1
waved 1
aside 1
and 1
the 1
woman 1
automatically 1
acquired 1
the 1
nationality 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
well 1
here 1
were 1
we 1
three 1
aliens 1
in 1
this 1
land 1
of 1
women 1
it 1
was 1
small 1
in 1
area 1
and 1
the 1
external 1
differences 1
were 1
not 1
so 1
great 1
as 1
to 1
astound 1
us 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
yet 1
appreciate 1
the 1
differences 1
between 1
the 1
race 1
mind 1
of 1
this 1
people 1
and 1
ours 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
pure 1
stock 1
of 1
two 1
thousand 1
uninterrupted 1
years 1
where 1
we 1
have 1
some 1
long 1
connected 1
lines 1
of 1
thought 1
and 1
feeling 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
wide 1
range 1
of 1
differences 1
often 1
irreconcilable 1
these 1
people 1
were 1
smoothly 1
and 1
firmly 1
agreed 1
on 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
basic 1
principles 1
of 1
their 1
life 1
and 1
not 1
only 1
agreed 1
in 1
principle 1
but 1
accustomed 1
for 1
these 1
sixty 1
odd 1
generations 1
to 1
act 1
on 1
those 1
principles 1
this 1
is 1
one 1
thing 1
which 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
had 1
made 1
no 1
allowance 1
for 1
when 1
in 1
our 1
pre 1
marital 1
discussions 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
dear 1
girls 1
had 1
said 1
we 1
understand 1
it 1
thus 1
and 1
thus 1
or 1
we 1
hold 1
such 1
and 1
such 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
we 1
men 1
in 1
our 1
own 1
deep 1
seated 1
convictions 1
of 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
our 1
easy 1
views 1
about 1
beliefs 1
and 1
principles 1
fondly 1
imagined 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
convince 1
them 1
otherwise 1
what 1
we 1
imagined 1
before 1
marriage 1
did 1
not 1
matter 1
any 1
more 1
than 1
what 1
an 1
average 1
innocent 1
young 1
girl 1
imagines 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
facts 1
to 1
be 1
different 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
love 1
us 1
they 1
did 1
deeply 1
and 1
warmly 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
you 1
again 1
what 1
they 1
meant 1
by 1
love 1
and 1
what 1
we 1
meant 1
by 1
love 1
were 1
so 1
different 1
perhaps 1
it 1
seems 1
rather 1
cold 1
blooded 1
to 1
say 1
we 1
and 1
they 1
as 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
separate 1
couples 1
with 1
our 1
separate 1
joys 1
and 1
sorrows 1
but 1
our 1
positions 1
as 1
aliens 1
drove 1
us 1
together 1
constantly 1
the 1
whole 1
strange 1
experience 1
had 1
made 1
our 1
friendship 1
more 1
close 1
and 1
intimate 1
than 1
it 1
would 1
ever 1
have 1
become 1
in 1
a 1
free 1
and 1
easy 1
lifetime 1
among 1
our 1
own 1
people 1
also 1
as 1
men 1
with 1
our 1
masculine 1
tradition 1
of 1
far 1
more 1
than 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
we 1
were 1
a 1
unit 1
small 1
but 1
firm 1
against 1
this 1
far 1
larger 1
unit 1
of 1
feminine 1
tradition 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
can 1
make 1
clear 1
the 1
points 1
of 1
difference 1
without 1
a 1
too 1
painful 1
explicitness 1
the 1
more 1
external 1
disagreement 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
the 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
housekeeping 1
duties 1
and 1
pleasures 1
we 1
by 1
instinct 1
and 1
long 1
education 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
inherently 1
appropriate 1
to 1
women 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
two 1
illustrations 1
one 1
away 1
up 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
away 1
down 1
to 1
show 1
how 1
completely 1
disappointed 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
this 1
regard 1
for 1
the 1
lower 1
one 1
try 1
to 1
imagine 1
a 1
male 1
ant 1
coming 1
from 1
some 1
state 1
of 1
existence 1
where 1
ants 1
live 1
in 1
pairs 1
endeavoring 1
to 1
set 1
up 1
housekeeping 1
with 1
a 1
female 1
ant 1
from 1
a 1
highly 1
developed 1
anthill 1
this 1
female 1
ant 1
might 1
regard 1
him 1
with 1
intense 1
personal 1
affection 1
but 1
her 1
ideas 1
of 1
parentage 1
and 1
economic 1
management 1
would 1
be 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
scale 1
from 1
his 1
now 1
of 1
course 1
if 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
stray 1
female 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
of 1

he 1
might 1
have 1
had 1
his 1
way 1

a 1
devoted 1
and 1
impassioned 1

angel 1
accustomed 1
to 1
fulfilling 1
divine 1
missions 1
all 1
over 1
interstellar 1
space 1
this 1
angel 1
might 1
love 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
an 1
affection 1
quite 1
beyond 1
his 1
power 1
of 1
return 1
or 1
even 1
of 1
appreciation 1
but 1
her 1
ideas 1
of 1
service 1
and 1
duty 1
would 1
be 1
on 1
a 1
very 1

in 1
a 1
black 1
fury 1
for 1
which 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
some 1
sympathy 1
preferred 1
the 1
ant 1
simile 1
more 1
of 1
terry 1
and 1
his 1
special 1
troubles 1
later 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
on 1
terry 1
jeff 1
well 1
jeff 1
always 1
had 1
a 1
streak 1
that 1
was 1
too 1
good 1
for 1
this 1
world 1
he 1
s 1
the 1
kind 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
saintly 1
priest 1
in 1
parentagearlier 1
times 1
he 1
accepted 1
the 1
angel 1
theory 1
swallowed 1
it 1
whole 1
tried 1
to 1
force 1
it 1
on 1
us 1
with 1
varying 1
effect 1
he 1
so 1
worshipped 1
celis 1
and 1
not 1
only 1
celis 1
but 1
what 1
she 1
represented 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
so 1
deeply 1
convinced 1
of 1
the 1
almost 1
supernatural 1
advantages 1
of 1
this 1
country 1
and 1
people 1
that 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
medicine 1
like 1
a 1
i 1
cannot 1
say 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
but 1
more 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
wasn 1
t 1
one 1
don 1
t 1
misunderstand 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
dear 1
old 1
jeff 1
was 1
no 1
milksop 1
or 1
molly 1
coddle 1
either 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
strong 1
brave 1
efficient 1
man 1
and 1
an 1
excellent 1
fighter 1
when 1
fighting 1
was 1
necessary 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
always 1
this 1
angel 1
streak 1
in 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
rather 1
a 1
wonder 1
terry 1
being 1
so 1
different 1
that 1
he 1
really 1
loved 1
jeff 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
but 1
it 1
happens 1
so 1
sometimes 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
difference 1
perhaps 1
because 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
for 1
me 1
i 1
stood 1
between 1
i 1
was 1
no 1
such 1
gay 1
lothario 1
as 1
terry 1
and 1
no 1
such 1
galahad 1
as 1
jeff 1
but 1
for 1
all 1
my 1
limitations 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
using 1
my 1
brains 1
in 1
regard 1
to 1
behavior 1
rather 1
more 1
frequently 1
than 1
either 1
of 1
them 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
use 1
brain 1
power 1
now 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
big 1
point 1
at 1
issue 1
between 1
us 1
and 1
our 1
wives 1
was 1
as 1
may 1
easily 1
be 1
imagined 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
relation 1
wives 1
don 1
t 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
about 1
wives 1
stormed 1
terry 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
word 1
means 1
which 1
is 1
exactly 1
the 1
fact 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
how 1
could 1
they 1
back 1
in 1
their 1
prehistoric 1
records 1
of 1
polygamy 1
and 1
slavery 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
ideals 1
of 1
wifehood 1
as 1
we 1
know 1
it 1
and 1
since 1
then 1
no 1
possibility 1
of 1
forming 1
such 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
they 1
can 1
think 1
of 1
about 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
fatherhood 1
said 1
terry 1
in 1
high 1
scorn 1
fatherhood 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
was 1
always 1
wanting 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
father 1
this 1
also 1
was 1
correct 1
they 1
had 1
their 1
long 1
wide 1
deep 1
rich 1
experience 1
of 1
motherhood 1
and 1
their 1
only 1
perception 1
of 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
a 1
male 1
creature 1
as 1
such 1
was 1
for 1
fatherhood 1
aside 1
from 1
that 1
of 1
course 1
was 1
the 1
whole 1
range 1
of 1
personal 1
love 1
love 1
which 1
as 1
jeff 1
earnestly 1
phrased 1
it 1
passeth 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
women 1
it 1
did 1
too 1
i 1
can 1
give 1
no 1
idea 1
either 1
now 1
after 1
long 1
and 1
happy 1
experience 1
of 1
it 1
or 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
measureless 1
wonder 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
and 1
power 1
of 1
the 1
love 1
they 1
gave 1
us 1
even 1
alima 1
who 1
had 1
a 1
more 1
stormy 1
temperament 1
than 1
either 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
and 1
who 1
heaven 1
knows 1
had 1
far 1
more 1
provocation 1
even 1
alima 1
was 1
patience 1
and 1
tenderness 1
and 1
wisdom 1
personified 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
she 1
loved 1
until 1
he 1
but 1
i 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
to 1
that 1
yet 1
these 1
as 1
terry 1
put 1
it 1
alleged 1
or 1
so 1
called 1
wives 1
of 1
ours 1
went 1
right 1
on 1
with 1
their 1
profession 1
as 1
foresters 1
we 1
having 1
no 1
special 1
learnings 1
had 1
long 1
since 1
qualified 1
as 1
assistants 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
if 1
only 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
work 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
be 1
playing 1
forever 1
this 1
kept 1
us 1
out 1
of 1
doors 1
with 1
those 1
dear 1
girls 1
and 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
together 1
too 1
much 1
together 1
sometimes 1
these 1
people 1
had 1
it 1
now 1
became 1
clear 1
to 1
us 1
the 1
highest 1
keenest 1
most 1
delicate 1
sense 1
of 1
personal 1
privacy 1
but 1
not 1
the 1
faintest 1
idea 1
of 1
that 1
solitude 1
a 1
deux 1
we 1
are 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
they 1
had 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
two 1
rooms 1
and 1
a 1
bath 1
theory 1
realized 1
from 1
earliest 1
childhood 1
each 1
had 1
a 1
separate 1
bedroom 1
with 1
toilet 1
conveniences 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
coming 1
of 1
age 1
was 1
the 1
addition 1
of 1
an 1
outer 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
to 1
receive 1
friends 1
long 1
since 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
our 1
own 1
two 1
rooms 1
apiece 1
and 1
as 1
being 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
sex 1
and 1
race 1
these 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
separate 1
house 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
recognized 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
breathe 1
easier 1
if 1
able 1
to 1
free 1
our 1
minds 1
in 1
real 1
seclusion 1
for 1
food 1
we 1
either 1
went 1
to 1
any 1
convenient 1
eating 1
house 1
ordered 1
a 1
meal 1
brought 1
in 1
or 1
took 1
it 1
with 1
us 1
to 1
the 1
woods 1
always 1
and 1
equally 1
good 1
all 1
this 1
we 1
had 1
become 1
used 1
to 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
in 1
our 1
courting 1
days 1
after 1
marriage 1
there 1
arose 1
in 1
us 1
a 1
somewhat 1
unexpected 1
urge 1
of 1
feeling 1
that 1
called 1
for 1
a 1
separate 1
house 1
but 1
this 1
feeling 1
found 1
no 1
response 1
in 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
those 1
fair 1
ladies 1
we 1
are 1
alone 1
dear 1
ellador 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
gentle 1
patience 1
we 1
are 1
alone 1
in 1
these 1
great 1
forests 1
we 1
may 1
go 1
and 1
eat 1
in 1
any 1
little 1
summer 1
house 1
just 1
we 1
two 1
or 1
have 1
a 1
separate 1
table 1
anywhere 1
or 1
even 1
have 1
a 1
separate 1
meal 1
in 1
our 1
own 1
rooms 1
how 1
could 1
we 1
be 1
aloner 1
this 1
was 1
all 1
very 1
true 1
we 1
had 1
our 1
pleasant 1
mutual 1
solitude 1
about 1
our 1
work 1
and 1
our 1
pleasant 1
evening 1
talks 1
in 1
their 1
apartments 1
or 1
ours 1
we 1
had 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
all 1
the 1
pleasures 1
of 1
courtship 1
carried 1
right 1
on 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
sense 1
of 1
perhaps 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
called 1
possession 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
not 1
be 1
married 1
at 1
all 1
growled 1
terry 1
they 1
only 1
got 1
up 1
that 1
ceremony 1
to 1
please 1
us 1
please 1
jeff 1
mostly 1
they 1
ve 1
no 1
real 1
idea 1
of 1
being 1
married 1
i 1
tried 1
my 1
best 1
to 1
get 1
ellador 1
s 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
and 1
naturally 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
mine 1
of 1
course 1
what 1
we 1
as 1
men 1
wanted 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
see 1
was 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
other 1
and 1
as 1
we 1
proudly 1
said 1
higher 1
uses 1
in 1
this 1
relation 1
than 1
what 1
terry 1
called 1
mere 1
parentage 1
in 1
the 1
highest 1
terms 1
i 1
knew 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
explain 1
this 1
to 1
ellador 1
anything 1
higher 1
than 1
for 1
mutual 1
love 1
to 1
hope 1
to 1
give 1
life 1
as 1
we 1
did 1
she 1
said 1
how 1
is 1
it 1
higher 1
it 1
develops 1
love 1
i 1
explained 1
all 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
beautiful 1
permanent 1
mated 1
love 1
comes 1
through 1
this 1
higher 1
development 1
are 1
you 1
sure 1
she 1
asked 1
gently 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
developed 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
birds 1
who 1
love 1
each 1
other 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
mope 1
and 1
pine 1
if 1
separated 1
and 1
never 1
pair 1
again 1
if 1
one 1
dies 1
but 1
they 1
never 1
mate 1
except 1
in 1
the 1
mating 1
season 1
among 1
your 1
people 1
do 1
you 1
find 1
high 1
and 1
lasting 1
affection 1
appearing 1
in 1
proportion 1
to 1
this 1
indulgence 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
awkward 1
thing 1
sometimes 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
logical 1
mind 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
knew 1
about 1
those 1
monogamous 1
birds 1
and 1
beasts 1
too 1
that 1
mate 1
for 1
life 1
and 1
show 1
every 1
sign 1
of 1
mutual 1
affection 1
without 1
ever 1
having 1
stretched 1
the 1
sex 1
relationship 1
beyond 1
its 1
original 1
range 1
but 1
what 1
of 1
it 1
those 1
are 1
lower 1
forms 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
protested 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
capacity 1
for 1
faithful 1
and 1
affectionate 1
and 1
apparently 1
happy 1
but 1
oh 1
my 1
dear 1
my 1
dear 1
what 1
can 1
they 1
know 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
love 1
as 1
draws 1
us 1
together 1
why 1
to 1
touch 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
near 1
you 1
to 1
come 1
closer 1
and 1
closer 1
to 1
lose 1
myself 1
in 1
you 1
surely 1
you 1
feel 1
it 1
too 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
i 1
came 1
nearer 1
i 1
seized 1
her 1
hands 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
on 1
mine 1
tender 1
radiant 1
but 1
steady 1
and 1
strong 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
so 1
powerful 1
so 1
large 1
and 1
changeless 1
in 1
those 1
eyes 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sweep 1
her 1
off 1
her 1
feet 1
by 1
my 1
own 1
emotion 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
unconsciously 1
assumed 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
case 1
it 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
as 1
one 1
might 1
imagine 1
a 1
man 1
might 1
feel 1
who 1
loved 1
a 1
goddess 1
not 1
a 1
venus 1
though 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
resent 1
my 1
attitude 1
did 1
not 1
repel 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
fear 1
it 1
evidently 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
shade 1
of 1
that 1
timid 1
withdrawal 1
or 1
pretty 1
resistance 1
which 1
are 1
so 1
provocative 1
you 1
see 1
dearest 1
she 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
patient 1
with 1
us 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
like 1
the 1
women 1
of 1
your 1
country 1
we 1
are 1
mothers 1
and 1
we 1
are 1
people 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
specialized 1
in 1
this 1
line 1
we 1
and 1
we 1
and 1
we 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
hard 1
to 1
get 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
personal 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
suddenly 1
remembered 1
how 1
we 1
were 1
always 1
criticizing 1
our 1
women 1
for 1
being 1
so 1
personal 1
then 1
i 1
did 1
my 1
earnest 1
best 1
to 1
picture 1
to 1
her 1
the 1
sweet 1
intense 1
joy 1
of 1
married 1
lovers 1
and 1
the 1
result 1
in 1
higher 1
stimulus 1
to 1
all 1
creative 1
work 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
she 1
asked 1
quite 1
calmly 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
holding 1
her 1
cool 1
firm 1
hands 1
in 1
my 1
hot 1
and 1
rather 1
quivering 1
ones 1
that 1
with 1
you 1
when 1
people 1
marry 1
they 1
go 1
right 1
on 1
doing 1
this 1
in 1
season 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
season 1
with 1
no 1
thought 1
of 1
children 1
at 1
all 1
they 1
do 1
i 1
said 1
with 1
some 1
bitterness 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
mere 1
parents 1
they 1
are 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
and 1
they 1
love 1
each 1
other 1
how 1
long 1
asked 1
ellador 1
rather 1
unexpectedly 1
how 1
long 1
i 1
repeated 1
a 1
little 1
dashed 1
why 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
live 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
very 1
beautiful 1
in 1
the 1
idea 1
she 1
admitted 1
still 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
discussing 1
life 1
on 1
mars 1
this 1
climactic 1
expression 1
which 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
life 1
forms 1
has 1
but 1
the 1
one 1
purpose 1
has 1
with 1
you 1
become 1
specialized 1
to 1
higher 1
purer 1
nobler 1
uses 1
it 1
has 1
i 1
judge 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
ennobling 1
effect 1
on 1
character 1
people 1
marry 1
not 1
only 1
for 1
parentage 1
but 1
for 1
this 1
exquisite 1
interchange 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
result 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
world 1
full 1
of 1
continuous 1
lovers 1
ardent 1
happy 1
mutually 1
devoted 1
always 1
living 1
on 1
that 1
high 1
tide 1
of 1
supreme 1
emotion 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
supposed 1
to 1
belong 1
only 1
to 1
one 1
season 1
and 1
one 1
use 1
and 1
you 1
say 1
it 1
has 1
other 1
results 1
stimulating 1
all 1
high 1
creative 1
work 1
that 1
must 1
mean 1
floods 1
oceans 1
of 1
such 1
work 1
blossoming 1
from 1
this 1
intense 1
happiness 1
of 1
every 1
married 1
pair 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
beautiful 1
idea 1
she 1
was 1
silent 1
thinking 1
so 1
was 1
i 1
she 1
slipped 1
one 1
hand 1
free 1
and 1
was 1
stroking 1
my 1
hair 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
gentle 1
motherly 1
way 1
i 1
bowed 1
my 1
hot 1
head 1
on 1
her 1
shoulder 1
and 1
felt 1
a 1
dim 1
sense 1
of 1
peace 1
a 1
restfulness 1
which 1
was 1
very 1
pleasant 1
you 1
must 1
take 1
me 1
there 1
someday 1
darling 1
she 1
was 1
saying 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
so 1
much 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
your 1
country 1
your 1
people 1
your 1
mother 1
she 1
paused 1
reverently 1
oh 1
how 1
i 1
shall 1
love 1
your 1
mother 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
in 1
love 1
many 1
times 1
my 1
experience 1
did 1
not 1
compare 1
with 1
terry 1
s 1
but 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
was 1
so 1
different 1
from 1
this 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
perplexed 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
mixed 1
feelings 1
partly 1
a 1
growing 1
sense 1
of 1
common 1
ground 1
between 1
us 1
a 1
pleasant 1
rested 1
calm 1
feeling 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
imagined 1
could 1
only 1
be 1
attained 1
in 1
one 1
way 1
and 1
partly 1
a 1
bewildered 1
resentment 1
because 1
what 1
i 1
found 1
was 1
not 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
looked 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
their 1
confounded 1
psychology 1
here 1
they 1
were 1
with 1
this 1
profound 1
highly 1
developed 1
system 1
of 1
education 1
so 1
bred 1
into 1
them 1
that 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
teachers 1
by 1
profession 1
they 1
all 1
had 1
a 1
general 1
proficiency 1
in 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
second 1
nature 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
no 1
child 1
stormily 1
demanding 1
a 1
cookie 1
between 1
meals 1
was 1
ever 1
more 1
subtly 1
diverted 1
into 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
house 1
building 1
than 1
was 1
i 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
an 1
apparently 1
imperative 1
demand 1
had 1
disappeared 1
without 1
my 1
noticing 1
it 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
those 1
tender 1
mother 1
eyes 1
those 1
keen 1
scientific 1
eyes 1
noting 1
every 1
condition 1
and 1
circumstance 1
and 1
learning 1
how 1
to 1
take 1
time 1
by 1
the 1
forelock 1
and 1
avoid 1
discussion 1
before 1
occasion 1
arose 1
i 1
was 1
amazed 1
at 1
the 1
results 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
much 1
very 1
much 1
of 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
honestly 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
physiological 1
necessity 1
was 1
a 1
psychological 1
necessity 1
or 1
so 1
believed 1
i 1
found 1
after 1
my 1
ideas 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
essential 1
had 1
changed 1
that 1
my 1
feelings 1
changed 1
also 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
i 1
found 1
this 1
a 1
factor 1
of 1
enormous 1
weight 1
these 1
women 1
were 1
not 1
provocative 1
that 1
made 1
an 1
immense 1
difference 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
terry 1
had 1
so 1
complained 1
of 1
when 1
we 1
first 1
came 1
that 1
they 1
weren 1
t 1
feminine 1
they 1
lacked 1
charm 1
now 1
became 1
a 1
great 1
comfort 1
their 1
vigorous 1
beauty 1
was 1
an 1
aesthetic 1
pleasure 1
not 1
an 1
irritant 1
their 1
dress 1
and 1
ornaments 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
the 1
come 1
and 1
find 1
me 1
element 1
even 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
ellador 1
my 1
wife 1
who 1
had 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
unveiled 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
heart 1
and 1
faced 1
the 1
strange 1
new 1
hope 1
and 1
joy 1
of 1
dual 1
parentage 1
she 1
afterward 1
withdrew 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
same 1
good 1
comrade 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
at 1
first 1
they 1
were 1
women 1
plus 1
and 1
so 1
much 1
plus 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
choose 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
womanness 1
appear 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
anywhere 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
for 1
me 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
made 1
appeal 1
to 1
her 1
sympathies 1
i 1
came 1
up 1
against 1
another 1
immovable 1
wall 1
she 1
was 1
sorry 1
honestly 1
sorry 1
for 1
my 1
distresses 1
and 1
made 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
thoughtful 1
suggestions 1
often 1
quite 1
useful 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
wise 1
foresight 1
i 1
have 1
mentioned 1
above 1
which 1
often 1
saved 1
all 1
difficulty 1
before 1
it 1
arose 1
but 1
her 1
sympathy 1
did 1
not 1
alter 1
her 1
convictions 1
if 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
right 1
and 1
necessary 1
i 1
could 1
perhaps 1
bring 1
myself 1
to 1
it 1
for 1
your 1
sake 1
dear 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
mere 1
submission 1
would 1
you 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
high 1
romantic 1
love 1
you 1
spoke 1
of 1
surely 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
adjust 1
your 1
highly 1
specialized 1
faculties 1
to 1
our 1
unspecialized 1
ones 1
confound 1
it 1
i 1
hadn 1
t 1
married 1
the 1
nation 1
and 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
so 1
but 1
she 1
only 1
smiled 1
at 1
her 1
own 1
limitations 1
and 1
explained 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
think 1
in 1
we 1
s 1
confound 1
it 1
again 1
here 1
i 1
d 1
have 1
all 1
my 1
energies 1
focused 1
on 1
one 1
wish 1
and 1
before 1
i 1
knew 1
it 1
she 1
d 1
have 1
them 1
dissipated 1
in 1
one 1
direction 1
or 1
another 1
some 1
subject 1
of 1
discussion 1
that 1
began 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
point 1
i 1
was 1
talking 1
about 1
and 1
ended 1
miles 1
away 1
it 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
imagined 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
just 1
repelled 1
ignored 1
left 1
to 1
cherish 1
a 1
grievance 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
my 1
happiness 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
a 1
larger 1
sweeter 1
womanhood 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
imagined 1
before 1
our 1
marriage 1
my 1
own 1
ardor 1
had 1
perhaps 1
blinded 1
me 1
to 1
much 1
of 1
this 1
i 1
was 1
madly 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
what 1
was 1
there 1
as 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
there 1
now 1
i 1
found 1
an 1
endlessly 1
beautiful 1
undiscovered 1
country 1
to 1
explore 1
and 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
sweetest 1
wisdom 1
and 1
understanding 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
some 1
new 1
place 1
and 1
people 1
with 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
eat 1
at 1
all 1
hours 1
and 1
no 1
other 1
interests 1
in 1
particular 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
my 1
hosts 1
instead 1
of 1
merely 1
saying 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
eat 1
had 1
presently 1
aroused 1
in 1
me 1
a 1
lively 1
desire 1
for 1
music 1
for 1
pictures 1
for 1
games 1
for 1
exercise 1
for 1
playing 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
for 1
running 1
some 1
ingenious 1
machine 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
my 1
satisfactions 1
i 1
forgot 1
the 1
one 1
point 1
which 1
was 1
not 1
satisfied 1
and 1
got 1
along 1
very 1
well 1
until 1
mealtime 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
cleverest 1
and 1
most 1
ingenious 1
of 1
these 1
tricks 1
was 1
only 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
many 1
years 1
after 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
so 1
wholly 1
at 1
one 1
on 1
this 1
subject 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
laugh 1
at 1
my 1
own 1
predicament 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
you 1
see 1
with 1
us 1
women 1
are 1
kept 1
as 1
different 1
as 1
possible 1
and 1
as 1
feminine 1
as 1
possible 1
we 1
men 1
have 1
our 1
own 1
world 1
with 1
only 1
men 1
in 1
it 1
we 1
get 1
tired 1
of 1
our 1
ultra 1
maleness 1
and 1
turn 1
gladly 1
to 1
the 1
ultra 1
femaleness 1
also 1
in 1
keeping 1
our 1
women 1
as 1
feminine 1
as 1
possible 1
we 1
see 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
when 1
we 1
turn 1
to 1
them 1
we 1
find 1
the 1
thing 1
we 1
want 1
always 1
in 1
evidence 1
well 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
of 1
this 1
place 1
was 1
anything 1
but 1
seductive 1
the 1
very 1
numbers 1
of 1
these 1
human 1
women 1
always 1
in 1
human 1
relation 1
made 1
them 1
anything 1
but 1
alluring 1
when 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
this 1
my 1
hereditary 1
instincts 1
and 1
race 1
traditions 1
made 1
me 1
long 1
for 1
the 1
feminine 1
response 1
in 1
ellador 1
instead 1
of 1
withdrawing 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
want 1
her 1
more 1
she 1
deliberately 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
her 1
society 1
always 1
de 1
feminized 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
it 1
was 1
awfully 1
funny 1
really 1
here 1
was 1
i 1
with 1
an 1
ideal 1
in 1
mind 1
for 1
which 1
i 1
hotly 1
longed 1
and 1
here 1
was 1
she 1
deliberately 1
obtruding 1
in 1
the 1
foreground 1
of 1
my 1
consciousness 1
a 1
fact 1
a 1
fact 1
which 1
i 1
coolly 1
enjoyed 1
but 1
which 1
actually 1
interfered 1
with 1
what 1
i 1
wanted 1
i 1
see 1
now 1
clearly 1
enough 1
why 1
a 1
certain 1
kind 1
of 1
man 1
like 1
sir 1
almroth 1
wright 1
resents 1
the 1
professional 1
development 1
of 1
women 1
it 1
gets 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
the 1
sex 1
ideal 1
it 1
temporarily 1
covers 1
and 1
excludes 1
femininity 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
fond 1
of 1
ellador 1
my 1
friend 1
of 1
ellador 1
my 1
professional 1
companion 1
that 1
i 1
necessarily 1
enjoyed 1
her 1
society 1
on 1
any 1
terms 1
only 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
had 1
her 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
her 1
de 1
feminine 1
capacity 1
for 1
a 1
sixteen 1
hour 1
day 1
i 1
could 1
go 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
room 1
and 1
sleep 1
without 1
dreaming 1
about 1
her 1
the 1
witch 1
if 1
ever 1
anybody 1
worked 1
to 1
woo 1
and 1
win 1
and 1
hold 1
a 1
human 1
soul 1
she 1
did 1
great 1
superwoman 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
i 1
couldn 1
t 1
then 1
half 1
comprehend 1
the 1
skill 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
wonder 1
but 1
this 1
i 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
under 1
all 1
our 1
cultivated 1
attitude 1
of 1
mind 1
toward 1
women 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
older 1
deeper 1
more 1
natural 1
feeling 1
the 1
restful 1
reverence 1
which 1
looks 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
mother 1
sex 1
so 1
we 1
grew 1
together 1
in 1
friendship 1
and 1
happiness 1
ellador 1
and 1
i 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
jeff 1
and 1
celis 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
terry 1
s 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
alima 1
s 1
i 1
m 1
sorry 1
and 1
i 1
m 1
ashamed 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
blame 1
her 1
somewhat 1
she 1
wasn 1
t 1
as 1
fine 1
a 1
psychologist 1
as 1
ellador 1
and 1
what 1
s 1
more 1
i 1
think 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
far 1
descended 1
atavistic 1
trace 1
of 1
more 1
marked 1
femaleness 1
never 1
apparent 1
till 1
terry 1
called 1
it 1
out 1
but 1
when 1
all 1
is 1
said 1
it 1
doesn 1
t 1
excuse 1
him 1
i 1
hadn 1
t 1
realized 1
to 1
the 1
full 1
terry 1
s 1
character 1
i 1
couldn 1
t 1
being 1
a 1
man 1
the 1
position 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
with 1
us 1
of 1
course 1
only 1
with 1
these 1
distinctions 1
alima 1
a 1
shade 1
more 1
alluring 1
and 1
several 1
shades 1
less 1
able 1
as 1
a 1
practical 1
psychologist 1
terry 1
a 1
hundredfold 1
more 1
demanding 1
and 1
proportionately 1
less 1
reasonable 1
things 1
grew 1
strained 1
very 1
soon 1
between 1
them 1
i 1
fancy 1
at 1
first 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
together 1
in 1
her 1
great 1
hope 1
of 1
parentage 1
and 1
his 1
keen 1
joy 1
of 1
conquest 1
that 1
terry 1
was 1
inconsiderate 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
from 1
things 1
he 1
said 1
you 1
needn 1
t 1
talk 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
snapped 1
at 1
jeff 1
one 1
day 1
just 1
before 1
our 1
weddings 1
there 1
never 1
was 1
a 1
woman 1
yet 1
that 1
did 1
not 1
enjoy 1
being 1
mastered 1
all 1
your 1
pretty 1
talk 1
doesn 1
t 1
amount 1
to 1
a 1
hill 1
o 1
beans 1
i 1
know 1
and 1
terry 1
would 1
hum 1
i 1
ve 1
taken 1
my 1
fun 1
where 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
i 1
ve 1
rogued 1
and 1
i 1
ve 1
ranged 1
in 1
my 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
i 1
learned 1
from 1
the 1
yellow 1
and 1
black 1
they 1
ave 1
helped 1
me 1
a 1
eap 1
with 1
the 1
white 1
jeff 1
turned 1
sharply 1
and 1
left 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
bit 1
disquieted 1
myself 1
poor 1
old 1
terry 1
the 1
things 1
he 1
d 1
learned 1
didn 1
t 1
help 1
him 1
a 1
heap 1
in 1
herland 1
his 1
idea 1
was 1
to 1
take 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
honestly 1
believed 1
that 1
women 1
like 1
it 1
not 1
the 1
women 1
of 1
herland 1
not 1
alima 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
her 1
now 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
week 1
of 1
their 1
marriage 1
setting 1
forth 1
to 1
her 1
day 1
s 1
work 1
with 1
long 1
determined 1
strides 1
and 1
hard 1
set 1
mouth 1
and 1
sticking 1
close 1
to 1
ellador 1
she 1
didn 1
t 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
alone 1
with 1
terry 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
but 1
the 1
more 1
she 1
kept 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
the 1
more 1
he 1
wanted 1
her 1
naturally 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
tremendous 1
row 1
about 1
their 1
separate 1
establishments 1
tried 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
in 1
his 1
rooms 1
tried 1
to 1
stay 1
in 1
hers 1
but 1
there 1
she 1
drew 1
the 1
line 1
sharply 1
he 1
came 1
away 1
one 1
night 1
and 1
stamped 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
moonlit 1
road 1
swearing 1
under 1
his 1
breath 1
i 1
was 1
taking 1
a 1
walk 1
that 1
night 1
too 1
but 1
i 1
wasn 1
t 1
in 1
his 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
rage 1
you 1
d 1
not 1
have 1
believed 1
that 1
he 1
loved 1
alima 1
at 1
all 1
you 1
d 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
some 1
quarry 1
he 1
was 1
pursuing 1
something 1
to 1
catch 1
and 1
conquer 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
owing 1
to 1
all 1
those 1
differences 1
i 1
spoke 1
of 1
they 1
soon 1
lost 1
the 1
common 1
ground 1
they 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
and 1
were 1
unable 1
to 1
meet 1
sanely 1
and 1
dispassionately 1
i 1
fancy 1
too 1
this 1
is 1
pure 1
conjecture 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
succeeded 1
in 1
driving 1
alima 1
beyond 1
her 1
best 1
judgment 1
her 1
real 1
conscience 1
and 1
that 1
after 1
that 1
her 1
own 1
sense 1
of 1
shame 1
the 1
reaction 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
made 1
her 1
bitter 1
perhaps 1
they 1
quarreled 1
really 1
quarreled 1
and 1
after 1
making 1
it 1
up 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
real 1
break 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
alone 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
and 1
perhaps 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
bit 1
nervous 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
but 1
she 1
got 1
moadine 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
stay 1
next 1
door 1
to 1
her 1
also 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
sturdy 1
assistant 1
detailed 1
to 1
accompany 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
work 1
terry 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
ideas 1
as 1
i 1
ve 1
tried 1
to 1
show 1
i 1
daresay 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
do 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
perhaps 1
he 1
even 1
convinced 1
himself 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
for 1
her 1
anyhow 1
he 1
hid 1
himself 1
in 1
her 1
bedroom 1
one 1
night 1
the 1
women 1
of 1
herland 1
have 1
no 1
fear 1
of 1
men 1
why 1
should 1
they 1
have 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
timid 1
in 1
any 1
sense 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
weak 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
have 1
strong 1
trained 1
athletic 1
bodies 1
othello 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
extinguished 1
alima 1
with 1
a 1
pillow 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
a 1
mouse 1
terry 1
put 1
in 1
practice 1
his 1
pet 1
conviction 1
that 1
a 1
woman 1
loves 1
to 1
be 1
mastered 1
and 1
by 1
sheer 1
brute 1
force 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
pride 1
and 1
passion 1
of 1
his 1
intense 1
masculinity 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
master 1
this 1
woman 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
work 1
i 1
got 1
a 1
pretty 1
clear 1
account 1
of 1
it 1
later 1
from 1
ellador 1
but 1
what 1
we 1
heard 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
the 1
noise 1
of 1
a 1
tremendous 1
struggle 1
and 1
alima 1
calling 1
to 1
moadine 1
moadine 1
was 1
close 1
by 1
and 1
came 1
at 1
once 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
more 1
strong 1
grave 1
women 1
followed 1
terry 1
dashed 1
about 1
like 1
a 1
madman 1
he 1
would 1
cheerfully 1
have 1
killed 1
them 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
himself 1
but 1
he 1
couldn 1
t 1
when 1
he 1
swung 1
a 1
chair 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
one 1
sprang 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
caught 1
it 1
two 1
threw 1
themselves 1
bodily 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
forced 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
to 1
have 1
him 1
tied 1
hand 1
and 1
foot 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
sheer 1
pity 1
for 1
his 1
futile 1
rage 1
to 1
anesthetize 1
him 1
alima 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
cold 1
fury 1
she 1
wanted 1
him 1
killed 1
actually 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
trial 1
before 1
the 1
local 1
over 1
mother 1
and 1
this 1
woman 1
who 1
did 1
not 1
enjoy 1
being 1
mastered 1
stated 1
her 1
case 1
in 1
a 1
court 1
in 1
our 1
country 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
held 1
quite 1
within 1
his 1
rights 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
our 1
country 1
it 1
was 1
theirs 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
measure 1
the 1
enormity 1
of 1
the 1
offense 1
by 1
its 1
effect 1
upon 1
a 1
possible 1
fatherhood 1
and 1
he 1
scorned 1
even 1
to 1
reply 1
to 1
this 1
way 1
of 1
putting 1
it 1
he 1
did 1
let 1
himself 1
go 1
once 1
and 1
explained 1
in 1
definite 1
terms 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
incapable 1
of 1
understanding 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
needs 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
desires 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
he 1
called 1
them 1
neuters 1
epicenes 1
bloodless 1
sexless 1
creatures 1
he 1
said 1
they 1
could 1
of 1
course 1
kill 1
him 1
as 1
so 1
many 1
insects 1
could 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
despised 1
them 1
nonetheless 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
stern 1
grave 1
mothers 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
mind 1
his 1
despising 1
them 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
trial 1
and 1
many 1
interesting 1
points 1
were 1
brought 1
out 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
views 1
of 1
our 1
habits 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
terry 1
had 1
his 1
sentence 1
he 1
waited 1
grim 1
and 1
defiant 1
the 1
sentence 1
was 1
you 1
must 1
go 1
home 1
chapter 1
12 1
expelled 1
we 1
had 1
all 1
meant 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
again 1
indeed 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
meant 1
not 1
by 1
any 1
means 1
to 1
stay 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
had 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
being 1
turned 1
out 1
dismissed 1
sent 1
away 1
for 1
bad 1
conduct 1
we 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
really 1
liked 1
it 1
terry 1
said 1
he 1
did 1
he 1
professed 1
great 1
scorn 1
of 1
the 1
penalty 1
and 1
the 1
trial 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
characteristics 1
of 1
this 1
miserable 1
half 1
country 1
but 1
he 1
knew 1
and 1
we 1
knew 1
that 1
in 1
any 1
whole 1
country 1
we 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
been 1
as 1
forgivingly 1
treated 1
as 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
here 1
if 1
the 1
people 1
had 1
come 1
after 1
us 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
directions 1
we 1
left 1
there 1
d 1
have 1
been 1
quite 1
a 1
different 1
story 1
said 1
terry 1
we 1
found 1
out 1
later 1
why 1
no 1
reserve 1
party 1
had 1
arrived 1
all 1
our 1
careful 1
directions 1
had 1
been 1
destroyed 1
in 1
a 1
fire 1
we 1
might 1
have 1
all 1
died 1
there 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
at 1
home 1
have 1
ever 1
known 1
our 1
whereabouts 1
terry 1
was 1
under 1
guard 1
now 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
known 1
as 1
unsafe 1
convicted 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
to 1
them 1
an 1
unpardonable 1
sin 1
he 1
laughed 1
at 1
their 1
chill 1
horror 1
parcel 1
of 1
old 1
maids 1
he 1
called 1
them 1
they 1
re 1
all 1
old 1
maids 1
children 1
or 1
not 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
about 1
sex 1
when 1
terry 1
said 1
sex 1
sex 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
_s_ 1
he 1
meant 1
the 1
male 1
sex 1
naturally 1
its 1
special 1
values 1
its 1
profound 1
conviction 1
of 1
being 1
the 1
life 1
force 1
its 1
cheerful 1
ignoring 1
of 1
the 1
true 1
life 1
process 1
and 1
its 1
interpretation 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
sex 1
solely 1
from 1
its 1
own 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
i 1
had 1
learned 1
to 1
see 1
these 1
things 1
very 1
differently 1
since 1
living 1
with 1
ellador 1
and 1
as 1
for 1
jeff 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
thoroughly 1
herlandized 1
that 1
he 1
wasn 1
t 1
fair 1
to 1
terry 1
who 1
fretted 1
sharply 1
in 1
his 1
new 1
restraint 1
moadine 1
grave 1
and 1
strong 1
as 1
sadly 1
patient 1
as 1
a 1
mother 1
with 1
a 1
degenerate 1
child 1
kept 1
steady 1
watch 1
on 1
him 1
with 1
enough 1
other 1
women 1
close 1
at 1
hand 1
to 1
prevent 1
an 1
outbreak 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
weapons 1
and 1
well 1
knew 1
that 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
was 1
of 1
small 1
avail 1
against 1
those 1
grim 1
quiet 1
women 1
we 1
were 1
allowed 1
to 1
visit 1
him 1
freely 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
a 1
small 1
high 1
walled 1
garden 1
to 1
walk 1
in 1
while 1
the 1
preparations 1
for 1
our 1
departure 1
were 1
under 1
way 1
three 1
of 1
us 1
were 1
to 1
go 1
terry 1
because 1
he 1
must 1
i 1
because 1
two 1
were 1
safer 1
for 1
our 1
flyer 1
and 1
the 1
long 1
boat 1
trip 1
to 1
the 1
coast 1
ellador 1
because 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
without 1
her 1
if 1
jeff 1
had 1
elected 1
to 1
return 1
celis 1
would 1
have 1
gone 1
too 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
most 1
absorbed 1
of 1
lovers 1
but 1
jeff 1
had 1
no 1
desire 1
that 1
way 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
all 1
our 1
noise 1
and 1
dirt 1
our 1
vice 1
and 1
crime 1
our 1
disease 1
and 1
degeneracy 1
he 1
demanded 1
of 1
me 1
privately 1
we 1
never 1
spoke 1
like 1
that 1
before 1
the 1
women 1
i 1
wouldn 1
t 1
take 1
celis 1
there 1
for 1
anything 1
on 1
earth 1
he 1
protested 1
she 1
d 1
die 1
she 1
d 1
die 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
shame 1
to 1
see 1
our 1
slums 1
and 1
hospitals 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
risk 1
it 1
with 1
ellador 1
you 1
d 1
better 1
break 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
gently 1
before 1
she 1
really 1
makes 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
jeff 1
was 1
right 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
told 1
her 1
more 1
fully 1
than 1
i 1
did 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
hard 1
to 1
bridge 1
the 1
gulf 1
of 1
as 1
deep 1
a 1
difference 1
as 1
existed 1
between 1
our 1
life 1
and 1
theirs 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
look 1
here 1
my 1
dear 1
i 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
going 1
to 1
my 1
country 1
with 1
me 1
you 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
prepared 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
many 1
shocks 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
this 1
the 1
cities 1
i 1
mean 1
the 1
civilized 1
parts 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
wild 1
country 1
is 1
i 1
shall 1
enjoy 1
it 1
all 1
she 1
said 1
her 1
eyes 1
starry 1
with 1
hope 1
i 1
understand 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
like 1
ours 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
how 1
monotonous 1
our 1
quiet 1
life 1
must 1
seem 1
to 1
you 1
how 1
much 1
more 1
stirring 1
yours 1
must 1
be 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
like 1
the 1
biological 1
change 1
you 1
told 1
me 1
about 1
when 1
the 1
second 1
sex 1
was 1
introduced 1
a 1
far 1
greater 1
movement 1
constant 1
change 1
with 1
new 1
possibilities 1
of 1
growth 1
i 1
had 1
told 1
her 1
of 1
the 1
later 1
biological 1
theories 1
of 1
sex 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
deeply 1
convinced 1
of 1
the 1
superior 1
advantages 1
of 1
having 1
two 1
the 1
superiority 1
of 1
a 1
world 1
with 1
men 1
in 1
it 1
we 1
have 1
done 1
what 1
we 1
could 1
alone 1
perhaps 1
we 1
have 1
some 1
things 1
better 1
in 1
a 1
quiet 1
way 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
the 1
different 1
nations 1
all 1
the 1
long 1
rich 1
history 1
behind 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
wonderful 1
new 1
knowledge 1
oh 1
i 1
just 1
can 1
t 1
wait 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
what 1
could 1
i 1
do 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
in 1
so 1
many 1
words 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
our 1
unsolved 1
problems 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
dishonesty 1
and 1
corruption 1
vice 1
and 1
crime 1
disease 1
and 1
insanity 1
prisons 1
and 1
hospitals 1
and 1
it 1
made 1
no 1
more 1
impression 1
on 1
her 1
than 1
it 1
would 1
to 1
tell 1
a 1
south 1
sea 1
islander 1
about 1
the 1
temperature 1
of 1
the 1
arctic 1
circle 1
she 1
could 1
intellectually 1
see 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
bad 1
to 1
have 1
those 1
things 1
but 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
feel 1
it 1
we 1
had 1
quite 1
easily 1
come 1
to 1
accept 1
the 1
herland 1
life 1
as 1
normal 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
normal 1
none 1
of 1
us 1
make 1
any 1
outcry 1
over 1
mere 1
health 1
and 1
peace 1
and 1
happy 1
industry 1
and 1
the 1
abnormal 1
to 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
so 1
sadly 1
well 1
acclimated 1
she 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
the 1
two 1
things 1
she 1
cared 1
most 1
to 1
hear 1
about 1
and 1
wanted 1
most 1
to 1
see 1
were 1
these 1
the 1
beautiful 1
relation 1
of 1
marriage 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
women 1
who 1
were 1
mothers 1
and 1
nothing 1
else 1
beyond 1
these 1
her 1
keen 1
active 1
mind 1
hungered 1
eagerly 1
for 1
the 1
world 1
life 1
i 1
m 1
almost 1
as 1
anxious 1
to 1
go 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
yourself 1
she 1
insisted 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
be 1
desperately 1
homesick 1
i 1
assured 1
her 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
be 1
homesick 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
paradise 1
as 1
theirs 1
but 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
none 1
of 1
it 1
oh 1
yes 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
s 1
like 1
those 1
little 1
tropical 1
islands 1
you 1
ve 1
told 1
me 1
about 1
shining 1
like 1
jewels 1
in 1
the 1
big 1
blue 1
sea 1
i 1
can 1
t 1
wait 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
sea 1
the 1
little 1
island 1
may 1
be 1
as 1
perfect 1
as 1
a 1
garden 1
but 1
you 1
always 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
big 1
country 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
bad 1
in 1
some 1
ways 1
ellador 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
willing 1
but 1
the 1
nearer 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
our 1
really 1
going 1

to 1
my 1
having 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
back 1
to 1
our 1
civilization 1
after 1
the 1
clean 1
peace 1
and 1
beauty 1
of 1
theirs 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
dread 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
explain 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
homesick 1
at 1
first 1
while 1
we 1
were 1
prisoners 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
ellador 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
rather 1
idealized 1
my 1
country 1
and 1
its 1
ways 1
in 1
describing 1
it 1
also 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
accepted 1
certain 1
evils 1
as 1
integral 1
parts 1
of 1
our 1
civilization 1
and 1
never 1
dwelt 1
on 1
them 1
at 1
all 1
even 1
when 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
the 1
worst 1
i 1
never 1
remembered 1
some 1
things 1
which 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
impressed 1
her 1
at 1
once 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
never 1
impressed 1
me 1
now 1
in 1
my 1
efforts 1
at 1
explanation 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
see 1
both 1
ways 1
more 1
keenly 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
painful 1
defects 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
land 1
the 1
marvelous 1
gains 1
of 1
this 1
in 1
missing 1
men 1
we 1
three 1
visitors 1
had 1
naturally 1
missed 1
the 1
larger 1
part 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
had 1
unconsciously 1
assumed 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
miss 1
it 1
too 1
it 1
took 1
me 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
to 1
realize 1
terry 1
never 1
did 1
realize 1
how 1
little 1
it 1
meant 1
to 1
them 1
when 1
we 1
say 1
men 1
man 1
manly 1
manhood 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
masculine 1
derivatives 1
we 1
have 1
in 1
the 1
background 1
of 1
our 1
minds 1
a 1
huge 1
vague 1
crowded 1
picture 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
activities 1
to 1
grow 1
up 1
and 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
act 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
the 1
meaning 1
and 1
connotation 1
is 1
wide 1
indeed 1
that 1
vast 1
background 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
marching 1
columns 1
of 1
men 1
of 1
changing 1
lines 1
of 1
men 1
of 1
long 1
processions 1
of 1

everywhere 1

everything 1
the 1

and 1
when 1
we 1
say 1
women 1
we 1
think 1
female 1
the 1
sex 1
but 1
to 1
these 1
women 1
in 1
the 1
unbroken 1
sweep 1
of 1
this 1
two 1
thousand 1
year 1
old 1
feminine 1
civilization 1
the 1
word 1
woman 1
called 1
up 1
all 1
that 1
big 1
background 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
in 1
social 1
development 1
and 1
the 1
word 1
man 1
meant 1
to 1
them 1
only 1
male 1
the 1
sex 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
could 1
tell 1
them 1
that 1
in 1
our 1
world 1
men 1
did 1
everything 1
but 1
that 1
did 1
not 1
alter 1
the 1
background 1
of 1
their 1
minds 1
that 1
man 1
the 1
male 1
did 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
was 1
to 1
them 1
a 1
statement 1
making 1
no 1
more 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
than 1
was 1
made 1
in 1
ours 1
when 1
we 1
first 1
faced 1
the 1
astounding 1
fact 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
in 1
herland 1
women 1
were 1
the 1
world 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
living 1
there 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
year 1
we 1
had 1
learned 1
their 1
limited 1
history 1
with 1
its 1
straight 1
smooth 1
upreaching 1
lines 1
reaching 1
higher 1
and 1
going 1
faster 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
smooth 1
comfort 1
of 1
their 1
present 1
life 1
we 1
had 1
learned 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
their 1
psychology 1
a 1
much 1
wider 1
field 1
than 1
the 1
history 1
but 1
here 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
follow 1
so 1
readily 1
we 1
were 1
now 1
well 1
used 1
to 1
seeing 1
women 1
not 1
as 1
females 1
but 1
as 1
people 1
people 1
of 1
all 1
sorts 1
doing 1
every 1
kind 1
of 1
work 1
this 1
outbreak 1
of 1
terry 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
strong 1
reaction 1
against 1
it 1
gave 1
us 1
a 1
new 1
light 1
on 1
their 1
genuine 1
femininity 1
this 1
was 1
given 1
me 1
with 1
great 1
clearness 1
by 1
both 1
ellador 1
and 1
somel 1
the 1
feeling 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
sick 1
revulsion 1
and 1
horror 1
such 1
as 1
would 1
be 1
felt 1
at 1
some 1
climactic 1
blasphemy 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
faintest 1
approach 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
in 1
their 1
minds 1
knowing 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
marital 1
indulgence 1
among 1
us 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
one 1
high 1
purpose 1
of 1
motherhood 1
had 1
been 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
the 1
governing 1
law 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
contribution 1
of 1
the 1
father 1
though 1
known 1
to 1
them 1
so 1
distinctly 1
another 1
method 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
end 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
effort 1
get 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
male 1
creature 1
whose 1
desires 1
quite 1
ignore 1
parentage 1
and 1
seek 1
only 1
for 1
what 1
we 1
euphoniously 1
term 1
the 1
joys 1
of 1
love 1
when 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
tell 1
ellador 1
that 1
women 1
too 1
felt 1
so 1
with 1
us 1
she 1
drew 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
tried 1
hard 1
to 1
grasp 1
intellectually 1
what 1
she 1
could 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
sympathize 1
with 1
you 1
mean 1
that 1
with 1
you 1
love 1
between 1
man 1
and 1
woman 1
expresses 1
itself 1
in 1
that 1
way 1
without 1
regard 1
to 1
motherhood 1
to 1
parentage 1
i 1
mean 1
she 1
added 1
carefully 1
yes 1
surely 1
it 1
is 1
love 1
we 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
deep 1
sweet 1
love 1
between 1
two 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
want 1
children 1
and 1
children 1
come 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
what 1
we 1
think 1
about 1
but 1
but 1
it 1
seems 1
so 1
against 1
nature 1
she 1
said 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
creatures 1
we 1
know 1
do 1
that 1
do 1
other 1
animals 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
animals 1
i 1
replied 1
with 1
some 1
sharpness 1
at 1
least 1
we 1
are 1
something 1
more 1
something 1
higher 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
far 1
nobler 1
and 1
more 1
beautiful 1
relation 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
explained 1
before 1
your 1
view 1
seems 1
to 1
us 1
rather 1
shall 1
i 1
say 1
practical 1
prosaic 1
merely 1
a 1
means 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
with 1
us 1
oh 1
my 1
dear 1
girl 1
cannot 1
you 1
see 1
cannot 1
you 1
feel 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
last 1
sweetest 1
highest 1
consummation 1
of 1
mutual 1
love 1
she 1
was 1
impressed 1
visibly 1
she 1
trembled 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
as 1
i 1
held 1
her 1
close 1
kissing 1
her 1
hungrily 1
but 1
there 1
rose 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
that 1
look 1
i 1
knew 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
remote 1
clear 1
look 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
far 1
away 1
even 1
though 1
i 1
held 1
her 1
beautiful 1
body 1
so 1
close 1
and 1
was 1
now 1
on 1
some 1
snowy 1
mountain 1
regarding 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
i 1
feel 1
it 1
quite 1
clearly 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
deep 1
sympathy 1
with 1
what 1
you 1
feel 1
no 1
doubt 1
more 1
strongly 1
still 1
but 1
what 1
i 1
feel 1
even 1
what 1
you 1
feel 1
dearest 1
does 1
not 1
convince 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
right 1
until 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
of 1
that 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
cannot 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
wish 1
ellador 1
at 1
times 1
like 1
this 1
always 1
reminded 1
me 1
of 1
epictetus 1
i 1
will 1
put 1
you 1
in 1
prison 1
said 1
his 1
master 1
my 1
body 1
you 1
mean 1
replied 1
epictetus 1
calmly 1
i 1
will 1
cut 1
your 1
head 1
off 1
said 1
his 1
master 1
have 1
i 1
said 1
that 1
my 1
head 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
cut 1
off 1
a 1
difficult 1
person 1
epictetus 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
miracle 1
by 1
which 1
a 1
woman 1
even 1
in 1
your 1
arms 1
may 1
withdraw 1
herself 1
utterly 1
disappear 1
till 1
what 1
you 1
hold 1
is 1
as 1
inaccessible 1
as 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
cliff 1
be 1
patient 1
with 1
me 1
dear 1
she 1
urged 1
sweetly 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
hard 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
little 1
how 1
terry 1
was 1
so 1
driven 1
to 1
crime 1
oh 1
come 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
pretty 1
hard 1
word 1
for 1
it 1
after 1
all 1
alima 1
was 1
his 1
wife 1
you 1
know 1
i 1
urged 1
feeling 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
a 1
sudden 1
burst 1
of 1
sympathy 1
for 1
poor 1
terry 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
his 1
temperament 1
and 1
habits 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
unbearable 1
situation 1
but 1
ellador 1
for 1
all 1
her 1
wide 1
intellectual 1
grasp 1
and 1
the 1
broad 1
sympathy 1
in 1
which 1
their 1
religion 1
trained 1
them 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
allowance 1
for 1
such 1
to 1
her 1
sacrilegious 1
brutality 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
more 1
difficult 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
her 1
because 1
we 1
three 1
in 1
our 1
constant 1
talks 1
and 1
lectures 1
about 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
had 1
naturally 1
avoided 1
the 1
seamy 1
side 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
from 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
deceive 1
but 1
from 1
wishing 1
to 1
put 1
the 1
best 1
foot 1
foremost 1
for 1
our 1
civilization 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
and 1
comfort 1
of 1
theirs 1
also 1
we 1
really 1
thought 1
some 1
things 1
were 1
right 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
unavoidable 1
which 1
we 1
could 1
readily 1
see 1
would 1
be 1
repugnant 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
therefore 1
did 1
not 1
discuss 1
again 1
there 1
was 1
much 1
of 1
our 1
world 1
s 1
life 1
which 1
we 1
being 1
used 1
to 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
noticed 1
as 1
anything 1
worth 1
describing 1
and 1
still 1
further 1
there 1
was 1
about 1
these 1
women 1
a 1
colossal 1
innocence 1
upon 1
which 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
we 1
did 1
say 1
had 1
made 1
no 1
impression 1
whatever 1
i 1
am 1
thus 1
explicit 1
about 1
it 1
because 1
it 1
shows 1
how 1
unexpectedly 1
strong 1
was 1
the 1
impression 1
made 1
upon 1
ellador 1
when 1
she 1
at 1
last 1
entered 1
our 1
civilization 1
she 1
urged 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
patient 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
patient 1
you 1
see 1
i 1
loved 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
even 1
the 1
restrictions 1
she 1
so 1
firmly 1
established 1
left 1
me 1
much 1
happiness 1
we 1
were 1
lovers 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
surely 1
delight 1
enough 1
in 1
that 1
do 1
not 1
imagine 1
that 1
these 1
young 1
women 1
utterly 1
refused 1
the 1
great 1
new 1
hope 1
as 1
they 1
called 1
it 1
that 1
of 1
dual 1
parentage 1
for 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
agreed 1
to 1
marry 1
us 1
though 1
the 1
marrying 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
concession 1
to 1
our 1
prejudices 1
rather 1
than 1
theirs 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
process 1
was 1
the 1
holy 1
thing 1
and 1
they 1
meant 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
holy 1
but 1
so 1
far 1
only 1
celis 1
her 1
blue 1
eyes 1
swimming 1
in 1
happy 1
tears 1
her 1
heart 1
lifted 1
with 1
that 1
tide 1
of 1
race 1
motherhood 1
which 1
was 1
their 1
supreme 1
passion 1
could 1
with 1
ineffable 1
joy 1
and 1
pride 1
announce 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
mother 1
the 1
new 1
motherhood 1
they 1
called 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
country 1
knew 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
pleasure 1
no 1
service 1
no 1
honor 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
land 1
that 1
celis 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
had 1
almost 1
like 1
the 1
breathless 1
reverence 1
with 1
which 1
two 1
thousand 1
years 1
ago 1
that 1
dwindling 1
band 1
of 1
women 1
had 1
watched 1
the 1
miracle 1
of 1
virgin 1
birth 1
was 1
the 1
deep 1
awe 1
and 1
warm 1
expectancy 1
with 1
which 1
they 1
greeted 1
this 1
new 1
miracle 1
of 1
union 1
all 1
mothers 1
in 1
that 1
land 1
were 1
holy 1
to 1
them 1
for 1
long 1
ages 1
the 1
approach 1
to 1
motherhood 1
has 1
been 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
intense 1
and 1
exquisite 1
love 1
and 1
longing 1
by 1
the 1
supreme 1
desire 1
the 1
overmastering 1
demand 1
for 1
a 1
child 1
every 1
thought 1
they 1
held 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
processes 1
of 1
maternity 1
was 1
open 1
to 1
the 1
day 1
simple 1
yet 1
sacred 1
every 1
woman 1
of 1
them 1
placed 1
motherhood 1
not 1
only 1
higher 1
than 1
other 1
duties 1
but 1
so 1
far 1
higher 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
other 1
duties 1
one 1
might 1
almost 1
say 1
all 1
their 1
wide 1
mutual 1
love 1
all 1
the 1
subtle 1
interplay 1
of 1
mutual 1
friendship 1
and 1
service 1
the 1
urge 1
of 1
progressive 1
thought 1
and 1
invention 1
the 1
deepest 1
religious 1
emotion 1
every 1
feeling 1
and 1
every 1
act 1
was 1
related 1
to 1
this 1
great 1
central 1
power 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
of 1
life 1
pouring 1
through 1
them 1
which 1
made 1
them 1
the 1
bearers 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
spirit 1
of 1
god 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
i 1
learned 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
from 1
their 1
books 1
from 1
talk 1
especially 1
from 1
ellador 1
she 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
for 1
a 1
brief 1
moment 1
envious 1
of 1
her 1
friend 1
a 1
thought 1
she 1
put 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
forever 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
much 1
better 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
is 1
for 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
country 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
adventures 1
by 1
sea 1
and 1
land 1
as 1
you 1
say 1
and 1
as 1
in 1
truth 1
we 1
did 1
and 1
it 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
at 1
all 1
safe 1
for 1
a 1
baby 1
so 1
we 1
won 1
t 1
try 1
again 1
dear 1
till 1
it 1
is 1
safe 1
will 1
we 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
hard 1
saying 1
for 1
a 1
very 1
loving 1
husband 1
unless 1
she 1
went 1
on 1
if 1
one 1
is 1
coming 1
you 1
will 1
leave 1
me 1
behind 1
you 1
can 1
come 1
back 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
child 1
then 1
that 1
deep 1
ancient 1
chill 1
of 1
male 1
jealousy 1
of 1
even 1
his 1
own 1
progeny 1
touched 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
d 1
rather 1
have 1
you 1
ellador 1
than 1
all 1
the 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
d 1
rather 1
have 1
you 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
your 1
own 1
terms 1
than 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
you 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
stupid 1
saying 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
would 1
for 1
if 1
she 1
wasn 1
t 1
there 1
i 1
should 1
want 1
all 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
have 1
none 1
of 1
her 1
but 1
if 1
she 1
went 1
along 1
as 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sublimated 1
sister 1
only 1
much 1
closer 1
and 1
warmer 1
than 1
that 1
really 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
all 1
of 1
her 1
but 1
that 1
one 1
thing 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
ellador 1
s 1
friendship 1
ellador 1
s 1
comradeship 1
ellador 1
s 1
sisterly 1
affection 1
ellador 1
s 1
perfectly 1
sincere 1
love 1
none 1
the 1
less 1
deep 1
that 1
she 1
held 1
it 1
back 1
on 1
a 1
definite 1
line 1
of 1
reserve 1
were 1
enough 1
to 1
live 1
on 1
very 1
happily 1
i 1
find 1
it 1
quite 1
beyond 1
me 1
to 1
describe 1
what 1
this 1
woman 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
we 1
talk 1
fine 1
things 1
about 1
women 1
but 1
in 1
our 1
hearts 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
very 1
limited 1
beings 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
we 1
honor 1
them 1
for 1
their 1
functional 1
powers 1
even 1
while 1
we 1
dishonor 1
them 1
by 1
our 1
use 1
of 1
it 1
we 1
honor 1
them 1
for 1
their 1
carefully 1
enforced 1
virtue 1
even 1
while 1
we 1
show 1
by 1
our 1
own 1
conduct 1
how 1
little 1
we 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
virtue 1
we 1
value 1
them 1
sincerely 1
for 1
the 1
perverted 1
maternal 1
activities 1
which 1
make 1
our 1
wives 1
the 1
most 1
comfortable 1
of 1
servants 1
bound 1
to 1
us 1
for 1
life 1
with 1
the 1
wages 1
wholly 1
at 1
our 1
own 1
decision 1
their 1
whole 1
business 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
temporary 1
duties 1
of 1
such 1
motherhood 1
as 1
they 1
may 1
achieve 1
to 1
meet 1
our 1
needs 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
oh 1
we 1
value 1
them 1
all 1
right 1
in 1
their 1
place 1
which 1
place 1
is 1
the 1
home 1
where 1
they 1
perform 1
that 1
mixture 1
of 1
duties 1
so 1
ably 1
described 1
by 1
mrs 1
josephine 1
dodge 1
daskam 1
bacon 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
services 1
of 1
a 1
mistress 1
are 1
carefully 1
specified 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
clear 1
writer 1
mrs 1
j 1
d 1
d 1
bacon 1
and 1
understands 1
her 1
subject 1
from 1
her 1
own 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
but 1
that 1
combination 1
of 1
industries 1
while 1
convenient 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
economical 1
does 1
not 1
arouse 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
emotion 1
commanded 1
by 1
the 1
women 1
of 1
herland 1
these 1
were 1
women 1
one 1
had 1
to 1
love 1
up 1
very 1
high 1
up 1
instead 1
of 1
down 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
pets 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
servants 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
timid 1
inexperienced 1
weak 1
after 1
i 1
got 1
over 1
the 1
jar 1
to 1
my 1
pride 1
which 1
jeff 1
i 1
truly 1
think 1
never 1
felt 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
born 1
worshipper 1
and 1
which 1
terry 1
never 1
got 1
over 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
clear 1
in 1
his 1
ideas 1
of 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
women 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
loving 1
up 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
sensation 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
queer 1
feeling 1
way 1
down 1
deep 1
as 1
of 1
the 1
stirring 1
of 1
some 1
ancient 1
dim 1
prehistoric 1
consciousness 1
a 1
feeling 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
right 1
somehow 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
feel 1
it 1
was 1
like 1
coming 1
home 1
to 1
mother 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
the 1
underflannels 1
and 1
doughnuts 1
mother 1
the 1
fussy 1
person 1
that 1
waits 1
on 1
you 1
and 1
spoils 1
you 1
and 1
doesn 1
t 1
really 1
know 1
you 1
i 1
mean 1
the 1
feeling 1
that 1
a 1
very 1
little 1
child 1
would 1
have 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
lost 1
for 1
ever 1
so 1
long 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
getting 1
home 1
of 1
being 1
clean 1
and 1
rested 1
of 1
safety 1
and 1
yet 1
freedom 1
of 1
love 1
that 1
was 1
always 1
there 1
warm 1
like 1
sunshine 1
in 1
may 1
not 1
hot 1
like 1
a 1
stove 1
or 1
a 1
featherbed 1
a 1
love 1
that 1
didn 1
t 1
irritate 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
smother 1
i 1
looked 1
at 1
ellador 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
hadn 1
t 1
seen 1
her 1
before 1
if 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
go 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
ll 1
get 1
terry 1
to 1
the 1
coast 1
and 1
come 1
back 1
alone 1
you 1
can 1
let 1
me 1
down 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
go 1
why 1
you 1
blessed 1
wonder 1
woman 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
live 1
with 1
you 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
like 1
this 1
than 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
other 1
woman 1
i 1
ever 1
saw 1
or 1
any 1
number 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
do 1
as 1
i 1
like 1
with 1
will 1
you 1
come 1
she 1
was 1
keen 1
for 1
coming 1
so 1
the 1
plans 1
went 1
on 1
she 1
d 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
that 1
marvel 1
of 1
celis 1
s 1
but 1
terry 1
had 1
no 1
such 1
desire 1
he 1
was 1
crazy 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
it 1
made 1
him 1
sick 1
he 1
said 1
sick 1
this 1
everlasting 1
mother 1
mother 1
mothering 1
i 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
terry 1
had 1
what 1
the 1
phrenologists 1
call 1
the 1
lump 1
of 1
philoprogenitiveness 1
at 1
all 1
well 1
developed 1
morbid 1
one 1
sided 1
cripples 1
he 1
called 1
them 1
even 1
when 1
from 1
his 1
window 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
their 1
splendid 1
vigor 1
and 1
beauty 1
even 1
while 1
moadine 1
as 1
patient 1
and 1
friendly 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
never 1
helped 1
alima 1
to 1
hold 1
and 1
bind 1
him 1
sat 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
wisdom 1
and 1
serene 1
strength 1
sexless 1
epicene 1
undeveloped 1
neuters 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
bitterly 1
he 1
sounded 1
like 1
sir 1
almwroth 1
wright 1
well 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
he 1
was 1
madly 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
alima 1
really 1
more 1
so 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
before 1
and 1
their 1
tempestuous 1
courtship 1
quarrels 1
and 1
reconciliations 1
had 1
fanned 1
the 1
flame 1
and 1
then 1
when 1
he 1
sought 1
by 1
that 1
supreme 1
conquest 1
which 1
seems 1
so 1
natural 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
that 1
type 1
of 1
man 1
to 1
force 1
her 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
as 1
her 1
master 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
sturdy 1
athletic 1
furious 1
woman 1
rise 1
up 1
and 1
master 1
him 1
she 1
and 1
her 1
friends 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
wonder 1
he 1
raged 1
come 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
recall 1
a 1
similar 1
case 1
in 1
all 1
history 1
or 1
fiction 1
women 1
have 1
killed 1
themselves 1
rather 1
than 1
submit 1
to 1
outrage 1
they 1
have 1
killed 1
the 1
outrager 1
they 1
have 1
escaped 1
or 1
they 1
have 1
submitted 1
sometimes 1
seeming 1
to 1
get 1
on 1
very 1
well 1
with 1
the 1
victor 1
afterward 1
there 1
was 1
that 1
adventure 1
of 1
false 1
sextus 1
for 1
instance 1
who 1
found 1
lucrese 1
combing 1
the 1
fleece 1
under 1
the 1
midnight 1
lamp 1
he 1
threatened 1
as 1
i 1
remember 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
submit 1
he 1
would 1
slay 1
her 1
slay 1
a 1
slave 1
and 1
place 1
him 1
beside 1
her 1
and 1
say 1
he 1
found 1
him 1
there 1
a 1
poor 1
device 1
it 1
always 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
mr 1
lucretius 1
had 1
asked 1
him 1
how 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
his 1
wife 1
s 1
bedroom 1
overlooking 1
her 1
morals 1
what 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
said 1
but 1
the 1
point 1
is 1
lucrese 1
submitted 1
and 1
alima 1
didn 1
t 1
she 1
kicked 1
me 1
confided 1
the 1
embittered 1
prisoner 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
someone 1
i 1
was 1
doubled 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
she 1
jumped 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
yelled 1
for 1
this 1
old 1
harpy 1
moadine 1
couldn 1
t 1
hear 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
me 1
trussed 1
up 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
i 1
believe 1
alima 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
it 1
alone 1
he 1
added 1
with 1
reluctant 1
admiration 1
she 1
s 1
as 1
strong 1
as 1
a 1
horse 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
helpless 1
when 1
you 1
hit 1
him 1
like 1
that 1
no 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
shade 1
of 1
decency 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
grin 1
at 1
that 1
and 1
even 1
terry 1
did 1
sourly 1
he 1
wasn 1
t 1
given 1
to 1
reasoning 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
strike 1
him 1
that 1
an 1
assault 1
like 1
his 1
rather 1
waived 1
considerations 1
of 1
decency 1
i 1
d 1
give 1
a 1
year 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
alone 1
again 1
he 1
said 1
slowly 1
his 1
hands 1
clenched 1
till 1
the 1
knuckles 1
were 1
white 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
did 1
she 1
left 1
our 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
entirely 1
went 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
fir 1
forest 1
on 1
the 1
highest 1
slopes 1
and 1
stayed 1
there 1
before 1
we 1
left 1
he 1
quite 1
desperately 1
longed 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
come 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
they 1
watched 1
him 1
like 1
lynxes 1
do 1
lynxes 1
watch 1
any 1
better 1
than 1
mousing 1
cats 1
i 1
wonder 1
well 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
flyer 1
in 1
order 1
and 1
be 1
sure 1
there 1
was 1
enough 1
fuel 1
left 1
though 1
terry 1
said 1
we 1
could 1
glide 1
all 1
right 1
down 1
to 1
that 1
lake 1
once 1
we 1
got 1
started 1
we 1
d 1
have 1
gone 1
gladly 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
s 1
time 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
country 1
about 1
ellador 1
s 1
leaving 1
them 1
she 1
had 1
interviews 1
with 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
leading 1
ethicists 1
wise 1
women 1
with 1
still 1
eyes 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
the 1
teachers 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
stir 1
a 1
thrill 1
a 1
deep 1
excitement 1
everywhere 1
our 1
teaching 1
about 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
has 1
given 1
them 1
all 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
isolation 1
of 1
remoteness 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
little 1
outlying 1
sample 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
overlooked 1
and 1
forgotten 1
among 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
nations 1
we 1
had 1
called 1
it 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
nations 1
and 1
they 1
liked 1
the 1
phrase 1
immensely 1
they 1
were 1
deeply 1
aroused 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
evolution 1
indeed 1
the 1
whole 1
field 1
of 1
natural 1
science 1
drew 1
them 1
irresistibly 1
any 1
number 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
have 1
risked 1
everything 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
strange 1
unknown 1
lands 1
and 1
study 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
take 1
only 1
one 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
ellador 1
naturally 1
we 1
planned 1
greatly 1
about 1
coming 1
back 1
about 1
establishing 1
a 1
connecting 1
route 1
by 1
water 1
about 1
penetrating 1
those 1
vast 1
forests 1
and 1
civilizing 1
or 1
exterminating 1
the 1
dangerous 1
savages 1
that 1
is 1
we 1
men 1
talked 1
of 1
that 1
last 1
not 1
with 1
the 1
women 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
definite 1
aversion 1
to 1
killing 1
things 1
but 1
meanwhile 1
there 1
was 1
high 1
council 1
being 1
held 1
among 1
the 1
wisest 1
of 1
them 1
all 1
the 1
students 1
and 1
thinkers 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
gathering 1
facts 1
from 1
us 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
collating 1
and 1
relating 1
them 1
and 1
making 1
inferences 1
laid 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
their 1
labors 1
before 1
the 1
council 1
little 1
had 1
we 1
thought 1
that 1
our 1
careful 1
efforts 1
at 1
concealment 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
easily 1
seen 1
through 1
with 1
never 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
show 1
us 1
that 1
they 1
saw 1
they 1
had 1
followed 1
up 1
words 1
of 1
ours 1
on 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
optics 1
asked 1
innocent 1
questions 1
about 1
glasses 1
and 1
the 1
like 1
and 1
were 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
defective 1
eyesight 1
so 1
common 1
among 1
us 1
with 1
the 1
lightest 1
touch 1
different 1
women 1
asking 1
different 1
questions 1
at 1
different 1
times 1
and 1
putting 1
all 1
our 1
answers 1
together 1
like 1
a 1
picture 1
puzzle 1
they 1
had 1
figured 1
out 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
skeleton 1
chart 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
prevalence 1
of 1
disease 1
among 1
us 1
even 1
more 1
subtly 1
with 1
no 1
show 1
of 1
horror 1
or 1
condemnation 1
they 1
had 1
gathered 1
something 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
truth 1
but 1
something 1
pretty 1
clear 1
about 1
poverty 1
vice 1
and 1
crime 1
they 1
even 1
had 1
a 1
goodly 1
number 1
of 1
our 1
dangers 1
all 1
itemized 1
from 1
asking 1
us 1
about 1
insurance 1
and 1
innocent 1
things 1
like 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
well 1
posted 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
different 1
races 1
beginning 1
with 1
their 1
poison 1
arrow 1
natives 1
down 1
below 1
and 1
widening 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
broad 1
racial 1
divisions 1
we 1
had 1
told 1
them 1
about 1
never 1
a 1
shocked 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
face 1
or 1
exclamation 1
of 1
revolt 1
had 1
warned 1
us 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
extracting 1
the 1
evidence 1
without 1
our 1
knowing 1
it 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
and 1
now 1
were 1
studying 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
devout 1
earnestness 1
the 1
matter 1
they 1
had 1
prepared 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
rather 1
distressing 1
to 1
us 1
they 1
first 1
explained 1
the 1
matter 1
fully 1
to 1
ellador 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
who 1
purposed 1
visiting 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
celis 1
they 1
said 1
nothing 1
she 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
distressed 1
while 1
the 1
whole 1
nation 1
waited 1
on 1
her 1
great 1
work 1
finally 1
jeff 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
called 1
in 1
somel 1
and 1
zava 1
were 1
there 1
and 1
ellador 1
with 1
many 1
others 1
that 1
we 1
knew 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
great 1
globe 1
quite 1
fairly 1
mapped 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
small 1
section 1
maps 1
in 1
that 1
compendium 1
of 1
ours 1
they 1
had 1
the 1
different 1
peoples 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
roughly 1
outlined 1
and 1
their 1
status 1
in 1
civilization 1
indicated 1
they 1
had 1
charts 1
and 1
figures 1
and 1
estimates 1
based 1
on 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
that 1
traitorous 1
little 1
book 1
and 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
learned 1
from 1
us 1
somel 1
explained 1
we 1
find 1
that 1
in 1
all 1
your 1
historic 1
period 1
so 1
much 1
longer 1
than 1
ours 1
that 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
interplay 1
of 1
services 1
the 1
exchange 1
of 1
inventions 1
and 1
discoveries 1
and 1
the 1
wonderful 1
progress 1
we 1
so 1
admire 1
that 1
in 1
this 1
widespread 1
other 1
world 1
of 1
yours 1
there 1
is 1
still 1
much 1
disease 1
often 1
contagious 1
we 1
admitted 1
this 1
at 1
once 1
also 1
there 1
is 1
still 1
in 1
varying 1
degree 1
ignorance 1
with 1
prejudice 1
and 1
unbridled 1
emotion 1
this 1
too 1
was 1
admitted 1
we 1
find 1
also 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
advance 1
of 1
democracy 1
and 1
the 1
increase 1
of 1
wealth 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
still 1
unrest 1
and 1
sometimes 1
combat 1
yes 1
yes 1
we 1
admitted 1
it 1
all 1
we 1
were 1
used 1
to 1
these 1
things 1
and 1
saw 1
no 1
reason 1
for 1
so 1
much 1
seriousness 1
all 1
things 1
considered 1
they 1
said 1
and 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
hundredth 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
they 1
were 1
considering 1
we 1
are 1
unwilling 1
to 1
expose 1
our 1
country 1
to 1
free 1
communication 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
yet 1
if 1
ellador 1
comes 1
back 1
and 1
we 1
approve 1
her 1
report 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
done 1
later 1
but 1
not 1
yet 1
so 1
we 1
have 1
this 1
to 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
gentlemen 1
they 1
knew 1
that 1
word 1
was 1
held 1
a 1
title 1
of 1
honor 1
with 1
us 1
that 1
you 1
promise 1
not 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
to 1
betray 1
the 1
location 1
of 1
this 1
country 1
until 1
permission 1
after 1
ellador 1
s 1
return 1
jeff 1
was 1
perfectly 1
satisfied 1
he 1
thought 1
they 1
were 1
quite 1
right 1
he 1
always 1
did 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
an 1
alien 1
become 1
naturalized 1
more 1
quickly 1
than 1
that 1
man 1
in 1
herland 1
i 1
studied 1
it 1
awhile 1
thinking 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
they 1
d 1
have 1
if 1
some 1
of 1
our 1
contagions 1
got 1
loose 1
there 1
and 1
concluded 1
they 1
were 1
right 1
so 1
i 1
agreed 1
terry 1
was 1
the 1
obstacle 1
indeed 1
i 1
won 1
t 1
he 1
protested 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
i 1
ll 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
get 1
an 1
expedition 1
fixed 1
up 1
to 1
force 1
an 1
entrance 1
into 1
ma 1
land 1
then 1
they 1
said 1
quite 1
calmly 1
he 1
must 1
remain 1
an 1
absolute 1
prisoner 1
always 1
anesthesia 1
would 1
be 1
kinder 1
urged 1
moadine 1
and 1
safer 1
added 1
zava 1
he 1
will 1
promise 1
i 1
think 1
said 1
ellador 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
with 1
which 1
agreement 1
we 1
at 1

england 1
you 1
will 1
rejoice 1
to 1
hear 1
that 1
no 1
disaster 1
has 1
accompanied 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
an 1
enterprise 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
regarded 1
with 1
such 1
evil 1
forebodings 1
i 1
arrived 1
here 1
yesterday 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
task 1
is 1
to 1
assure 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
of 1
my 1
welfare 1
and 1
increasing 1
confidence 1
in 1
the 1
success 1
of 1
my 1
undertaking 1
i 1
am 1
already 1
far 1
north 1
of 1
london 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
petersburgh 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
cold 1
northern 1
breeze 1
play 1
upon 1
my 1
cheeks 1
which 1
braces 1
my 1
nerves 1
and 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
delight 1
do 1
you 1
understand 1
this 1
feeling 1
this 1
breeze 1
which 1
has 1
travelled 1
from 1
the 1
regions 1
towards 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
advancing 1
gives 1
me 1
a 1
foretaste 1
of 1
those 1
icy 1
climes 1
inspirited 1
by 1
this 1
wind 1
of 1
promise 1
my 1
daydreams 1
become 1
more 1
fervent 1
and 1
vivid 1
i 1
try 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
be 1
persuaded 1
that 1
the 1
pole 1
is 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
frost 1
and 1
desolation 1
it 1
ever 1
presents 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
imagination 1
as 1
the 1
region 1
of 1
beauty 1
and 1
delight 1
there 1
margaret 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
forever 1
visible 1
its 1
broad 1
disk 1
just 1
skirting 1
the 1
horizon 1
and 1
diffusing 1
a 1
perpetual 1
splendour 1
there 1
for 1
with 1
your 1
leave 1
my 1
sister 1
i 1
will 1
put 1
some 1
trust 1
in 1
preceding 1
navigators 1
there 1
snow 1
and 1
frost 1
are 1
banished 1
and 1
sailing 1
over 1
a 1
calm 1
sea 1
we 1
may 1
be 1
wafted 1
to 1
a 1
land 1
surpassing 1
in 1
wonders 1
and 1
in 1
beauty 1
every 1
region 1
hitherto 1
discovered 1
on 1
the 1
habitable 1
globe 1
its 1
productions 1
and 1
features 1
may 1
be 1
without 1
example 1
as 1
the 1
phenomena 1
of 1
the 1
heavenly 1
bodies 1
undoubtedly 1
are 1
in 1
those 1
undiscovered 1
solitudes 1
what 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
expected 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
of 1
eternal 1
light 1
i 1
may 1
there 1
discover 1
the 1
wondrous 1
power 1
which 1
attracts 1
the 1
needle 1
and 1
may 1
regulate 1
a 1
thousand 1
celestial 1
observations 1
that 1
require 1
only 1
this 1
voyage 1
to 1
render 1
their 1
seeming 1
eccentricities 1
consistent 1
forever 1
i 1
shall 1
satiate 1
my 1
ardent 1
curiosity 1
with 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
never 1
before 1
visited 1
and 1
may 1
tread 1
a 1
land 1
never 1
before 1
imprinted 1
by 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
man 1
these 1
are 1
my 1
enticements 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
sufficient 1
to 1
conquer 1
all 1
fear 1
of 1
danger 1
or 1
death 1
and 1
to 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
commence 1
this 1
laborious 1
voyage 1
with 1
the 1
joy 1
a 1
child 1
feels 1
when 1
he 1
embarks 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
boat 1
with 1
his 1
holiday 1
mates 1
on 1
an 1
expedition 1
of 1
discovery 1
up 1
his 1
native 1
river 1
but 1
supposing 1
all 1
these 1
conjectures 1
to 1
be 1
false 1
you 1
cannot 1
contest 1
the 1
inestimable 1
benefit 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
confer 1
on 1
all 1
mankind 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
generation 1
by 1
discovering 1
a 1
passage 1
near 1
the 1
pole 1
to 1
those 1
countries 1
to 1
reach 1
which 1
at 1
present 1
so 1
many 1
months 1
are 1
requisite 1
or 1
by 1
ascertaining 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
magnet 1
which 1
if 1
at 1
all 1
possible 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
effected 1
by 1
an 1
undertaking 1
such 1
as 1
mine 1
these 1
reflections 1
have 1
dispelled 1
the 1
agitation 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
began 1
my 1
letter 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
my 1
heart 1
glow 1
with 1
an 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
elevates 1
me 1
to 1
heaven 1
for 1
nothing 1
contributes 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
tranquillize 1
the 1
mind 1
as 1
a 1
steady 1
purpose 1
a 1
point 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
soul 1
may 1
fix 1
its 1
intellectual 1
eye 1
this 1
expedition 1
has 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
dream 1
of 1
my 1
early 1
years 1
i 1
have 1
read 1
with 1
ardour 1
the 1
accounts 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
voyages 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
in 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
arriving 1
at 1
the 1
north 1
pacific 1
ocean 1
through 1
the 1
seas 1
which 1
surround 1
the 1
pole 1
you 1
may 1
remember 1
that 1
a 1
history 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
voyages 1
made 1
for 1
purposes 1
of 1
discovery 1
composed 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
our 1
good 1
uncle 1
thomas 1
library 1
my 1
education 1
was 1
neglected 1
yet 1
i 1
was 1
passionately 1
fond 1
of 1
reading 1
these 1
volumes 1
were 1
my 1
study 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
and 1
my 1
familiarity 1
with 1
them 1
increased 1
that 1
regret 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
felt 1
as 1
a 1
child 1
on 1
learning 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
dying 1
injunction 1
had 1
forbidden 1
my 1
uncle 1
to 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
embark 1
in 1
a 1
seafaring 1
life 1
these 1
visions 1
faded 1
when 1
i 1
perused 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
those 1
poets 1
whose 1
effusions 1
entranced 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
lifted 1
it 1
to 1
heaven 1
i 1
also 1
became 1
a 1
poet 1
and 1
for 1
one 1
year 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
paradise 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
creation 1
i 1
imagined 1
that 1
i 1
also 1
might 1
obtain 1
a 1
niche 1
in 1
the 1
temple 1
where 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
homer 1
and 1
shakespeare 1
are 1
consecrated 1
you 1
are 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
my 1
failure 1
and 1
how 1
heavily 1
i 1
bore 1
the 1
disappointment 1
but 1
just 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
inherited 1
the 1
fortune 1
of 1
my 1
cousin 1
and 1
my 1
thoughts 1
were 1
turned 1
into 1
the 1
channel 1
of 1
their 1
earlier 1
bent 1
six 1
years 1
have 1
passed 1
since 1
i 1
resolved 1
on 1
my 1
present 1
undertaking 1
i 1
can 1
even 1
now 1
remember 1
the 1
hour 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
dedicated 1
myself 1
to 1
this 1
great 1
enterprise 1
i 1
commenced 1
by 1
inuring 1
my 1
body 1
to 1
hardship 1
i 1
accompanied 1
the 1
whale 1
fishers 1
on 1
several 1
expeditions 1
to 1
the 1
north 1
sea 1
i 1
voluntarily 1
endured 1
cold 1
famine 1
thirst 1
and 1
want 1
of 1
sleep 1
i 1
often 1
worked 1
harder 1
than 1
the 1
common 1
sailors 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
devoted 1
my 1
nights 1
to 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
mathematics 1
the 1
theory 1
of 1
medicine 1
and 1
those 1
branches 1
of 1
physical 1
science 1
from 1
which 1
a 1
naval 1
adventurer 1
might 1
derive 1
the 1
greatest 1
practical 1
advantage 1
twice 1
i 1
actually 1
hired 1
myself 1
as 1
an 1
under 1
mate 1
in 1
a 1
greenland 1
whaler 1
and 1
acquitted 1
myself 1
to 1
admiration 1
i 1
must 1
own 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
proud 1
when 1
my 1
captain 1
offered 1
me 1
the 1
second 1
dignity 1
in 1
the 1
vessel 1
and 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
remain 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
earnestness 1
so 1
valuable 1
did 1
he 1
consider 1
my 1
services 1
and 1
now 1
dear 1
margaret 1
do 1
i 1
not 1
deserve 1
to 1
accomplish 1
some 1
great 1
purpose 1
my 1
life 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
passed 1
in 1
ease 1
and 1
luxury 1
but 1
i 1
preferred 1
glory 1
to 1
every 1
enticement 1
that 1
wealth 1
placed 1
in 1
my 1
path 1
oh 1
that 1
some 1
encouraging 1
voice 1
would 1
answer 1
in 1
the 1
affirmative 1
my 1
courage 1
and 1
my 1
resolution 1
is 1
firm 1
but 1
my 1
hopes 1
fluctuate 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
are 1
often 1
depressed 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
proceed 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
difficult 1
voyage 1
the 1
emergencies 1
of 1
which 1
will 1
demand 1
all 1
my 1
fortitude 1
i 1
am 1
required 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
others 1
but 1
sometimes 1
to 1
sustain 1
my 1
own 1
when 1
theirs 1
are 1
failing 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
favourable 1
period 1
for 1
travelling 1
in 1
russia 1
they 1
fly 1
quickly 1
over 1
the 1
snow 1
in 1
their 1
sledges 1
the 1
motion 1
is 1
pleasant 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
far 1
more 1
agreeable 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
an 1
english 1
stagecoach 1
the 1
cold 1
is 1
not 1
excessive 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
wrapped 1
in 1
furs 1
a 1
dress 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
adopted 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
difference 1
between 1
walking 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
remaining 1
seated 1
motionless 1
for 1
hours 1
when 1
no 1
exercise 1
prevents 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
actually 1
freezing 1
in 1
your 1
veins 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
ambition 1
to 1
lose 1
my 1
life 1
on 1
the 1
post 1
road 1
between 1
st 1
petersburgh 1
and 1
archangel 1
i 1
shall 1
depart 1
for 1
the 1
latter 1
town 1
in 1
a 1
fortnight 1
or 1
three 1
weeks 1
and 1
my 1
intention 1
is 1
to 1
hire 1
a 1
ship 1
there 1
which 1
can 1
easily 1
be 1
done 1
by 1
paying 1
the 1
insurance 1
for 1
the 1
owner 1
and 1
to 1
engage 1
as 1
many 1
sailors 1
as 1
i 1
think 1
necessary 1
among 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
the 1
whale 1
fishing 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
sail 1
until 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
june 1
and 1
when 1
shall 1
i 1
return 1
ah 1
dear 1
sister 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
answer 1
this 1
question 1
if 1
i 1
succeed 1
many 1
many 1
months 1
perhaps 1
years 1
will 1
pass 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
meet 1
if 1
i 1
fail 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
me 1

never 1

i 1
may 1
again 1

again 1
testify 1
my 1

28th 1

to 1
mrs 1
saville 1
england 1
how 1
slowly 1
the 1
time 1
passes 1
here 1
encompassed 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
by 1
frost 1
and 1
snow 1
yet 1
a 1
second 1
step 1
is 1
taken 1
towards 1
my 1
enterprise 1
i 1
have 1
hired 1
a 1
vessel 1
and 1
am 1
occupied 1
in 1
collecting 1
my 1
sailors 1
those 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
engaged 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
men 1
on 1
whom 1
i 1
can 1
depend 1
and 1
are 1
certainly 1
possessed 1
of 1
dauntless 1
courage 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
one 1
want 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
yet 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
satisfy 1
and 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
now 1
feel 1
as 1
a 1
most 1
severe 1
evil 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
friend 1
margaret 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
glowing 1
with 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
success 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
none 1
to 1
participate 1
my 1
joy 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
assailed 1
by 1
disappointment 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
sustain 1
me 1
in 1
dejection 1
i 1
shall 1
commit 1
my 1
thoughts 1
to 1
paper 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
poor 1
medium 1
for 1
the 1
communication 1
of 1
feeling 1
i 1
desire 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
could 1
sympathize 1
with 1
me 1
whose 1
eyes 1
would 1
reply 1
to 1
mine 1
you 1
may 1
deem 1
me 1
romantic 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
but 1
i 1
bitterly 1
feel 1
the 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
friend 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
one 1
near 1
me 1
gentle 1
yet 1
courageous 1
possessed 1
of 1
a 1
cultivated 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
capacious 1
mind 1
whose 1
tastes 1
are 1
like 1
my 1
own 1
to 1
approve 1
or 1
amend 1
my 1
plans 1
how 1
would 1
such 1
a 1
friend 1
repair 1
the 1
faults 1
of 1
your 1
poor 1
brother 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
ardent 1
in 1
execution 1
and 1
too 1
impatient 1
of 1
difficulties 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
still 1
greater 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
self 1
educated 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
fourteen 1
years 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
ran 1
wild 1
on 1
a 1
common 1
and 1
read 1
nothing 1
but 1
our 1
uncle 1
thomas 1
books 1
of 1
voyages 1
at 1
that 1
age 1
i 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
celebrated 1
poets 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
country 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
derive 1
its 1
most 1
important 1
benefits 1
from 1
such 1
a 1
conviction 1
that 1
i 1
perceived 1
the 1
necessity 1
of 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
with 1
more 1
languages 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
twenty 1
eight 1
and 1
am 1
in 1
reality 1
more 1
illiterate 1
than 1
many 1
schoolboys 1
of 1
fifteen 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
thought 1
more 1
and 1
that 1
my 1
daydreams 1
are 1
more 1
extended 1
and 1
magnificent 1
but 1
they 1
want 1
as 1
the 1
painters 1
call 1
it 1
keeping 1
and 1
i 1
greatly 1
need 1
a 1
friend 1
who 1
would 1
have 1
sense 1
enough 1
not 1
to 1
despise 1
me 1
as 1
romantic 1
and 1
affection 1
enough 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
endeavour 1
to 1
regulate 1
my 1
mind 1
well 1
these 1
are 1
useless 1
complaints 1
i 1
shall 1
certainly 1
find 1
no 1
friend 1
on 1
the 1
wide 1
ocean 1
nor 1
even 1
here 1
in 1
archangel 1
among 1
merchants 1
and 1
seamen 1
yet 1
some 1
feelings 1
unallied 1
to 1
the 1
dross 1
of 1
human 1
nature 1
beat 1
even 1
in 1
these 1
rugged 1
bosoms 1
my 1
lieutenant 1
for 1
instance 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
wonderful 1
courage 1
and 1
enterprise 1
he 1
is 1
madly 1
desirous 1
of 1
glory 1
or 1
rather 1
to 1
word 1
my 1
phrase 1
more 1
characteristically 1
of 1
advancement 1
in 1
his 1
profession 1
he 1
is 1
an 1
englishman 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
national 1
and 1
professional 1
prejudices 1
unsoftened 1
by 1
cultivation 1
retains 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
noblest 1
endowments 1
of 1
humanity 1
i 1
first 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
him 1
on 1
board 1
a 1
whale 1
vessel 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
unemployed 1
in 1
this 1
city 1
i 1
easily 1
engaged 1
him 1
to 1
assist 1
in 1
my 1
enterprise 1
the 1
master 1
is 1
a 1
person 1
of 1
an 1
excellent 1
disposition 1
and 1
is 1
remarkable 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
for 1
his 1
gentleness 1
and 1
the 1
mildness 1
of 1
his 1
discipline 1
this 1
circumstance 1
added 1
to 1
his 1
well 1
known 1
integrity 1
and 1
dauntless 1
courage 1
made 1
me 1
very 1
desirous 1
to 1
engage 1
him 1
a 1
youth 1
passed 1
in 1
solitude 1
my 1
best 1
years 1
spent 1
under 1
your 1
gentle 1
and 1
feminine 1
fosterage 1
has 1
so 1
refined 1
the 1
groundwork 1
of 1
my 1
character 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
overcome 1
an 1
intense 1
distaste 1
to 1
the 1
usual 1
brutality 1
exercised 1
on 1
board 1
ship 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
believed 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
necessary 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
a 1
mariner 1
equally 1
noted 1
for 1
his 1
kindliness 1
of 1
heart 1
and 1
the 1
respect 1
and 1
obedience 1
paid 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
his 1
crew 1
i 1
felt 1
myself 1
peculiarly 1
fortunate 1
in 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
secure 1
his 1
services 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
first 1
in 1
rather 1
a 1
romantic 1
manner 1
from 1
a 1
lady 1
who 1
owes 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
happiness 1
of 1
her 1
life 1
this 1
briefly 1
is 1
his 1
story 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
he 1
loved 1
a 1
young 1
russian 1
lady 1
of 1
moderate 1
fortune 1
and 1
having 1
amassed 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
in 1
prize 1
money 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
consented 1
to 1
the 1
match 1
he 1
saw 1
his 1
mistress 1
once 1
before 1
the 1
destined 1
ceremony 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
bathed 1
in 1
tears 1
and 1
throwing 1
herself 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
entreated 1
him 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
confessing 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
that 1
she 1
loved 1
another 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
poor 1
and 1
that 1
her 1
father 1
would 1
never 1
consent 1
to 1
the 1
union 1
my 1
generous 1
friend 1
reassured 1
the 1
suppliant 1
and 1
on 1
being 1
informed 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
instantly 1
abandoned 1
his 1
pursuit 1
he 1
had 1
already 1
bought 1
a 1
farm 1
with 1
his 1
money 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
designed 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
he 1
bestowed 1
the 1
whole 1
on 1
his 1
rival 1
together 1
with 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
his 1
prize 1
money 1
to 1
purchase 1
stock 1
and 1
then 1
himself 1
solicited 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
s 1
father 1
to 1
consent 1
to 1
her 1
marriage 1
with 1
her 1
lover 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
decidedly 1
refused 1
thinking 1
himself 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
who 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
father 1
inexorable 1
quitted 1
his 1
country 1
nor 1
returned 1
until 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
his 1
former 1
mistress 1
was 1
married 1
according 1
to 1
her 1
inclinations 1
what 1
a 1
noble 1
fellow 1
you 1
will 1
exclaim 1
he 1
is 1
so 1
but 1
then 1
he 1
is 1
wholly 1
uneducated 1
he 1
is 1
as 1
silent 1
as 1
a 1
turk 1
and 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
ignorant 1
carelessness 1
attends 1
him 1
which 1
while 1
it 1
renders 1
his 1
conduct 1
the 1
more 1
astonishing 1
detracts 1
from 1
the 1
interest 1
and 1
sympathy 1
which 1
otherwise 1
he 1
would 1
command 1
yet 1
do 1
not 1
suppose 1
because 1
i 1
complain 1
a 1
little 1
or 1
because 1
i 1
can 1
conceive 1
a 1
consolation 1
for 1
my 1
toils 1
which 1
i 1
may 1
never 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
wavering 1
in 1
my 1
resolutions 1
those 1
are 1
as 1
fixed 1
as 1
fate 1
and 1
my 1
voyage 1
is 1
only 1
now 1
delayed 1
until 1
the 1
weather 1
shall 1
permit 1
my 1
embarkation 1
the 1
winter 1
has 1
been 1
dreadfully 1
severe 1
but 1
the 1
spring 1
promises 1
well 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
considered 1
as 1
a 1
remarkably 1
early 1
season 1
so 1
that 1
perhaps 1
i 1
may 1
sail 1
sooner 1
than 1
i 1
expected 1
i 1
shall 1
do 1
nothing 1
rashly 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
confide 1
in 1
my 1
prudence 1
and 1
considerateness 1
whenever 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
others 1
is 1
committed 1
to 1
my 1
care 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
sensations 1
on 1
the 1
near 1
prospect 1
of 1
my 1
undertaking 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
communicate 1
to 1
you 1
a 1
conception 1
of 1
the 1
trembling 1
sensation 1
half 1
pleasurable 1
and 1
half 1
fearful 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
preparing 1
to 1
depart 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
to 1
unexplored 1
regions 1
to 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
mist 1
and 1
snow 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1

no 1
albatross 1
therefore 1
do 1
not 1
be 1
alarmed 1
for 1
my 1
safety 1
or 1
if 1
i 1
should 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you 1
as 1
worn 1
and 1
woeful 1
as 1
the 1
ancient 1
mariner 1
you 1
will 1
smile 1
at 1
my 1
allusion 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
disclose 1
a 1
secret 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
attributed 1
my 1
attachment 1
to 1
my 1
passionate 1
enthusiasm 1
for 1
the 1
dangerous 1
mysteries 1
of 1
ocean 1
to 1
that 1
production 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
imaginative 1
of 1
modern 1
poets 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
at 1
work 1
in 1
my 1
soul 1
which 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
understand 1
i 1
am 1
practically 1
industrious 1
painstaking 1
a 1
workman 1
to 1
execute 1
with 1
perseverance 1
and 1
labour 1
but 1
besides 1
this 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
marvellous 1
a 1
belief 1
in 1
the 1
marvellous 1
intertwined 1
in 1
all 1
my 1
projects 1
which 1
hurries 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
common 1
pathways 1
of 1
men 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
wild 1
sea 1
and 1
unvisited 1
regions 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
explore 1
but 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
dearer 1
considerations 1
shall 1
i 1
meet 1
you 1
again 1
after 1
having 1
traversed 1
immense 1
seas 1

returned 1
by 1
the 1

southern 1
cape 1
of 1

america 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
expect 1
such 1
success 1

well 1
advanced 1
on 1

for 1
many 1
years 1
i 1

however 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
my 1
men 1
are 1
bold 1
and 1
apparently 1
firm 1
of 1
purpose 1
nor 1
do 1
the 1
floating 1
sheets 1
of 1
ice 1
that 1
continually 1
pass 1
us 1
indicating 1
the 1
dangers 1
of 1
the 1
region 1
towards 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
advancing 1
appear 1
to 1
dismay 1
them 1
we 1
have 1
already 1
reached 1
a 1
very 1
high 1
latitude 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
height 1
of 1
summer 1
and 1
although 1
not 1
so 1
warm 1
as 1
in 1
england 1
the 1
southern 1
gales 1
which 1
blow 1
us 1
speedily 1
towards 1
those 1
shores 1
which 1
i 1
so 1
ardently 1
desire 1
to 1
attain 1
breathe 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
renovating 1
warmth 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
expected 1
no 1
incidents 1
have 1
hitherto 1
befallen 1
us 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
figure 1
in 1
a 1
letter 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
stiff 1
gales 1
and 1
the 1
springing 1
of 1
a 1
leak 1
are 1
accidents 1
which 1
experienced 1
navigators 1
scarcely 1
remember 1
to 1
record 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
well 1

nothing 1
worse 1

that 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
sake 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
yours 1
i 1

not 1
rashly 1
encounter 1
danger 1

be 1
cool 1

the 1
pathless 1

the 1
very 1
stars 1
themselves 1

witnesses 1
and 1
testimonies 1

my 1
triumph 1
why 1
not 1
still 1
proceed 1
over 1
the 1
untamed 1

obedient 1

determined 1

to 1
mrs 1
saville 1
england 1
so 1
strange 1
an 1
accident 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
forbear 1
recording 1
it 1
although 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
probable 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
me 1
before 1
these 1
papers 1
can 1
come 1
into 1
your 1
possession 1
last 1
monday 1
july 1
31st 1
we 1
were 1
nearly 1
surrounded 1
by 1
ice 1
which 1
closed 1
in 1
the 1
ship 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
scarcely 1
leaving 1
her 1
the 1
sea 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
floated 1
our 1
situation 1
was 1
somewhat 1
dangerous 1
especially 1
as 1
we 1
were 1
compassed 1
round 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
thick 1
fog 1
we 1
accordingly 1
lay 1
to 1
hoping 1
that 1
some 1
change 1
would 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
and 1
weather 1
about 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
mist 1
cleared 1
away 1
and 1
we 1
beheld 1
stretched 1
out 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
vast 1
and 1
irregular 1
plains 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
no 1
end 1
some 1
of 1
my 1
comrades 1
groaned 1
and 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
watchful 1
with 1
anxious 1
thoughts 1
when 1
a 1
strange 1
sight 1
suddenly 1
attracted 1
our 1
attention 1
and 1
diverted 1
our 1
solicitude 1
from 1
our 1
own 1
situation 1
we 1
perceived 1
a 1
low 1
carriage 1
fixed 1
on 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
drawn 1
by 1
dogs 1
pass 1
on 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
a 1
being 1
which 1
had 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
but 1
apparently 1
of 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
sledge 1
and 1
guided 1
the 1
dogs 1
we 1
watched 1
the 1
rapid 1
progress 1
of 1
the 1
traveller 1
with 1
our 1
telescopes 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
lost 1
among 1
the 1
distant 1
inequalities 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
this 1
appearance 1
excited 1
our 1
unqualified 1
wonder 1
we 1
were 1
as 1
we 1
believed 1
many 1
hundred 1
miles 1
from 1
any 1
land 1
but 1
this 1
apparition 1
seemed 1
to 1
denote 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
reality 1
so 1
distant 1
as 1
we 1
had 1
supposed 1
shut 1
in 1
however 1
by 1
ice 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
track 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
observed 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
attention 1
about 1
two 1
hours 1
after 1
this 1
occurrence 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
ground 1
sea 1
and 1
before 1
night 1
the 1
ice 1
broke 1
and 1
freed 1
our 1
ship 1
we 1
however 1
lay 1
to 1
until 1
the 1
morning 1
fearing 1
to 1
encounter 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
those 1
large 1
loose 1
masses 1
which 1
float 1
about 1
after 1
the 1
breaking 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
i 1
profited 1
of 1
this 1
time 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
however 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
light 1
i 1
went 1
upon 1
deck 1
and 1
found 1
all 1
the 1
sailors 1
busy 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
vessel 1
apparently 1
talking 1
to 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
fact 1
a 1
sledge 1
like 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
before 1
which 1
had 1
drifted 1
towards 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
a 1
large 1
fragment 1
of 1
ice 1
only 1
one 1
dog 1
remained 1
alive 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
within 1
it 1
whom 1
the 1
sailors 1
were 1
persuading 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
vessel 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
as 1
the 1
other 1
traveller 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
savage 1
inhabitant 1
of 1
some 1
undiscovered 1
island 1
but 1
a 1
european 1
when 1
i 1
appeared 1
on 1
deck 1
the 1
master 1
said 1
here 1
is 1
our 1
captain 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
not 1
allow 1
you 1
to 1
perish 1
on 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
on 1
perceiving 1
me 1
the 1
stranger 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
english 1
although 1
with 1
a 1
foreign 1
accent 1
before 1
i 1
come 1
on 1
board 1
your 1
vessel 1
said 1
he 1
will 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
kindness 1
to 1
inform 1
me 1
whither 1
you 1
are 1
bound 1
you 1
may 1
conceive 1
my 1
astonishment 1
on 1
hearing 1
such 1
a 1
question 1
addressed 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
destruction 1
and 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
supposed 1
that 1
my 1
vessel 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
resource 1
which 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
exchanged 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
precious 1
wealth 1
the 1
earth 1
can 1
afford 1
i 1
replied 1
however 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
on 1
a 1
voyage 1
of 1
discovery 1
towards 1
the 1
northern 1
pole 1
upon 1
hearing 1
this 1
he 1
appeared 1
satisfied 1
and 1
consented 1
to 1
come 1
on 1
board 1
good 1
god 1
margaret 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
thus 1
capitulated 1
for 1
his 1
safety 1
your 1
surprise 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
boundless 1
his 1
limbs 1
were 1
nearly 1
frozen 1
and 1
his 1
body 1
dreadfully 1
emaciated 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
suffering 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
so 1
wretched 1
a 1
condition 1
we 1
attempted 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
but 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
quitted 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
he 1
fainted 1
we 1
accordingly 1
brought 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
restored 1
him 1
to 1
animation 1
by 1
rubbing 1
him 1
with 1
brandy 1
and 1
forcing 1
him 1
to 1
swallow 1
a 1
small 1
quantity 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
showed 1
signs 1
of 1
life 1
we 1
wrapped 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
blankets 1
and 1
placed 1
him 1
near 1
the 1
chimney 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
stove 1
by 1
slow 1
degrees 1
he 1
recovered 1
and 1
ate 1
a 1
little 1
soup 1
which 1
restored 1
him 1
wonderfully 1
two 1
days 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
feared 1
that 1
his 1
sufferings 1
had 1
deprived 1
him 1
of 1
understanding 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
some 1
measure 1
recovered 1
i 1
removed 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
cabin 1
and 1
attended 1
on 1
him 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
my 1
duty 1
would 1
permit 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
more 1
interesting 1
creature 1
his 1
eyes 1
have 1
generally 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
wildness 1
and 1
even 1
madness 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
moments 1
when 1
if 1
anyone 1
performs 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
kindness 1
towards 1
him 1
or 1
does 1
him 1
any 1
the 1
most 1
trifling 1
service 1
his 1
whole 1
countenance 1
is 1
lighted 1
up 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
with 1
a 1
beam 1
of 1
benevolence 1
and 1
sweetness 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
equalled 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
generally 1
melancholy 1
and 1
despairing 1
and 1
sometimes 1
he 1
gnashes 1
his 1
teeth 1
as 1
if 1
impatient 1
of 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
woes 1
that 1
oppresses 1
him 1
when 1
my 1
guest 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
recovered 1
i 1
had 1
great 1
trouble 1
to 1
keep 1
off 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
wished 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
a 1
thousand 1
questions 1
but 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
allow 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
tormented 1
by 1
their 1
idle 1
curiosity 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
body 1
and 1
mind 1
whose 1
restoration 1
evidently 1
depended 1
upon 1
entire 1
repose 1
once 1
however 1
the 1
lieutenant 1
asked 1
why 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
so 1
far 1
upon 1
the 1
ice 1
in 1
so 1
strange 1
a 1
vehicle 1
his 1
countenance 1
instantly 1
assumed 1
an 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
deepest 1
gloom 1
and 1
he 1
replied 1
to 1
seek 1
one 1
who 1
fled 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
did 1
the 1
man 1
whom 1
you 1
pursued 1
travel 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
fashion 1
yes 1
then 1
i 1
fancy 1
we 1
have 1
seen 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
we 1
picked 1
you 1
up 1
we 1
saw 1
some 1
dogs 1
drawing 1
a 1
sledge 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
across 1
the 1
ice 1
this 1
aroused 1
the 1
stranger 1
s 1
attention 1
and 1
he 1
asked 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
questions 1
concerning 1
the 1
route 1
which 1
the 1
demon 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
him 1
had 1
pursued 1
soon 1
after 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
alone 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
doubtless 1
excited 1
your 1
curiosity 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
these 1
good 1
people 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
too 1
considerate 1
to 1
make 1
inquiries 1
certainly 1
it 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
very 1
impertinent 1
and 1
inhuman 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
trouble 1
you 1
with 1
any 1
inquisitiveness 1
of 1
mine 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
rescued 1
me 1
from 1
a 1
strange 1
and 1
perilous 1
situation 1
you 1
have 1
benevolently 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
soon 1
after 1
this 1
he 1
inquired 1
if 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
breaking 1
up 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
had 1
destroyed 1
the 1
other 1
sledge 1
i 1
replied 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
answer 1
with 1
any 1
degree 1
of 1
certainty 1
for 1
the 1
ice 1
had 1
not 1
broken 1
until 1
near 1
midnight 1
and 1
the 1
traveller 1
might 1
have 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
safety 1
before 1
that 1
time 1
but 1
of 1
this 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
judge 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
a 1
new 1
spirit 1
of 1
life 1
animated 1
the 1
decaying 1
frame 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
he 1
manifested 1
the 1
greatest 1
eagerness 1
to 1
be 1
upon 1
deck 1
to 1
watch 1
for 1
the 1
sledge 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
appeared 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
persuaded 1
him 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
far 1
too 1
weak 1
to 1
sustain 1
the 1
rawness 1
of 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
i 1
have 1
promised 1
that 1
someone 1
should 1
watch 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
instant 1
notice 1
if 1
any 1
new 1
object 1
should 1
appear 1
in 1
sight 1
such 1
is 1
my 1
journal 1
of 1
what 1
relates 1
to 1
this 1
strange 1
occurrence 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
present 1
day 1
the 1
stranger 1
has 1
gradually 1
improved 1
in 1
health 1
but 1
is 1
very 1
silent 1
and 1
appears 1
uneasy 1
when 1
anyone 1
except 1
myself 1
enters 1
his 1
cabin 1
yet 1
his 1
manners 1
are 1
so 1
conciliating 1
and 1
gentle 1
that 1
the 1
sailors 1
are 1
all 1
interested 1
in 1
him 1
although 1
they 1
have 1
had 1
very 1
little 1
communication 1
with 1
him 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
i 1
begin 1
to 1
love 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
brother 1
and 1
his 1
constant 1
and 1
deep 1
grief 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
sympathy 1
and 1
compassion 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
noble 1
creature 1
in 1
his 1
better 1
days 1
being 1
even 1
now 1
in 1
wreck 1
so 1
attractive 1
and 1
amiable 1
i 1
said 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
letters 1
my 1
dear 1
margaret 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
find 1
no 1
friend 1
on 1
the 1
wide 1
ocean 1
yet 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
before 1
his 1
spirit 1
had 1
been 1
broken 1
by 1
misery 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
happy 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
as 1
the 1
brother 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
shall 1
continue 1
my 1
journal 1
concerning 1
the 1
stranger 1
at 1
intervals 1
should 1
i 1
have 1
any 1
fresh 1
incidents 1
to 1
record 1
august 1
13th 1
17 1
my 1
affection 1
for 1
my 1
guest 1
increases 1
every 1
day 1
he 1
excites 1
at 1
once 1
my 1
admiration 1
and 1
my 1
pity 1
to 1
an 1
astonishing 1
degree 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
see 1
so 1
noble 1
a 1
creature 1
destroyed 1
by 1
misery 1
without 1
feeling 1
the 1
most 1
poignant 1
grief 1
he 1
is 1
so 1
gentle 1
yet 1
so 1
wise 1
his 1
mind 1
is 1
so 1
cultivated 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
speaks 1
although 1
his 1
words 1
are 1
culled 1
with 1
the 1
choicest 1
art 1
yet 1
they 1
flow 1
with 1
rapidity 1
and 1
unparalleled 1
eloquence 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
much 1
recovered 1
from 1
his 1
illness 1
and 1
is 1
continually 1
on 1
the 1
deck 1
apparently 1
watching 1
for 1
the 1
sledge 1
that 1
preceded 1
his 1
own 1
yet 1
although 1
unhappy 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
utterly 1
occupied 1
by 1
his 1
own 1
misery 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
interests 1
himself 1
deeply 1
in 1
the 1
projects 1
of 1
others 1
he 1
has 1
frequently 1
conversed 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
mine 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
communicated 1
to 1
him 1
without 1
disguise 1
he 1
entered 1
attentively 1
into 1
all 1
my 1
arguments 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
my 1
eventual 1
success 1
and 1
into 1
every 1
minute 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
measures 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
to 1
secure 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
easily 1
led 1
by 1
the 1
sympathy 1
which 1
he 1
evinced 1
to 1
use 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
give 1
utterance 1
to 1
the 1
burning 1
ardour 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
to 1
say 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
fervour 1
that 1
warmed 1
me 1
how 1
gladly 1
i 1
would 1
sacrifice 1
my 1
fortune 1
my 1
existence 1
my 1
every 1
hope 1
to 1
the 1
furtherance 1
of 1
my 1
enterprise 1
one 1
man 1
s 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
were 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
price 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
the 1
acquirement 1
of 1
the 1
knowledge 1
which 1
i 1
sought 1
for 1
the 1
dominion 1
i 1
should 1
acquire 1
and 1
transmit 1
over 1
the 1
elemental 1
foes 1
of 1
our 1
race 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
a 1
dark 1
gloom 1
spread 1
over 1
my 1
listener 1
s 1
countenance 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
suppress 1
his 1
emotion 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
hands 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
my 1
voice 1
quivered 1
and 1
failed 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
beheld 1
tears 1
trickle 1
fast 1
from 1
between 1
his 1
fingers 1
a 1
groan 1
burst 1
from 1
his 1
heaving 1
breast 1
i 1
paused 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
spoke 1
in 1
broken 1
accents 1
unhappy 1
man 1
do 1
you 1
share 1
my 1
madness 1
have 1
you 1
drunk 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
intoxicating 1
draught 1
hear 1
me 1
let 1
me 1
reveal 1
my 1
tale 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
dash 1
the 1
cup 1
from 1
your 1
lips 1
such 1
words 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
strongly 1
excited 1
my 1
curiosity 1
but 1
the 1
paroxysm 1
of 1
grief 1
that 1
had 1
seized 1
the 1
stranger 1
overcame 1
his 1
weakened 1
powers 1
and 1
many 1
hours 1
of 1
repose 1
and 1
tranquil 1
conversation 1
were 1
necessary 1
to 1
restore 1
his 1
composure 1
having 1
conquered 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
his 1
feelings 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
despise 1
himself 1
for 1
being 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
quelling 1
the 1
dark 1
tyranny 1
of 1
despair 1
he 1
led 1
me 1
again 1
to 1
converse 1
concerning 1
myself 1
personally 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
earlier 1
years 1
the 1
tale 1
was 1
quickly 1
told 1
but 1
it 1
awakened 1
various 1
trains 1
of 1
reflection 1
i 1
spoke 1
of 1
my 1
desire 1
of 1
finding 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
my 1
thirst 1
for 1
a 1
more 1
intimate 1
sympathy 1
with 1
a 1
fellow 1
mind 1
than 1
had 1
ever 1
fallen 1
to 1
my 1
lot 1
and 1
expressed 1
my 1
conviction 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
could 1
boast 1
of 1
little 1
happiness 1
who 1
did 1
not 1
enjoy 1
this 1
blessing 1
i 1
agree 1
with 1
you 1
replied 1
the 1
stranger 1
we 1
are 1
unfashioned 1
creatures 1
but 1
half 1
made 1
up 1
if 1
one 1
wiser 1
better 1
dearer 1
than 1
ourselves 1
such 1
a 1
friend 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
do 1
not 1
lend 1
his 1
aid 1
to 1
perfectionate 1
our 1
weak 1
and 1
faulty 1
natures 1
i 1
once 1
had 1
a 1
friend 1
the 1
most 1
noble 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
and 1
am 1
entitled 1
therefore 1
to 1
judge 1
respecting 1
friendship 1
you 1
have 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
world 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
have 1
no 1
cause 1
for 1
despair 1
but 1
i 1
i 1
have 1
lost 1
everything 1
and 1
cannot 1
begin 1
life 1
anew 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
his 1
countenance 1
became 1
expressive 1
of 1
a 1
calm 1
settled 1
grief 1
that 1
touched 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
presently 1
retired 1
to 1
his 1
cabin 1
even 1
broken 1
in 1
spirit 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
feel 1
more 1
deeply 1
than 1
he 1
does 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
nature 1
the 1
starry 1
sky 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
every 1
sight 1
afforded 1
by 1
these 1
wonderful 1
regions 1
seem 1
still 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
elevating 1
his 1
soul 1
from 1
earth 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
has 1
a 1
double 1
existence 1
he 1
may 1
suffer 1
misery 1
and 1
be 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
disappointments 1
yet 1
when 1
he 1
has 1
retired 1
into 1
himself 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
like 1
a 1
celestial 1
spirit 1
that 1
has 1
a 1
halo 1
around 1
him 1
within 1
whose 1
circle 1
no 1
grief 1
or 1
folly 1
ventures 1
will 1
you 1
smile 1
at 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
i 1
express 1
concerning 1
this 1
divine 1
wanderer 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
if 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
tutored 1
and 1
refined 1
by 1
books 1
and 1
retirement 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
therefore 1
somewhat 1
fastidious 1
but 1
this 1
only 1
renders 1
you 1
the 1
more 1
fit 1
to 1
appreciate 1
the 1
extraordinary 1
merits 1
of 1
this 1
wonderful 1
man 1
sometimes 1
i 1
have 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
quality 1
it 1
is 1
which 1
he 1
possesses 1
that 1
elevates 1
him 1
so 1
immeasurably 1
above 1
any 1
other 1
person 1
i 1
ever 1
knew 1
i 1
believe 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
intuitive 1
discernment 1
a 1
quick 1
but 1
never 1
failing 1
power 1
of 1
judgment 1
a 1
penetration 1
into 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
things 1
unequalled 1
for 1
clearness 1

yesterday 1
the 1
stranger 1
said 1
to 1
me 1
you 1
may 1
easily 1
perceive 1
captain 1
walton 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
suffered 1
great 1
and 1
unparalleled 1
misfortunes 1
i 1
had 1
determined 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
these 1
evils 1
should 1
die 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
won 1
me 1
to 1
alter 1
my 1
determination 1
you 1
seek 1
for 1
knowledge 1
and 1
wisdom 1
as 1
i 1
once 1
did 1
and 1
i 1
ardently 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
gratification 1
of 1
your 1
wishes 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
a 1
serpent 1
to 1
sting 1
you 1
as 1
mine 1
has 1
been 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
relation 1
of 1
my 1
disasters 1
will 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
you 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
reflect 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
pursuing 1
the 1
same 1
course 1
exposing 1
yourself 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
dangers 1
which 1
have 1
rendered 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
i 1
imagine 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
deduce 1
an 1
apt 1
moral 1
from 1
my 1
tale 1
one 1
that 1
may 1
direct 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
succeed 1
in 1
your 1
undertaking 1
and 1
console 1
you 1
in 1
case 1
of 1
failure 1
prepare 1
to 1
hear 1
of 1
occurrences 1
which 1
are 1
usually 1
deemed 1
marvellous 1
were 1
we 1
among 1
the 1
tamer 1
scenes 1
of 1
nature 1
i 1
might 1
fear 1
to 1
encounter 1
your 1
unbelief 1
perhaps 1
your 1
ridicule 1
but 1
many 1
things 1
will 1
appear 1
possible 1
in 1
these 1
wild 1
and 1
mysterious 1
regions 1
which 1
would 1
provoke 1
the 1
laughter 1
of 1
those 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
ever 1
varied 1
powers 1
of 1
nature 1
nor 1
can 1
i 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
my 1
tale 1
conveys 1
in 1
its 1
series 1
internal 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
composed 1
you 1
may 1
easily 1
imagine 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
much 1
gratified 1
by 1
the 1
offered 1
communication 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
renew 1
his 1
grief 1
by 1
a 1
recital 1
of 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
greatest 1
eagerness 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
promised 1
narrative 1
partly 1
from 1
curiosity 1
and 1
partly 1
from 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
to 1
ameliorate 1
his 1
fate 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
i 1
expressed 1
these 1
feelings 1
in 1
my 1
answer 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
he 1
replied 1
for 1
your 1
sympathy 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
useless 1
my 1
fate 1
is 1
nearly 1
fulfilled 1
i 1
wait 1
but 1
for 1
one 1
event 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
repose 1
in 1
peace 1
i 1
understand 1
your 1
feeling 1
continued 1
he 1
perceiving 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
interrupt 1
him 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
my 1
friend 1
if 1
thus 1
you 1
will 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
name 1
you 1
nothing 1
can 1
alter 1
my 1
destiny 1
listen 1
to 1
my 1
history 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
perceive 1
how 1
irrevocably 1
it 1
is 1
determined 1
he 1
then 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
commence 1
his 1
narrative 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
when 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
leisure 1
this 1
promise 1
drew 1
from 1
me 1
the 1
warmest 1
thanks 1
i 1
have 1
resolved 1
every 1
night 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
imperatively 1
occupied 1
by 1
my 1
duties 1
to 1
record 1
as 1
nearly 1
as 1
possible 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
words 1
what 1
he 1
has 1
related 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
if 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
engaged 1
i 1
will 1
at 1
least 1
make 1
notes 1
this 1
manuscript 1
will 1
doubtless 1
afford 1
you 1
the 1
greatest 1
pleasure 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
who 1
know 1
him 1
and 1
who 1
hear 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
lips 1
with 1
what 1
interest 1
and 1
sympathy 1
shall 1
i 1
read 1
it 1
in 1
some 1
future 1
day 1
even 1
now 1
as 1
i 1
commence 1
my 1
task 1
his 1
full 1
toned 1
voice 1
swells 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
his 1
lustrous 1
eyes 1
dwell 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
all 1
their 1
melancholy 1
sweetness 1
i 1
see 1
his 1
thin 1
hand 1
raised 1
in 1
animation 1
while 1
the 1
lineaments 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
are 1
irradiated 1
by 1
the 1
soul 1
within 1
strange 1
and 1
harrowing 1
must 1
be 1
his 1
story 1
frightful 1
the 1
storm 1
which 1
embraced 1
the 1
gallant 1
vessel 1
on 1
its 1
course 1
and 1
wrecked 1
it 1
thus 1
chapter 1
1 1
i 1
am 1
by 1
birth 1
a 1
genevese 1
and 1
my 1
family 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
of 1
that 1
republic 1
my 1
ancestors 1
had 1
been 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
counsellors 1
and 1
syndics 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
filled 1
several 1
public 1
situations 1
with 1
honour 1
and 1
reputation 1
he 1
was 1
respected 1
by 1
all 1
who 1
knew 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
integrity 1
and 1
indefatigable 1
attention 1
to 1
public 1
business 1
he 1
passed 1
his 1
younger 1
days 1
perpetually 1
occupied 1
by 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
circumstances 1
had 1
prevented 1
his 1
marrying 1
early 1
nor 1
was 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
life 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
husband 1
and 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
a 1
family 1
as 1
the 1
circumstances 1
of 1
his 1
marriage 1
illustrate 1
his 1
character 1
i 1
cannot 1
refrain 1
from 1
relating 1
them 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
most 1
intimate 1
friends 1
was 1
a 1
merchant 1
who 1
from 1
a 1
flourishing 1
state 1
fell 1
through 1
numerous 1
mischances 1
into 1
poverty 1
this 1
man 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
beaufort 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
proud 1
and 1
unbending 1
disposition 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
poverty 1
and 1
oblivion 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
country 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
distinguished 1
for 1
his 1
rank 1
and 1
magnificence 1
having 1
paid 1
his 1
debts 1
therefore 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
honourable 1
manner 1
he 1
retreated 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
of 1
lucerne 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
unknown 1
and 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
my 1
father 1
loved 1
beaufort 1
with 1
the 1
truest 1
friendship 1
and 1
was 1
deeply 1
grieved 1
by 1
his 1
retreat 1
in 1
these 1
unfortunate 1
circumstances 1
he 1
bitterly 1
deplored 1
the 1
false 1
pride 1
which 1
led 1
his 1
friend 1
to 1
a 1
conduct 1
so 1
little 1
worthy 1
of 1
the 1
affection 1
that 1
united 1
them 1
he 1
lost 1
no 1
time 1
in 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
seek 1
him 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
persuading 1
him 1
to 1
begin 1
the 1
world 1
again 1
through 1
his 1
credit 1
and 1
assistance 1
beaufort 1
had 1
taken 1
effectual 1
measures 1
to 1
conceal 1
himself 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
ten 1
months 1
before 1
my 1
father 1
discovered 1
his 1
abode 1
overjoyed 1
at 1
this 1
discovery 1
he 1
hastened 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
was 1
situated 1
in 1
a 1
mean 1
street 1
near 1
the 1
reuss 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
misery 1
and 1
despair 1
alone 1
welcomed 1
him 1
beaufort 1
had 1
saved 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
small 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
from 1
the 1
wreck 1
of 1
his 1
fortunes 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
sufficient 1
to 1
provide 1
him 1
with 1
sustenance 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
hoped 1
to 1
procure 1
some 1
respectable 1
employment 1
in 1
a 1
merchant 1
s 1
house 1
the 1
interval 1
was 1
consequently 1
spent 1
in 1
inaction 1
his 1
grief 1
only 1
became 1
more 1
deep 1
and 1
rankling 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
leisure 1
for 1
reflection 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
it 1
took 1
so 1
fast 1
hold 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
three 1
months 1
he 1
lay 1
on 1
a 1
bed 1
of 1
sickness 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
exertion 1
his 1
daughter 1
attended 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
tenderness 1
but 1
she 1
saw 1
with 1
despair 1
that 1
their 1
little 1
fund 1
was 1
rapidly 1
decreasing 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
prospect 1
of 1
support 1
but 1
caroline 1
beaufort 1
possessed 1
a 1
mind 1
of 1
an 1
uncommon 1
mould 1
and 1
her 1
courage 1
rose 1
to 1
support 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
adversity 1
she 1
procured 1
plain 1
work 1
she 1
plaited 1
straw 1
and 1
by 1
various 1
means 1
contrived 1
to 1
earn 1
a 1
pittance 1
scarcely 1
sufficient 1
to 1
support 1
life 1
several 1
months 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
her 1
father 1
grew 1
worse 1
her 1
time 1
was 1
more 1
entirely 1
occupied 1
in 1
attending 1
him 1
her 1
means 1
of 1
subsistence 1
decreased 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
tenth 1
month 1
her 1
father 1
died 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
leaving 1
her 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
beggar 1
this 1
last 1
blow 1
overcame 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
knelt 1
by 1
beaufort 1
s 1
coffin 1
weeping 1
bitterly 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
the 1
chamber 1
he 1
came 1
like 1
a 1
protecting 1
spirit 1
to 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
who 1
committed 1
herself 1
to 1
his 1
care 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
interment 1
of 1
his 1
friend 1
he 1
conducted 1
her 1
to 1
geneva 1
and 1
placed 1
her 1
under 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
a 1
relation 1
two 1
years 1
after 1
this 1
event 1
caroline 1
became 1
his 1
wife 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
difference 1
between 1
the 1
ages 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
but 1
this 1
circumstance 1
seemed 1
to 1
unite 1
them 1
only 1
closer 1
in 1
bonds 1
of 1
devoted 1
affection 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
justice 1
in 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
upright 1
mind 1
which 1
rendered 1
it 1
necessary 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
approve 1
highly 1
to 1
love 1
strongly 1
perhaps 1
during 1
former 1
years 1
he 1
had 1
suffered 1
from 1
the 1
late 1
discovered 1
unworthiness 1
of 1
one 1
beloved 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
disposed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
greater 1
value 1
on 1
tried 1
worth 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
show 1
of 1
gratitude 1
and 1
worship 1
in 1
his 1
attachment 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
differing 1
wholly 1
from 1
the 1
doting 1
fondness 1
of 1
age 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
inspired 1
by 1
reverence 1
for 1
her 1
virtues 1
and 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
recompensing 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
sorrows 1
she 1
had 1
endured 1
but 1
which 1
gave 1
inexpressible 1
grace 1
to 1
his 1
behaviour 1
to 1
her 1
everything 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
her 1
wishes 1
and 1
her 1
convenience 1
he 1
strove 1
to 1
shelter 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
fair 1
exotic 1
is 1
sheltered 1
by 1
the 1
gardener 1
from 1
every 1
rougher 1
wind 1
and 1
to 1
surround 1
her 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
could 1
tend 1
to 1
excite 1
pleasurable 1
emotion 1
in 1
her 1
soft 1
and 1
benevolent 1
mind 1
her 1
health 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
tranquillity 1
of 1
her 1
hitherto 1
constant 1
spirit 1
had 1
been 1
shaken 1
by 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
through 1
during 1
the 1
two 1
years 1
that 1
had 1
elapsed 1
previous 1
to 1
their 1
marriage 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
gradually 1
relinquished 1
all 1
his 1
public 1
functions 1
and 1
immediately 1
after 1
their 1
union 1
they 1
sought 1
the 1
pleasant 1
climate 1
of 1
italy 1
and 1
the 1
change 1
of 1
scene 1
and 1
interest 1
attendant 1
on 1
a 1
tour 1
through 1
that 1
land 1
of 1
wonders 1
as 1
a 1
restorative 1
for 1
her 1
weakened 1
frame 1
from 1
italy 1
they 1
visited 1
germany 1
and 1
france 1
i 1
their 1
eldest 1
child 1
was 1
born 1
at 1
naples 1
and 1
as 1
an 1
infant 1
accompanied 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
rambles 1
i 1
remained 1
for 1
several 1
years 1
their 1
only 1
child 1
much 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
attached 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
draw 1
inexhaustible 1
stores 1
of 1
affection 1
from 1
a 1
very 1
mine 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
bestow 1
them 1
upon 1
me 1
my 1
mother 1
s 1
tender 1
caresses 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
smile 1
of 1
benevolent 1
pleasure 1
while 1
regarding 1
me 1
are 1
my 1
first 1
recollections 1
i 1
was 1
their 1
plaything 1
and 1
their 1
idol 1
and 1
something 1
better 1
their 1
child 1
the 1
innocent 1
and 1
helpless 1
creature 1
bestowed 1
on 1
them 1
by 1
heaven 1
whom 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
to 1
good 1
and 1
whose 1
future 1
lot 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
to 1
direct 1
to 1
happiness 1
or 1
misery 1
according 1
as 1
they 1
fulfilled 1
their 1
duties 1
towards 1
me 1
with 1
this 1
deep 1
consciousness 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
owed 1
towards 1
the 1
being 1
to 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
given 1
life 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
active 1
spirit 1
of 1
tenderness 1
that 1
animated 1
both 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
imagined 1
that 1
while 1
during 1
every 1
hour 1
of 1
my 1
infant 1
life 1
i 1
received 1
a 1
lesson 1
of 1
patience 1
of 1
charity 1
and 1
of 1
self 1
control 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
guided 1
by 1
a 1
silken 1
cord 1
that 1
all 1
seemed 1
but 1
one 1
train 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
their 1
only 1
care 1
my 1
mother 1
had 1
much 1
desired 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
daughter 1
but 1
i 1
continued 1
their 1
single 1
offspring 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
years 1
old 1
while 1
making 1
an 1
excursion 1
beyond 1
the 1
frontiers 1
of 1
italy 1
they 1
passed 1
a 1
week 1
on 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
of 1
como 1
their 1
benevolent 1
disposition 1
often 1
made 1
them 1
enter 1
the 1
cottages 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
this 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
duty 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
necessity 1
a 1
passion 1
remembering 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
suffered 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
relieved 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
act 1
in 1
her 1
turn 1
the 1
guardian 1
angel 1
to 1
the 1
afflicted 1
during 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
walks 1
a 1
poor 1
cot 1
in 1
the 1
foldings 1
of 1
a 1
vale 1
attracted 1
their 1
notice 1
as 1
being 1
singularly 1
disconsolate 1
while 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
half 1
clothed 1
children 1
gathered 1
about 1
it 1
spoke 1
of 1
penury 1
in 1
its 1
worst 1
shape 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
himself 1
to 1
milan 1
my 1
mother 1
accompanied 1
by 1
me 1
visited 1
this 1
abode 1
she 1
found 1
a 1
peasant 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
hard 1
working 1
bent 1
down 1
by 1
care 1
and 1
labour 1
distributing 1
a 1
scanty 1
meal 1
to 1
five 1
hungry 1
babes 1
among 1
these 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
attracted 1
my 1
mother 1
far 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
she 1
appeared 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
stock 1
the 1
four 1
others 1
were 1
dark 1
eyed 1
hardy 1
little 1
vagrants 1
this 1
child 1
was 1
thin 1
and 1
very 1
fair 1
her 1
hair 1
was 1
the 1
brightest 1
living 1
gold 1
and 1
despite 1
the 1
poverty 1
of 1
her 1
clothing 1
seemed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
crown 1
of 1
distinction 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
her 1
brow 1
was 1
clear 1
and 1
ample 1
her 1
blue 1
eyes 1
cloudless 1
and 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
the 1
moulding 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
so 1
expressive 1
of 1
sensibility 1
and 1
sweetness 1
that 1
none 1
could 1
behold 1
her 1
without 1
looking 1
on 1
her 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
distinct 1
species 1
a 1
being 1
heaven 1
sent 1
and 1
bearing 1
a 1
celestial 1
stamp 1
in 1
all 1
her 1
features 1
the 1
peasant 1
woman 1
perceiving 1
that 1
my 1
mother 1
fixed 1
eyes 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
admiration 1
on 1
this 1
lovely 1
girl 1
eagerly 1
communicated 1
her 1
history 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
child 1
but 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
milanese 1
nobleman 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
german 1
and 1
had 1
died 1
on 1
giving 1
her 1
birth 1
the 1
infant 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
with 1
these 1
good 1
people 1
to 1
nurse 1
they 1
were 1
better 1
off 1
then 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
long 1
married 1
and 1
their 1
eldest 1
child 1
was 1
but 1
just 1
born 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
their 1
charge 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
italians 1
nursed 1
in 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
antique 1
glory 1
of 1
italy 1
one 1
among 1
the 1
schiavi 1
ognor 1
frementi 1
who 1
exerted 1
himself 1
to 1
obtain 1
the 1
liberty 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
he 1
became 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
its 1
weakness 1
whether 1
he 1
had 1
died 1
or 1
still 1
lingered 1
in 1
the 1
dungeons 1
of 1
austria 1
was 1
not 1
known 1
his 1
property 1
was 1
confiscated 1
his 1
child 1
became 1
an 1
orphan 1
and 1
a 1
beggar 1
she 1
continued 1
with 1
her 1
foster 1
parents 1
and 1
bloomed 1
in 1
their 1
rude 1
abode 1
fairer 1
than 1
a 1
garden 1
rose 1
among 1
dark 1
leaved 1
brambles 1
when 1
my 1
father 1
returned 1
from 1
milan 1
he 1
found 1
playing 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
our 1
villa 1
a 1
child 1
fairer 1
than 1
pictured 1
cherub 1
a 1
creature 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
shed 1
radiance 1
from 1
her 1
looks 1
and 1
whose 1
form 1
and 1
motions 1
were 1
lighter 1
than 1
the 1
chamois 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
the 1
apparition 1
was 1
soon 1
explained 1
with 1
his 1
permission 1
my 1
mother 1
prevailed 1
on 1
her 1
rustic 1
guardians 1
to 1
yield 1
their 1
charge 1
to 1
her 1
they 1
were 1
fond 1
of 1
the 1
sweet 1
orphan 1
her 1
presence 1
had 1
seemed 1
a 1
blessing 1
to 1
them 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
unfair 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
in 1
poverty 1
and 1
want 1
when 1
providence 1
afforded 1
her 1
such 1
powerful 1
protection 1
they 1
consulted 1
their 1
village 1
priest 1
and 1
the 1
result 1
was 1
that 1
elizabeth 1
lavenza 1
became 1
the 1
inmate 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
house 1
my 1
more 1
than 1
sister 1
the 1
beautiful 1
and 1
adored 1
companion 1
of 1
all 1
my 1
occupations 1
and 1
my 1
pleasures 1
everyone 1
loved 1
elizabeth 1
the 1
passionate 1
and 1
almost 1
reverential 1
attachment 1
with 1
which 1
all 1
regarded 1
her 1
became 1
while 1
i 1
shared 1
it 1
my 1
pride 1
and 1
my 1
delight 1
on 1
the 1
evening 1
previous 1
to 1
her 1
being 1
brought 1
to 1
my 1
home 1
my 1
mother 1
had 1
said 1
playfully 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
pretty 1
present 1
for 1
my 1
victor 1
tomorrow 1
he 1
shall 1
have 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
she 1
presented 1
elizabeth 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
her 1
promised 1
gift 1
i 1
with 1
childish 1
seriousness 1
interpreted 1
her 1
words 1
literally 1
and 1
looked 1
upon 1
elizabeth 1
as 1
mine 1
mine 1
to 1
protect 1
love 1
and 1
cherish 1
all 1
praises 1
bestowed 1
on 1
her 1
i 1
received 1
as 1
made 1
to 1
a 1
possession 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
we 1
called 1
each 1
other 1
familiarly 1
by 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
cousin 1
no 1
word 1
no 1
expression 1
could 1
body 1
forth 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
relation 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
stood 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
more 1
than 1
sister 1
since 1
till 1
death 1

we 1
were 1
brought 1
up 1
together 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
quite 1
a 1
year 1
difference 1
in 1
our 1
ages 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
strangers 1
to 1
any 1
species 1
of 1
disunion 1
or 1
dispute 1
harmony 1
was 1
the 1
soul 1
of 1
our 1
companionship 1
and 1
the 1
diversity 1
and 1
contrast 1
that 1
subsisted 1
in 1
our 1
characters 1
drew 1
us 1
nearer 1
together 1
elizabeth 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
calmer 1
and 1
more 1
concentrated 1
disposition 1
but 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
ardour 1
i 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
a 1
more 1
intense 1
application 1
and 1
was 1
more 1
deeply 1
smitten 1
with 1
the 1
thirst 1
for 1
knowledge 1
she 1
busied 1
herself 1
with 1
following 1
the 1
aerial 1
creations 1
of 1
the 1
poets 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
majestic 1
and 1
wondrous 1
scenes 1
which 1
surrounded 1
our 1
swiss 1
home 1
the 1
sublime 1
shapes 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
the 1
changes 1
of 1
the 1
seasons 1
tempest 1
and 1
calm 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
winter 1
and 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
turbulence 1
of 1
our 1
alpine 1
summers 1
she 1
found 1
ample 1
scope 1
for 1
admiration 1
and 1
delight 1
while 1
my 1
companion 1
contemplated 1
with 1
a 1
serious 1
and 1
satisfied 1
spirit 1
the 1
magnificent 1
appearances 1
of 1
things 1
i 1
delighted 1
in 1
investigating 1
their 1
causes 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
secret 1
which 1
i 1
desired 1
to 1
divine 1
curiosity 1
earnest 1
research 1
to 1
learn 1
the 1
hidden 1
laws 1
of 1
nature 1

akin 1
to 1
rapture 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
unfolded 1
to 1
me 1
are 1
among 1
the 1
earliest 1
sensations 1
i 1
can 1
remember 1
on 1
the 1
birth 1
of 1
a 1
second 1
son 1
my 1
junior 1
by 1
seven 1
years 1
my 1
parents 1
gave 1
up 1
entirely 1
their 1
wandering 1
life 1
and 1
fixed 1
themselves 1
in 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
we 1
possessed 1
a 1
house 1
in 1
geneva 1
and 1
a 1
campagne 1
on 1
belrive 1
the 1
eastern 1
shore 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
rather 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
the 1
city 1
we 1
resided 1
principally 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
and 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
my 1
parents 1
were 1
passed 1
in 1
considerable 1
seclusion 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
temper 1
to 1
avoid 1
a 1
crowd 1
and 1
to 1
attach 1
myself 1
fervently 1
to 1
a 1
few 1
i 1
was 1
indifferent 1
therefore 1
to 1
my 1
school 1
fellows 1
in 1
general 1
but 1
i 1
united 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
bonds 1
of 1
the 1
closest 1
friendship 1
to 1
one 1
among 1
them 1
henry 1
clerval 1
was 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
a 1
merchant 1
of 1
geneva 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
of 1
singular 1
talent 1
and 1
fancy 1
he 1
loved 1
enterprise 1
hardship 1
and 1
even 1
danger 1
for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
read 1
in 1
books 1
of 1
chivalry 1
and 1
romance 1
he 1
composed 1
heroic 1
songs 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
write 1
many 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
enchantment 1
and 1
knightly 1
adventure 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
us 1
act 1
plays 1
and 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
masquerades 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
characters 1
were 1
drawn 1
from 1
the 1
heroes 1
of 1
roncesvalles 1
of 1
the 1
round 1
table 1
of 1
king 1
arthur 1
and 1
the 1
chivalrous 1
train 1
who 1
shed 1
their 1
blood 1
to 1
redeem 1
the 1
holy 1
sepulchre 1
from 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
infidels 1
no 1
human 1
being 1
could 1
have 1
passed 1
a 1
happier 1
childhood 1
than 1
myself 1
my 1
parents 1
were 1
possessed 1
by 1
the 1
very 1
spirit 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
indulgence 1
we 1
felt 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
the 1
tyrants 1
to 1
rule 1
our 1
lot 1
according 1
to 1
their 1
caprice 1
but 1
the 1
agents 1
and 1
creators 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
many 1
delights 1
which 1
we 1
enjoyed 1
when 1
i 1
mingled 1
with 1
other 1
families 1
i 1
distinctly 1
discerned 1
how 1
peculiarly 1
fortunate 1
my 1
lot 1
was 1
and 1
gratitude 1
assisted 1
the 1
development 1
of 1
filial 1
love 1
my 1
temper 1
was 1
sometimes 1
violent 1
and 1
my 1
passions 1
vehement 1
but 1
by 1
some 1
law 1
in 1
my 1
temperature 1
they 1
were 1
turned 1
not 1
towards 1
childish 1
pursuits 1
but 1
to 1
an 1
eager 1
desire 1
to 1
learn 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
learn 1
all 1
things 1
indiscriminately 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
neither 1
the 1
structure 1
of 1
languages 1
nor 1
the 1
code 1
of 1
governments 1
nor 1
the 1
politics 1
of 1
various 1
states 1
possessed 1
attractions 1
for 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
earth 1
that 1
i 1
desired 1
to 1
learn 1
and 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
outward 1
substance 1
of 1
things 1
or 1
the 1
inner 1
spirit 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
mysterious 1
soul 1
of 1
man 1
that 1
occupied 1
me 1
still 1
my 1
inquiries 1
were 1
directed 1
to 1
the 1
metaphysical 1
or 1
in 1
its 1
highest 1
sense 1
the 1
physical 1
secrets 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
meanwhile 1
clerval 1
occupied 1
himself 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
the 1
moral 1
relations 1
of 1
things 1
the 1
busy 1
stage 1
of 1
life 1
the 1
virtues 1
of 1
heroes 1
and 1
the 1
actions 1
of 1
men 1
were 1
his 1
theme 1
and 1
his 1
hope 1
and 1
his 1
dream 1
was 1
to 1
become 1
one 1
among 1
those 1
whose 1
names 1
are 1
recorded 1
in 1
story 1
as 1
the 1
gallant 1
and 1
adventurous 1
benefactors 1
of 1
our 1
species 1
the 1
saintly 1
soul 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
shone 1
like 1
a 1
shrine 1
dedicated 1
lamp 1
in 1
our 1
peaceful 1
home 1
her 1
sympathy 1
was 1
ours 1
her 1
smile 1
her 1
soft 1
voice 1
the 1
sweet 1
glance 1
of 1
her 1
celestial 1
eyes 1
were 1
ever 1
there 1
to 1
bless 1
and 1
animate 1
us 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
living 1
spirit 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
soften 1
and 1
attract 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
become 1
sullen 1
in 1
my 1
study 1
rought 1
through 1
the 1
ardour 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
but 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
to 1
subdue 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
semblance 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
gentleness 1
and 1
clerval 1
could 1
aught 1
ill 1
entrench 1
on 1
the 1
noble 1
spirit 1
of 1
clerval 1
yet 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
perfectly 1
humane 1
so 1
thoughtful 1
in 1
his 1
generosity 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
tenderness 1
amidst 1
his 1
passion 1
for 1
adventurous 1
exploit 1
had 1
she 1
not 1
unfolded 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
real 1
loveliness 1
of 1
beneficence 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
doing 1
good 1
the 1
end 1
and 1
aim 1
of 1
his 1
soaring 1
ambition 1
i 1
feel 1
exquisite 1
pleasure 1
in 1
dwelling 1
on 1
the 1
recollections 1
of 1
childhood 1
before 1
misfortune 1
had 1
tainted 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
changed 1
its 1
bright 1
visions 1
of 1
extensive 1
usefulness 1
into 1
gloomy 1
and 1
narrow 1
reflections 1
upon 1
self 1
besides 1
in 1
drawing 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
early 1
days 1
i 1
also 1
record 1
those 1
events 1
which 1
led 1
by 1
insensible 1
steps 1
to 1
my 1
after 1
tale 1
of 1
misery 1
for 1
when 1
i 1
would 1
account 1
to 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
birth 1
of 1
that 1
passion 1
which 1
afterwards 1
ruled 1
my 1
destiny 1
i 1
find 1
it 1
arise 1
like 1
a 1
mountain 1
river 1
from 1
ignoble 1
and 1
almost 1
forgotten 1
sources 1
but 1
swelling 1
as 1
it 1
proceeded 1
it 1
became 1
the 1
torrent 1
which 1
in 1
its 1
course 1
has 1
swept 1
away 1
all 1
my 1
hopes 1
and 1
joys 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
is 1
the 1
genius 1
that 1
has 1
regulated 1
my 1
fate 1
i 1
desire 1
therefore 1
in 1
this 1
narration 1
to 1
state 1
those 1
facts 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
my 1
predilection 1
for 1
that 1
science 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
thirteen 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
we 1
all 1
went 1
on 1
a 1
party 1
of 1
pleasure 1
to 1
the 1
baths 1
near 1
thonon 1
the 1
inclemency 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
obliged 1
us 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
day 1
confined 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
in 1
this 1
house 1
i 1
chanced 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
volume 1
of 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
i 1
opened 1
it 1
with 1
apathy 1
the 1
theory 1
which 1
he 1
attempts 1
to 1
demonstrate 1
and 1
the 1
wonderful 1
facts 1
which 1
he 1
relates 1
soon 1
changed 1
this 1
feeling 1
into 1
enthusiasm 1
a 1
new 1
light 1
seemed 1
to 1
dawn 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
bounding 1
with 1
joy 1
i 1
communicated 1
my 1
discovery 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
my 1
father 1
looked 1
carelessly 1
at 1
the 1
title 1
page 1
of 1
my 1
book 1
and 1
said 1
ah 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
do 1
not 1
waste 1
your 1
time 1
upon 1
this 1
it 1
is 1
sad 1
trash 1
if 1
instead 1
of 1
this 1
remark 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
pains 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
principles 1
of 1
agrippa 1
had 1
been 1
entirely 1
exploded 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
modern 1
system 1
of 1
science 1
had 1
been 1
introduced 1
which 1
possessed 1
much 1
greater 1
powers 1
than 1
the 1
ancient 1
because 1
the 1
powers 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
were 1
chimerical 1
while 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
former 1
were 1
real 1
and 1
practical 1
under 1
such 1
circumstances 1
i 1
should 1
certainly 1
have 1
thrown 1
agrippa 1
aside 1
and 1
have 1
contented 1
my 1
imagination 1
warmed 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
returning 1
with 1
greater 1
ardour 1
to 1
my 1
former 1
studies 1
it 1
is 1
even 1
possible 1
that 1
the 1
train 1
of 1
my 1
ideas 1
would 1
never 1
have 1
received 1
the 1
fatal 1
impulse 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
my 1
ruin 1
but 1
the 1
cursory 1
glance 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
of 1
my 1
volume 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
acquainted 1
with 1
its 1
contents 1
and 1
i 1
continued 1
to 1
read 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
avidity 1
when 1
i 1
returned 1
home 1
my 1
first 1
care 1
was 1
to 1
procure 1
the 1
whole 1
works 1
of 1
this 1
author 1
and 1
afterwards 1
of 1
paracelsus 1
and 1
albertus 1
magnus 1
i 1
read 1
and 1
studied 1
the 1
wild 1
fancies 1
of 1
these 1
writers 1
with 1
delight 1
they 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
treasures 1
known 1
to 1
few 1
besides 1
myself 1
i 1
have 1
described 1
myself 1
as 1
always 1
having 1
been 1
imbued 1
with 1
a 1
fervent 1
longing 1
to 1
penetrate 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
nature 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
intense 1
labour 1
and 1
wonderful 1
discoveries 1
of 1
modern 1
philosophers 1
i 1
always 1
came 1
from 1
my 1
studies 1
discontented 1
and 1
unsatisfied 1
sir 1
isaac 1
newton 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
avowed 1
that 1
he 1
felt 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
picking 1
up 1
shells 1
beside 1
the 1
great 1
and 1
unexplored 1
ocean 1
of 1
truth 1
those 1
of 1
his 1
successors 1
in 1
each 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
was 1
acquainted 1
appeared 1
even 1
to 1
my 1
boy 1
s 1
apprehensions 1
as 1
tyros 1
engaged 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
pursuit 1
the 1
untaught 1
peasant 1
beheld 1
the 1
elements 1
around 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
acquainted 1
with 1
their 1
practical 1
uses 1
the 1
most 1
learned 1
philosopher 1
knew 1
little 1
more 1
he 1
had 1
partially 1
unveiled 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
nature 1
but 1
her 1
immortal 1
lineaments 1
were 1
still 1
a 1
wonder 1
and 1
a 1
mystery 1
he 1
might 1
dissect 1
anatomize 1
and 1
give 1
names 1
but 1
not 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
a 1
final 1
cause 1
causes 1
in 1
their 1
secondary 1
and 1
tertiary 1
grades 1
were 1
utterly 1
unknown 1
to 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
gazed 1
upon 1
the 1
fortifications 1
and 1
impediments 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
keep 1
human 1
beings 1
from 1
entering 1
the 1
citadel 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
rashly 1
and 1
ignorantly 1
i 1
had 1
repined 1
but 1
here 1
were 1
books 1
and 1
here 1
were 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
penetrated 1
deeper 1
and 1
knew 1
more 1
i 1
took 1
their 1
word 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
they 1
averred 1
and 1
i 1
became 1
their 1
disciple 1
it 1
may 1
appear 1
strange 1
that 1
such 1
should 1
arise 1
in 1
the 1
eighteenth 1
century 1
but 1
while 1
i 1
followed 1
the 1
routine 1
of 1
education 1
in 1
the 1
schools 1
of 1
geneva 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
degree 1
self 1
taught 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
my 1
favourite 1
studies 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
not 1
scientific 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
struggle 1
with 1
a 1
child 1
s 1
blindness 1
added 1
to 1
a 1
student 1
s 1
thirst 1
for 1
knowledge 1
under 1
the 1
guidance 1
of 1
my 1
new 1
preceptors 1
i 1
entered 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
diligence 1
into 1
the 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
philosopher 1
s 1
stone 1
and 1
the 1
elixir 1
of 1
life 1
but 1
the 1
latter 1
soon 1
obtained 1
my 1
undivided 1
attention 1
wealth 1
was 1
an 1
inferior 1
object 1
but 1
what 1
glory 1
would 1
attend 1
the 1
discovery 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
banish 1
disease 1
from 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
and 1
render 1
man 1
invulnerable 1
to 1
any 1
but 1
a 1
violent 1
death 1
nor 1
were 1
these 1
my 1
only 1
visions 1
the 1
raising 1
of 1
ghosts 1
or 1
devils 1
was 1
a 1
promise 1
liberally 1
accorded 1
by 1
my 1
favourite 1
authors 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
most 1
eagerly 1
sought 1
and 1
if 1
my 1
incantations 1
were 1
always 1
unsuccessful 1
i 1
attributed 1
the 1
failure 1
rather 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
inexperience 1
and 1
mistake 1
than 1
to 1
a 1
want 1
of 1
skill 1
or 1
fidelity 1
in 1
my 1
instructors 1
and 1
thus 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
exploded 1
systems 1
mingling 1
like 1
an 1
unadept 1
a 1
thousand 1
contradictory 1
theories 1
and 1
floundering 1
desperately 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
slough 1
of 1
multifarious 1
knowledge 1
guided 1
by 1
an 1
ardent 1
imagination 1
and 1
childish 1
reasoning 1
till 1
an 1
accident 1
again 1
changed 1
the 1
current 1
of 1
my 1
ideas 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
fifteen 1
years 1
old 1
we 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
our 1
house 1
near 1
belrive 1
when 1
we 1
witnessed 1
a 1
most 1
violent 1
and 1
terrible 1
thunderstorm 1
it 1
advanced 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
jura 1
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
burst 1
at 1
once 1
with 1
frightful 1
loudness 1
from 1
various 1
quarters 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
i 1
remained 1
while 1
the 1
storm 1
lasted 1
watching 1
its 1
progress 1
with 1
curiosity 1
and 1
delight 1
as 1
i 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
on 1
a 1
sudden 1
i 1
beheld 1
a 1
stream 1
of 1
fire 1
issue 1
from 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
beautiful 1
oak 1
which 1
stood 1
about 1
twenty 1
yards 1
from 1
our 1
house 1
and 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
dazzling 1
light 1
vanished 1
the 1
oak 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
nothing 1
remained 1
but 1
a 1
blasted 1
stump 1
when 1
we 1
visited 1
it 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
tree 1
shattered 1
in 1
a 1
singular 1
manner 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
splintered 1
by 1
the 1
shock 1
but 1
entirely 1
reduced 1
to 1
thin 1
ribbons 1
of 1
wood 1
i 1
never 1
beheld 1
anything 1
so 1
utterly 1
destroyed 1
before 1
this 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
more 1
obvious 1
laws 1
of 1
electricity 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
great 1
research 1
in 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
was 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
excited 1
by 1
this 1
catastrophe 1
he 1
entered 1
on 1
the 1
explanation 1
of 1
a 1
theory 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
electricity 1
and 1
galvanism 1
which 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
new 1
and 1
astonishing 1
to 1
me 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
threw 1
greatly 1
into 1
the 1
shade 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
albertus 1
magnus 1
and 1
paracelsus 1
the 1
lords 1
of 1
my 1
imagination 1
but 1
by 1
some 1
fatality 1
the 1
overthrow 1
of 1
these 1
men 1
disinclined 1
me 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
accustomed 1
studies 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
nothing 1
would 1
or 1
could 1
ever 1
be 1
known 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
engaged 1
my 1
attention 1
suddenly 1
grew 1
despicable 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
caprices 1
of 1
the 1
mind 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
perhaps 1
most 1
subject 1
to 1
in 1
early 1
youth 1
i 1
at 1
once 1
gave 1
up 1
my 1
former 1
occupations 1
set 1
down 1
natural 1
history 1
and 1
all 1
its 1
progeny 1
as 1
a 1
deformed 1
and 1
abortive 1
creation 1
and 1
entertained 1
the 1
greatest 1
disdain 1
for 1
a 1
would 1
be 1
science 1
which 1
could 1
never 1
even 1
step 1
within 1
the 1
threshold 1
of 1
real 1
knowledge 1
in 1
this 1
mood 1
of 1
mind 1
i 1
betook 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
mathematics 1
and 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
study 1
appertaining 1
to 1
that 1
science 1
as 1
being 1
built 1
upon 1
secure 1
foundations 1
and 1
so 1
worthy 1
of 1
my 1
consideration 1
thus 1
strangely 1
are 1
our 1
souls 1
constructed 1
and 1
by 1
such 1
slight 1
ligaments 1
are 1
we 1
bound 1
to 1
prosperity 1
or 1
ruin 1
when 1
i 1
look 1
back 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
if 1
this 1
almost 1
miraculous 1
change 1
of 1
inclination 1
and 1
will 1
was 1
the 1
immediate 1
suggestion 1
of 1
the 1
guardian 1
angel 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
the 1
last 1
effort 1
made 1
by 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
preservation 1
to 1
avert 1
the 1
storm 1
that 1
was 1
even 1
then 1
hanging 1
in 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
envelop 1
me 1
her 1
victory 1
was 1
announced 1
by 1
an 1
unusual 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
gladness 1
of 1
soul 1
which 1
followed 1
the 1
relinquishing 1
of 1
my 1
ancient 1
and 1
latterly 1
tormenting 1
studies 1
it 1
was 1
thus 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
taught 1
to 1
associate 1
evil 1
with 1
their 1
prosecution 1
happiness 1
with 1
their 1
disregard 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
strong 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
good 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
ineffectual 1
destiny 1
was 1
too 1
potent 1
and 1
her 1
immutable 1
laws 1
had 1
decreed 1
my 1
utter 1
and 1
terrible 1
destruction 1
chapter 1
3 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
attained 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
seventeen 1
my 1
parents 1
resolved 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
become 1
a 1
student 1
at 1
the 1
university 1
of 1
ingolstadt 1
i 1
had 1
hitherto 1
attended 1
the 1
schools 1
of 1
geneva 1
but 1
my 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
education 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
made 1
acquainted 1
with 1
other 1
customs 1
than 1
those 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
my 1
departure 1
was 1
therefore 1
fixed 1
at 1
an 1
early 1
date 1
but 1
before 1
the 1
day 1
resolved 1
upon 1
could 1
arrive 1
the 1
first 1
misfortune 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
occurred 1
an 1
omen 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
of 1
my 1
future 1
misery 1
elizabeth 1
had 1
caught 1
the 1
scarlet 1
fever 1
her 1
illness 1
was 1
severe 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
danger 1
during 1
her 1
illness 1
many 1
arguments 1
had 1
been 1
urged 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
mother 1
to 1
refrain 1
from 1
attending 1
upon 1
her 1
she 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
yielded 1
to 1
our 1
entreaties 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
her 1
favourite 1
was 1
menaced 1
she 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
control 1
her 1
anxiety 1
she 1
attended 1
her 1
sickbed 1
her 1
watchful 1
attentions 1
triumphed 1
over 1
the 1
malignity 1
of 1
the 1
distemper 1
elizabeth 1
was 1
saved 1
but 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
this 1
imprudence 1
were 1
fatal 1
to 1
her 1
preserver 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
day 1
my 1
mother 1
sickened 1
her 1
fever 1
was 1
accompanied 1
by 1
the 1
most 1
alarming 1
symptoms 1
and 1
the 1
looks 1
of 1
her 1
medical 1
attendants 1
prognosticated 1
the 1
worst 1
event 1
on 1
her 1
deathbed 1
the 1
fortitude 1
and 1
benignity 1
of 1
this 1
best 1
of 1
women 1
did 1
not 1
desert 1
her 1
she 1
joined 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
myself 1
my 1
children 1
she 1
said 1
my 1
firmest 1
hopes 1
of 1
future 1
happiness 1
were 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
your 1
union 1
this 1
expectation 1
will 1
now 1
be 1
the 1
consolation 1
of 1
your 1
father 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
love 1
you 1
must 1
supply 1
my 1
place 1
to 1
my 1
younger 1
children 1
alas 1
i 1
regret 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
taken 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
happy 1
and 1
beloved 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
hard 1
to 1
quit 1
you 1
all 1
but 1
these 1
are 1
not 1
thoughts 1
befitting 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
resign 1
myself 1
cheerfully 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
will 1
indulge 1
a 1
hope 1
of 1
meeting 1
you 1
in 1
another 1
world 1
she 1
died 1
calmly 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
affection 1
even 1
in 1
death 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
describe 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
dearest 1
ties 1
are 1
rent 1
by 1
that 1
most 1
irreparable 1
evil 1
the 1
void 1
that 1
presents 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
is 1
exhibited 1
on 1
the 1
countenance 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
mind 1
can 1
persuade 1
itself 1
that 1
she 1
whom 1
we 1
saw 1
every 1
day 1
and 1
whose 1
very 1
existence 1
appeared 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
can 1
have 1
departed 1
forever 1
that 1
the 1
brightness 1
of 1
a 1
beloved 1
eye 1
can 1
have 1
been 1
extinguished 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
voice 1
so 1
familiar 1
and 1
dear 1
to 1
the 1
ear 1
can 1
be 1
hushed 1
never 1
more 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
these 1
are 1
the 1
reflections 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
days 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
lapse 1
of 1
time 1
proves 1
the 1
reality 1
of 1
the 1
evil 1
then 1
the 1
actual 1
bitterness 1
of 1
grief 1
commences 1
yet 1
from 1
whom 1
has 1
not 1
that 1
rude 1
hand 1
rent 1
away 1
some 1
dear 1
connection 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
describe 1
a 1
sorrow 1
which 1
all 1
have 1
felt 1
and 1
must 1
feel 1
the 1
time 1
at 1
length 1
arrives 1
when 1
grief 1
is 1
rather 1
an 1
indulgence 1
than 1
a 1
necessity 1
and 1
the 1
smile 1
that 1
plays 1
upon 1
the 1
lips 1
although 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
deemed 1
a 1
sacrilege 1
is 1
not 1
banished 1
my 1
mother 1
was 1
dead 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
still 1
duties 1
which 1
we 1
ought 1
to 1
perform 1
we 1
must 1
continue 1
our 1
course 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
and 1
learn 1
to 1
think 1
ourselves 1
fortunate 1
whilst 1
one 1
remains 1
whom 1
the 1
spoiler 1
has 1
not 1
seized 1
my 1
departure 1
for 1
ingolstadt 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
deferred 1
by 1
these 1
events 1
was 1
now 1
again 1
determined 1
upon 1
i 1
obtained 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
a 1
respite 1
of 1
some 1
weeks 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
sacrilege 1
so 1
soon 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
repose 1
akin 1
to 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
and 1
to 1
rush 1
into 1
the 1
thick 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
was 1
new 1
to 1
sorrow 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
the 1
less 1
alarm 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
unwilling 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
those 1
that 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
i 1
desired 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
sweet 1
elizabeth 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
consoled 1
she 1
indeed 1
veiled 1
her 1
grief 1
and 1
strove 1
to 1
act 1
the 1
comforter 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
she 1
looked 1
steadily 1
on 1
life 1
and 1
assumed 1
its 1
duties 1
with 1
courage 1
and 1
zeal 1
she 1
devoted 1
herself 1
to 1
those 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
taught 1
to 1
call 1
her 1
uncle 1
and 1
cousins 1
never 1
was 1
she 1
so 1
enchanting 1
as 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
when 1
she 1
recalled 1
the 1
sunshine 1
of 1
her 1
smiles 1
and 1
spent 1
them 1
upon 1
us 1
she 1
forgot 1
even 1
her 1
own 1
regret 1
in 1
her 1
endeavours 1
to 1
make 1
us 1
forget 1
the 1
day 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
at 1
length 1
arrived 1
clerval 1
spent 1
the 1
last 1
evening 1
with 1
us 1
he 1
had 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
persuade 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
accompany 1
me 1
and 1
to 1
become 1
my 1
fellow 1
student 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
his 1
father 1
was 1
a 1
narrow 1
minded 1
trader 1
and 1
saw 1
idleness 1
and 1
ruin 1
in 1
the 1
aspirations 1
and 1
ambition 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
henry 1
deeply 1
felt 1
the 1
misfortune 1
of 1
being 1
debarred 1
from 1
a 1
liberal 1
education 1
he 1
said 1
little 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
spoke 1
i 1
read 1
in 1
his 1
kindling 1
eye 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
animated 1
glance 1
a 1
restrained 1
but 1
firm 1
resolve 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
chained 1
to 1
the 1
miserable 1
details 1
of 1
commerce 1
we 1
sat 1
late 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
tear 1
ourselves 1
away 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
nor 1
persuade 1
ourselves 1
to 1
say 1
the 1
word 1
farewell 1
it 1
was 1
said 1
and 1
we 1
retired 1
under 1
the 1
pretence 1
of 1
seeking 1
repose 1
each 1
fancying 1
that 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
deceived 1
but 1
when 1
at 1
morning 1
s 1
dawn 1
i 1
descended 1
to 1
the 1
carriage 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
there 1
my 1
father 1
again 1
to 1
bless 1
me 1
clerval 1
to 1
press 1
my 1
hand 1
once 1
more 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
to 1
renew 1
her 1
entreaties 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
write 1
often 1
and 1
to 1
bestow 1
the 1
last 1
feminine 1
attentions 1
on 1
her 1
playmate 1
and 1
friend 1
i 1
threw 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
chaise 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
and 1
indulged 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
melancholy 1
reflections 1
i 1
who 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
surrounded 1
by 1
amiable 1
companions 1
continually 1
engaged 1
in 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
bestow 1
mutual 1
pleasure 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
university 1
whither 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
i 1
must 1
form 1
my 1
own 1
friends 1
and 1
be 1
my 1
own 1
protector 1
my 1
life 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
remarkably 1
secluded 1
and 1
domestic 1
and 1
this 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
invincible 1
repugnance 1
to 1
new 1
countenances 1
i 1
loved 1
my 1
brothers 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
clerval 1
these 1
were 1
old 1
familiar 1
faces 1
but 1
i 1
believed 1
myself 1
totally 1
unfitted 1
for 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
strangers 1
such 1
were 1
my 1
reflections 1
as 1
i 1
commenced 1
my 1
journey 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
proceeded 1
my 1
spirits 1
and 1
hopes 1
rose 1
i 1
ardently 1
desired 1
the 1
acquisition 1
of 1
knowledge 1
i 1
had 1
often 1
when 1
at 1
home 1
thought 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
remain 1
during 1
my 1
youth 1
cooped 1
up 1
in 1
one 1
place 1
and 1
had 1
longed 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
take 1
my 1
station 1
among 1
other 1
human 1
beings 1
now 1
my 1
desires 1
were 1
complied 1
with 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
indeed 1
have 1
been 1
folly 1
to 1
repent 1
i 1
had 1
sufficient 1
leisure 1
for 1
these 1
and 1
many 1
other 1
reflections 1
during 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
ingolstadt 1
which 1
was 1
long 1
and 1
fatiguing 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
high 1
white 1
steeple 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
met 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1
alighted 1
and 1
was 1
conducted 1
to 1
my 1
solitary 1
apartment 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
evening 1
as 1
i 1
pleased 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
i 1
delivered 1
my 1
letters 1
of 1
introduction 1
and 1
paid 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
principal 1
professors 1
chance 1
or 1
rather 1
the 1
evil 1
influence 1
the 1
angel 1
of 1
destruction 1
which 1
asserted 1
omnipotent 1
sway 1
over 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
turned 1
my 1
reluctant 1
steps 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
door 1
led 1
me 1
first 1
to 1
m 1
krempe 1
professor 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
he 1
was 1
an 1
uncouth 1
man 1
but 1
deeply 1
imbued 1
in 1
the 1
secrets 1
of 1
his 1
science 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
several 1
questions 1
concerning 1
my 1
progress 1
in 1
the 1
different 1
branches 1
of 1
science 1
appertaining 1
to 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
i 1
replied 1
carelessly 1
and 1
partly 1
in 1
contempt 1
mentioned 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
my 1
alchemists 1
as 1
the 1
principal 1
authors 1
i 1
had 1
studied 1
the 1
professor 1
stared 1
have 1
you 1
he 1
said 1
really 1
spent 1
your 1
time 1
in 1
studying 1
such 1
nonsense 1
i 1
replied 1
in 1
the 1
affirmative 1
every 1
minute 1
continued 1
m 1
krempe 1
with 1
warmth 1
every 1
instant 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
wasted 1
on 1
those 1
books 1
is 1
utterly 1
and 1
entirely 1
lost 1
you 1
have 1
burdened 1
your 1
memory 1
with 1
exploded 1
systems 1
and 1
useless 1
names 1
good 1
god 1
in 1
what 1
desert 1
land 1
have 1
you 1
lived 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
inform 1
you 1
that 1
these 1
fancies 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
greedily 1
imbibed 1
are 1
a 1
thousand 1
years 1
old 1
and 1
as 1
musty 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
ancient 1
i 1
little 1
expected 1
in 1
this 1
enlightened 1
and 1
scientific 1
age 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
disciple 1
of 1
albertus 1
magnus 1
and 1
paracelsus 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
you 1
must 1
begin 1
your 1
studies 1
entirely 1
anew 1
so 1
saying 1
he 1
stepped 1
aside 1
and 1
wrote 1
down 1
a 1
list 1
of 1
several 1
books 1
treating 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
which 1
he 1
desired 1
me 1
to 1
procure 1
and 1
dismissed 1
me 1
after 1
mentioning 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
the 1
following 1
week 1
he 1
intended 1
to 1
commence 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
lectures 1
upon 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
in 1
its 1
general 1
relations 1
and 1
that 1
m 1
waldman 1
a 1
fellow 1
professor 1
would 1
lecture 1
upon 1
chemistry 1
the 1
alternate 1
days 1
that 1
he 1
omitted 1
i 1
returned 1
home 1
not 1
disappointed 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
long 1
considered 1
those 1
authors 1
useless 1
whom 1
the 1
professor 1
reprobated 1
but 1
i 1
returned 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
inclined 1
to 1
recur 1
to 1
these 1
studies 1
in 1
any 1
shape 1
m 1
krempe 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
squat 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
gruff 1
voice 1
and 1
a 1
repulsive 1
countenance 1
the 1
teacher 1
therefore 1
did 1
not 1
prepossess 1
me 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
his 1
pursuits 1
in 1
rather 1
a 1
too 1
philosophical 1
and 1
connected 1
a 1
strain 1
perhaps 1
i 1
have 1
given 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
conclusions 1
i 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
concerning 1
them 1
in 1
my 1
early 1
years 1
as 1
a 1
child 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
content 1
with 1
the 1
results 1
promised 1
by 1
the 1
modern 1
professors 1
of 1
natural 1
science 1
with 1
a 1
confusion 1
of 1
ideas 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
accounted 1
for 1
by 1
my 1
extreme 1
youth 1
and 1
my 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
guide 1
on 1
such 1
matters 1
i 1
had 1
retrod 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
knowledge 1
along 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
exchanged 1
the 1
discoveries 1
of 1
recent 1
inquirers 1
for 1
the 1
dreams 1
of 1
forgotten 1
alchemists 1
besides 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
contempt 1
for 1
the 1
uses 1
of 1
modern 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
different 1
when 1
the 1
masters 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
sought 1
immortality 1
and 1
power 1
such 1
views 1
although 1
futile 1
were 1
grand 1
but 1
now 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
changed 1
the 1
ambition 1
of 1
the 1
inquirer 1
seemed 1
to 1
limit 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
annihilation 1
of 1
those 1
visions 1
on 1
which 1
my 1
interest 1
in 1
science 1
was 1
chiefly 1
founded 1
i 1
was 1
required 1
to 1
exchange 1
chimeras 1
of 1
boundless 1
grandeur 1
for 1
realities 1
of 1
little 1
worth 1
such 1
were 1
my 1
reflections 1
during 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
days 1
of 1
my 1
residence 1
at 1
ingolstadt 1
which 1
were 1
chiefly 1
spent 1
in 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
localities 1
and 1
the 1
principal 1
residents 1
in 1
my 1
new 1
abode 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
ensuing 1
week 1
commenced 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
information 1
which 1
m 1
krempe 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
concerning 1
the 1
lectures 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
consent 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
hear 1
that 1
little 1
conceited 1
fellow 1
deliver 1
sentences 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
pulpit 1
i 1
recollected 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
of 1
m 1
waldman 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
out 1
of 1
town 1
partly 1
from 1
curiosity 1
and 1
partly 1
from 1
idleness 1
i 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
lecturing 1
room 1
which 1
m 1
waldman 1
entered 1
shortly 1
after 1
this 1
professor 1
was 1
very 1
unlike 1
his 1
colleague 1
he 1
appeared 1
about 1
fifty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
but 1
with 1
an 1
aspect 1
expressive 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
benevolence 1
a 1
few 1
grey 1
hairs 1
covered 1
his 1
temples 1
but 1
those 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
were 1
nearly 1
black 1
his 1
person 1
was 1
short 1
but 1
remarkably 1
erect 1
and 1
his 1
voice 1
the 1
sweetest 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
he 1
began 1
his 1
lecture 1
by 1
a 1
recapitulation 1
of 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
chemistry 1
and 1
the 1
various 1
improvements 1
made 1
by 1
different 1
men 1
of 1
learning 1
pronouncing 1
with 1
fervour 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
discoverers 1
he 1
then 1
took 1
a 1
cursory 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
present 1
state 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
and 1
explained 1
many 1
of 1
its 1
elementary 1
terms 1
after 1
having 1
made 1
a 1
few 1
preparatory 1
experiments 1
he 1
concluded 1
with 1
a 1
panegyric 1
upon 1
modern 1
chemistry 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forget 1
the 1
ancient 1
teachers 1
of 1
this 1
science 1
said 1
he 1
promised 1
impossibilities 1
and 1
performed 1
nothing 1
the 1
modern 1
masters 1
promise 1
very 1
little 1
they 1
know 1
that 1
metals 1
cannot 1
be 1
transmuted 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
elixir 1
of 1
life 1
is 1
a 1
chimera 1
but 1
these 1
philosophers 1
whose 1
hands 1
seem 1
only 1
made 1
to 1
dabble 1
in 1
dirt 1
and 1
their 1
eyes 1
to 1
pore 1
over 1
the 1
microscope 1
or 1
crucible 1
have 1
indeed 1
performed 1
miracles 1
they 1
penetrate 1
into 1
the 1
recesses 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
show 1
how 1
she 1
works 1
in 1
her 1
hiding 1
places 1
they 1
ascend 1
into 1
the 1
heavens 1
they 1
have 1
discovered 1
how 1
the 1
blood 1
circulates 1
and 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
air 1
we 1
breathe 1
they 1
have 1
acquired 1
new 1
and 1
almost 1
unlimited 1
powers 1
they 1
can 1
command 1
the 1
thunders 1
of 1
heaven 1
mimic 1
the 1
earthquake 1
and 1
even 1
mock 1
the 1
invisible 1
world 1
with 1
its 1
own 1
shadows 1
such 1
were 1
the 1
professor 1
s 1
words 1
rather 1
let 1
me 1
say 1
such 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
fate 1
enounced 1
to 1
destroy 1
me 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
my 1
soul 1
were 1
grappling 1
with 1
a 1
palpable 1
enemy 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
the 1
various 1
keys 1
were 1
touched 1
which 1
formed 1
the 1
mechanism 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
chord 1
after 1
chord 1
was 1
sounded 1
and 1
soon 1
my 1
mind 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
one 1
thought 1
one 1
conception 1
one 1
purpose 1
so 1
much 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
soul 1
of 1
frankenstein 1
more 1
far 1
more 1
will 1
i 1
achieve 1
treading 1
in 1
the 1
steps 1
already 1
marked 1
i 1
will 1
pioneer 1
a 1
new 1
way 1
explore 1
unknown 1
powers 1
and 1
unfold 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
the 1
deepest 1
mysteries 1
of 1
creation 1
i 1
closed 1
not 1
my 1
eyes 1
that 1
night 1
my 1
internal 1
being 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
insurrection 1
and 1
turmoil 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
order 1
would 1
thence 1
arise 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
power 1
to 1
produce 1
it 1
by 1
degrees 1
after 1
the 1
morning 1
s 1
dawn 1
sleep 1
came 1
i 1
awoke 1
and 1
my 1
yesternight 1
s 1
thoughts 1
were 1
as 1
a 1
dream 1
there 1
only 1
remained 1
a 1
resolution 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
ancient 1
studies 1
and 1
to 1
devote 1
myself 1
to 1
a 1
science 1
for 1
which 1
i 1
believed 1
myself 1
to 1
possess 1
a 1
natural 1
talent 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
day 1
i 1
paid 1
m 1
waldman 1
a 1
visit 1
his 1
manners 1
in 1
private 1
were 1
even 1
more 1
mild 1
and 1
attractive 1
than 1
in 1
public 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
certain 1
dignity 1
in 1
his 1
mien 1
during 1
his 1
lecture 1
which 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
was 1
replaced 1
by 1
the 1
greatest 1
affability 1
and 1
kindness 1
i 1
gave 1
him 1
pretty 1
nearly 1
the 1
same 1
account 1
of 1
my 1
former 1
pursuits 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
given 1
to 1
his 1
fellow 1
professor 1
he 1
heard 1
with 1
attention 1
the 1
little 1
narration 1
concerning 1
my 1
studies 1
and 1
smiled 1
at 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
and 1
paracelsus 1
but 1
without 1
the 1
contempt 1
that 1
m 1
krempe 1
had 1
exhibited 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
these 1
were 1
men 1
to 1
whose 1
indefatigable 1
zeal 1
modern 1
philosophers 1
were 1
indebted 1
for 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
foundations 1
of 1
their 1
knowledge 1
they 1
had 1
left 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
an 1
easier 1
task 1
to 1
give 1
new 1
names 1
and 1
arrange 1
in 1
connected 1
classifications 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
they 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
degree 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
instruments 1
of 1
bringing 1
to 1
light 1
the 1
labours 1
of 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
however 1
erroneously 1
directed 1
scarcely 1
ever 1
fail 1
in 1
ultimately 1
turning 1
to 1
the 1
solid 1
advantage 1
of 1
mankind 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
statement 1
which 1
was 1
delivered 1
without 1
any 1
presumption 1
or 1
affectation 1
and 1
then 1
added 1
that 1
his 1
lecture 1
had 1
removed 1
my 1
prejudices 1
against 1
modern 1
chemists 1
i 1
expressed 1
myself 1
in 1
measured 1
terms 1
with 1
the 1
modesty 1
and 1
deference 1
due 1
from 1
a 1
youth 1
to 1
his 1
instructor 1
without 1
letting 1
escape 1
inexperience 1
in 1
life 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
ashamed 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
stimulated 1
my 1
intended 1
labours 1
i 1
requested 1
his 1
advice 1
concerning 1
the 1
books 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
procure 1
i 1
am 1
happy 1
said 1
m 1
waldman 1
to 1
have 1
gained 1
a 1
disciple 1
and 1
if 1
your 1
application 1
equals 1
your 1
ability 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
of 1
your 1
success 1
chemistry 1
is 1
that 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
greatest 1
improvements 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
may 1
be 1
made 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
it 1
my 1
peculiar 1
study 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
neglected 1
the 1
other 1
branches 1
of 1
science 1
a 1
man 1
would 1
make 1
but 1
a 1
very 1
sorry 1
chemist 1
if 1
he 1
attended 1
to 1
that 1
department 1
of 1
human 1
knowledge 1
alone 1
if 1
your 1
wish 1
is 1
to 1
become 1
really 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
science 1
and 1
not 1
merely 1
a 1
petty 1
experimentalist 1
i 1
should 1
advise 1
you 1
to 1
apply 1
to 1
every 1
branch 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
including 1
mathematics 1
he 1
then 1
took 1
me 1
into 1
his 1
laboratory 1
and 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
uses 1
of 1
his 1
various 1
machines 1
instructing 1
me 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
procure 1
and 1
promising 1
me 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
when 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
advanced 1
far 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
science 1
not 1
to 1
derange 1
their 1
mechanism 1
he 1
also 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
books 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
requested 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
my 1
leave 1
thus 1
ended 1
a 1
day 1
memorable 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
decided 1
my 1
future 1
destiny 1
chapter 1
4 1
from 1
this 1
day 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
and 1
particularly 1
chemistry 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
comprehensive 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
term 1
became 1
nearly 1
my 1
sole 1
occupation 1
i 1
read 1
with 1
ardour 1
those 1
works 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
genius 1
and 1
discrimination 1
which 1
modern 1
inquirers 1
have 1
written 1
on 1
these 1
subjects 1
i 1
attended 1
the 1
lectures 1
and 1
cultivated 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
science 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
even 1
in 1
m 1
krempe 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
sound 1
sense 1
and 1
real 1
information 1
combined 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
with 1
a 1
repulsive 1
physiognomy 1
and 1
manners 1
but 1
not 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
the 1
less 1
valuable 1
in 1
m 1
waldman 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
true 1
friend 1
his 1
gentleness 1
was 1
never 1
tinged 1
by 1
dogmatism 1
and 1
his 1
instructions 1
were 1
given 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
frankness 1
and 1
good 1
nature 1
that 1
banished 1
every 1
idea 1
of 1
pedantry 1
in 1
a 1
thousand 1
ways 1
he 1
smoothed 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
knowledge 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
most 1
abstruse 1
inquiries 1
clear 1
and 1
facile 1
to 1
my 1
apprehension 1
my 1
application 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
fluctuating 1
and 1
uncertain 1
it 1
gained 1
strength 1
as 1
i 1
proceeded 1
and 1
soon 1
became 1
so 1
ardent 1
and 1
eager 1
that 1
the 1
stars 1
often 1
disappeared 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
morning 1
whilst 1
i 1
was 1
yet 1
engaged 1
in 1
my 1
laboratory 1
as 1
i 1
applied 1
so 1
closely 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
easily 1
conceived 1
that 1
my 1
progress 1
was 1
rapid 1
my 1
ardour 1
was 1
indeed 1
the 1
astonishment 1
of 1
the 1
students 1
and 1
my 1
proficiency 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
masters 1
professor 1
krempe 1
often 1
asked 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sly 1
smile 1
how 1
cornelius 1
agrippa 1
went 1
on 1
whilst 1
m 1
waldman 1
expressed 1
the 1
most 1
heartfelt 1
exultation 1
in 1
my 1
progress 1
two 1
years 1
passed 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
paid 1
no 1
visit 1
to 1
geneva 1
but 1
was 1
engaged 1
heart 1
and 1
soul 1
in 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
some 1
discoveries 1
which 1
i 1
hoped 1
to 1
make 1
none 1
but 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
experienced 1
them 1
can 1
conceive 1
of 1
the 1
enticements 1
of 1
science 1
in 1
other 1
studies 1
you 1
go 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
others 1
have 1
gone 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
to 1
know 1
but 1
in 1
a 1
scientific 1
pursuit 1
there 1
is 1
continual 1
food 1
for 1
discovery 1
and 1
wonder 1
a 1
mind 1
of 1
moderate 1
capacity 1
which 1
closely 1
pursues 1
one 1
study 1
must 1
infallibly 1
arrive 1
at 1
great 1
proficiency 1
in 1
that 1
study 1
and 1
i 1
who 1
continually 1
sought 1
the 1
attainment 1
of 1
one 1
object 1
of 1
pursuit 1
and 1
was 1
solely 1
wrapped 1
up 1
in 1
this 1
improved 1
so 1
rapidly 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
two 1
years 1
i 1
made 1
some 1
discoveries 1
in 1
the 1
improvement 1
of 1
some 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
which 1
procured 1
me 1
great 1
esteem 1
and 1
admiration 1
at 1
the 1
university 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
arrived 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
and 1
had 1
become 1
as 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
theory 1
and 1
practice 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
as 1
depended 1
on 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
professors 1
at 1
ingolstadt 1
my 1
residence 1
there 1
being 1
no 1
longer 1
conducive 1
to 1
my 1
improvements 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
returning 1
to 1
my 1
friends 1
and 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
when 1
an 1
incident 1
happened 1
that 1
protracted 1
my 1
stay 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
phenomena 1
which 1
had 1
peculiarly 1
attracted 1
my 1
attention 1
was 1
the 1
structure 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
and 1
indeed 1
any 1
animal 1
endued 1
with 1
life 1
whence 1
i 1
often 1
asked 1
myself 1
did 1
the 1
principle 1
of 1
life 1
proceed 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
bold 1
question 1
and 1
one 1
which 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
considered 1
as 1
a 1
mystery 1
yet 1
with 1
how 1
many 1
things 1
are 1
we 1
upon 1
the 1
brink 1
of 1
becoming 1
acquainted 1
if 1
cowardice 1
or 1
carelessness 1
did 1
not 1
restrain 1
our 1
inquiries 1
i 1
revolved 1
these 1
circumstances 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
determined 1
thenceforth 1
to 1
apply 1
myself 1
more 1
particularly 1
to 1
those 1
branches 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
which 1
relate 1
to 1
physiology 1
unless 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
animated 1
by 1
an 1
almost 1
supernatural 1
enthusiasm 1
my 1
application 1
to 1
this 1
study 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
irksome 1
and 1
almost 1
intolerable 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
life 1
we 1
must 1
first 1
have 1
recourse 1
to 1
death 1
i 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
anatomy 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
sufficient 1
i 1
must 1
also 1
observe 1
the 1
natural 1
decay 1
and 1
corruption 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
body 1
in 1
my 1
education 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
greatest 1
precautions 1
that 1
my 1
mind 1
should 1
be 1
impressed 1
with 1
no 1
supernatural 1
horrors 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
ever 1
remember 1
to 1
have 1
trembled 1
at 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
superstition 1
or 1
to 1
have 1
feared 1
the 1
apparition 1
of 1
a 1
spirit 1
darkness 1
had 1
no 1
effect 1
upon 1
my 1
fancy 1
and 1
a 1
churchyard 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
merely 1
the 1
receptacle 1
of 1
bodies 1
deprived 1
of 1
life 1
which 1
from 1
being 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
beauty 1
and 1
strength 1
had 1
become 1
food 1
for 1
the 1
worm 1
now 1
i 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
progress 1
of 1
this 1
decay 1
and 1
forced 1
to 1
spend 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
in 1
vaults 1
and 1
charnel 1
houses 1
my 1
attention 1
was 1
fixed 1
upon 1
every 1
object 1
the 1
most 1
insupportable 1
to 1
the 1
delicacy 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
feelings 1
i 1
saw 1
how 1
the 1
fine 1
form 1
of 1
man 1
was 1
degraded 1
and 1
wasted 1
i 1
beheld 1
the 1
corruption 1
of 1
death 1
succeed 1
to 1
the 1
blooming 1
cheek 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
saw 1
how 1
the 1
worm 1
inherited 1
the 1
wonders 1
of 1
the 1
eye 1
and 1
brain 1
i 1
paused 1
examining 1
and 1
analysing 1
all 1
the 1
minutiae 1
of 1
causation 1
as 1
exemplified 1
in 1
the 1
change 1
from 1
life 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
death 1
to 1
life 1
until 1
from 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
this 1
darkness 1
a 1
sudden 1
light 1
broke 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
a 1
light 1
so 1
brilliant 1
and 1
wondrous 1
yet 1
so 1
simple 1
that 1
while 1
i 1
became 1
dizzy 1
with 1
the 1
immensity 1
of 1
the 1
prospect 1
which 1
it 1
illustrated 1
i 1
was 1
surprised 1
that 1
among 1
so 1
many 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
who 1
had 1
directed 1
their 1
inquiries 1
towards 1
the 1
same 1
science 1
that 1
i 1
alone 1
should 1
be 1
reserved 1
to 1
discover 1
so 1
astonishing 1
a 1
secret 1
remember 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
recording 1
the 1
vision 1
of 1
a 1
madman 1
the 1
sun 1
does 1
not 1
more 1
certainly 1
shine 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
i 1
now 1
affirm 1
is 1
true 1
some 1
miracle 1
might 1
have 1
produced 1
it 1
yet 1
the 1
stages 1
of 1
the 1
discovery 1
were 1
distinct 1
and 1
probable 1
after 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
of 1
incredible 1
labour 1
and 1
fatigue 1
i 1
succeeded 1
in 1
discovering 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
generation 1
and 1
life 1
nay 1
more 1
i 1
became 1
myself 1
capable 1
of 1
bestowing 1
animation 1
upon 1
lifeless 1
matter 1
the 1
astonishment 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
experienced 1
on 1
this 1
discovery 1
soon 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
delight 1
and 1
rapture 1
after 1
so 1
much 1
time 1
spent 1
in 1
painful 1
labour 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
once 1
at 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
my 1
desires 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
gratifying 1
consummation 1
of 1
my 1
toils 1
but 1
this 1
discovery 1
was 1
so 1
great 1
and 1
overwhelming 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
steps 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
progressively 1
led 1
to 1
it 1
were 1
obliterated 1
and 1
i 1
beheld 1
only 1
the 1
result 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
study 1
and 1
desire 1
of 1
the 1
wisest 1
men 1
since 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
now 1
within 1
my 1
grasp 1
not 1
that 1
like 1
a 1
magic 1
scene 1
it 1
all 1
opened 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
information 1
i 1
had 1
obtained 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
nature 1
rather 1
to 1
direct 1
my 1
endeavours 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
point 1
them 1
towards 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
search 1
than 1
to 1
exhibit 1
that 1
object 1
already 1
accomplished 1
i 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
arabian 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
buried 1
with 1
the 1
dead 1
and 1
found 1
a 1
passage 1
to 1
life 1
aided 1
only 1
by 1
one 1
glimmering 1
and 1
seemingly 1
ineffectual 1
light 1
i 1
see 1
by 1
your 1
eagerness 1
and 1
the 1
wonder 1
and 1
hope 1
which 1
your 1
eyes 1
express 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
you 1
expect 1
to 1
be 1
informed 1
of 1
the 1
secret 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
acquainted 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
listen 1
patiently 1
until 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
easily 1
perceive 1
why 1
i 1
am 1
reserved 1
upon 1
that 1
subject 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
lead 1
you 1
on 1
unguarded 1
and 1
ardent 1
as 1
i 1
then 1
was 1
to 1
your 1
destruction 1
and 1
infallible 1
misery 1
learn 1
from 1
me 1
if 1
not 1
by 1
my 1
precepts 1
at 1
least 1
by 1
my 1
example 1
how 1
dangerous 1
is 1
the 1
acquirement 1
of 1
knowledge 1
and 1
how 1
much 1
happier 1
that 1
man 1
is 1
who 1
believes 1
his 1
native 1
town 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
world 1
than 1
he 1
who 1
aspires 1
to 1
become 1
greater 1
than 1
his 1
nature 1
will 1
allow 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
so 1
astonishing 1
a 1
power 1
placed 1
within 1
my 1
hands 1
i 1
hesitated 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
concerning 1
the 1
manner 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
employ 1
it 1
although 1
i 1
possessed 1
the 1
capacity 1
of 1
bestowing 1
animation 1
yet 1
to 1
prepare 1
a 1
frame 1
for 1
the 1
reception 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
intricacies 1
of 1
fibres 1
muscles 1
and 1
veins 1
still 1
remained 1
a 1
work 1
of 1
inconceivable 1
difficulty 1
and 1
labour 1
i 1
doubted 1
at 1
first 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
attempt 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
being 1
like 1
myself 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
simpler 1
organization 1
but 1
my 1
imagination 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
exalted 1
by 1
my 1
first 1
success 1
to 1
permit 1
me 1
to 1
doubt 1
of 1
my 1
ability 1
to 1
give 1
life 1
to 1
an 1
animal 1
as 1
complex 1
and 1
wonderful 1
as 1
man 1
the 1
materials 1
at 1
present 1
within 1
my 1
command 1
hardly 1
appeared 1
adequate 1
to 1
so 1
arduous 1
an 1
undertaking 1
but 1
i 1
doubted 1
not 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
ultimately 1
succeed 1
i 1
prepared 1
myself 1
for 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
reverses 1
my 1
operations 1
might 1
be 1
incessantly 1
baffled 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
my 1
work 1
be 1
imperfect 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
considered 1
the 1
improvement 1
which 1
every 1
day 1
takes 1
place 1
in 1
science 1
and 1
mechanics 1
i 1
was 1
encouraged 1
to 1
hope 1
my 1
present 1
attempts 1
would 1
at 1
least 1
lay 1
the 1
foundations 1
of 1
future 1
success 1
nor 1
could 1
i 1
consider 1
the 1
magnitude 1
and 1
complexity 1
of 1
my 1
plan 1
as 1
any 1
argument 1
of 1
its 1
impracticability 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
these 1
feelings 1
that 1
i 1
began 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
as 1
the 1
minuteness 1
of 1
the 1
parts 1
formed 1
a 1
great 1
hindrance 1
to 1
my 1
speed 1
i 1
resolved 1
contrary 1
to 1
my 1
first 1
intention 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
being 1
of 1
a 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
eight 1
feet 1
in 1
height 1
and 1
proportionably 1
large 1
after 1
having 1
formed 1
this 1
determination 1
and 1
having 1
spent 1
some 1
months 1
in 1
successfully 1
collecting 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
materials 1
i 1
began 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
conceive 1
the 1
variety 1
of 1
feelings 1
which 1
bore 1
me 1
onwards 1
like 1
a 1
hurricane 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
success 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
ideal 1
bounds 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
first 1
break 1
through 1
and 1
pour 1
a 1
torrent 1
of 1
light 1
into 1
our 1
dark 1
world 1
a 1
new 1
species 1
would 1
bless 1
me 1
as 1
its 1
creator 1
and 1
source 1
many 1
happy 1
and 1
excellent 1
natures 1
would 1
owe 1
their 1
being 1
to 1
me 1
no 1
father 1
could 1
claim 1
the 1
gratitude 1
of 1
his 1
child 1
so 1
completely 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
deserve 1
theirs 1
pursuing 1
these 1
reflections 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
bestow 1
animation 1
upon 1
lifeless 1
matter 1
i 1
might 1
in 1
process 1
of 1
time 1
although 1
i 1
now 1
found 1
it 1
impossible 1
renew 1
life 1
where 1
death 1
had 1
apparently 1
devoted 1
the 1
body 1
to 1
corruption 1
these 1
thoughts 1
supported 1
my 1
spirits 1
while 1
i 1
pursued 1
my 1
undertaking 1
with 1
unremitting 1
ardour 1
my 1
cheek 1
had 1
grown 1
pale 1
with 1
study 1
and 1
my 1
person 1
had 1
become 1
emaciated 1
with 1
confinement 1
sometimes 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
brink 1
of 1
certainty 1
i 1
failed 1
yet 1
still 1
i 1
clung 1
to 1
the 1
hope 1
which 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
or 1
the 1
next 1
hour 1
might 1
realize 1
one 1
secret 1
which 1
i 1
alone 1
possessed 1
was 1
the 1
hope 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
dedicated 1
myself 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
gazed 1
on 1
my 1
midnight 1
labours 1
while 1
with 1
unrelaxed 1
and 1
breathless 1
eagerness 1
i 1
pursued 1
nature 1
to 1
her 1
hiding 1
places 1
who 1
shall 1
conceive 1
the 1
horrors 1
of 1
my 1
secret 1
toil 1
as 1
i 1
dabbled 1
among 1
the 1
unhallowed 1
damps 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
or 1
tortured 1
the 1
living 1
animal 1
to 1
animate 1
the 1
lifeless 1
clay 1
my 1
limbs 1
now 1
tremble 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
swim 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
but 1
then 1
a 1
resistless 1
and 1
almost 1
frantic 1
impulse 1
urged 1
me 1
forward 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
lost 1
all 1
soul 1
or 1
sensation 1
but 1
for 1
this 1
one 1
pursuit 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
but 1
a 1
passing 1
trance 1
that 1
only 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
with 1
renewed 1
acuteness 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
unnatural 1
stimulus 1
ceasing 1
to 1
operate 1
i 1
had 1
returned 1
to 1
my 1
old 1
habits 1
i 1
collected 1
bones 1
from 1
charnel 1
houses 1
and 1
disturbed 1
with 1
profane 1
fingers 1
the 1
tremendous 1
secrets 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
in 1
a 1
solitary 1
chamber 1
or 1
rather 1
cell 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
separated 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
apartments 1
by 1
a 1
gallery 1
and 1
staircase 1
i 1
kept 1
my 1
workshop 1
of 1
filthy 1
creation 1
my 1
eyeballs 1
were 1
starting 1
from 1
their 1
sockets 1
in 1
attending 1
to 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
my 1
employment 1
the 1
dissecting 1
room 1
and 1
the 1
slaughter 1
house 1
furnished 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
materials 1
and 1
often 1
did 1
my 1
human 1
nature 1
turn 1
with 1
loathing 1
from 1
my 1
occupation 1
whilst 1
still 1
urged 1
on 1
by 1
an 1
eagerness 1
which 1
perpetually 1
increased 1
i 1
brought 1
my 1
work 1
near 1
to 1
a 1
conclusion 1
the 1
summer 1
months 1
passed 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
thus 1
engaged 1
heart 1
and 1
soul 1
in 1
one 1
pursuit 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
beautiful 1
season 1
never 1
did 1
the 1
fields 1
bestow 1
a 1
more 1
plentiful 1
harvest 1
or 1
the 1
vines 1
yield 1
a 1
more 1
luxuriant 1
vintage 1
but 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
insensible 1
to 1
the 1
charms 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
feelings 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
neglect 1
the 1
scenes 1
around 1
me 1
caused 1
me 1
also 1
to 1
forget 1
those 1
friends 1
who 1
were 1
so 1
many 1
miles 1
absent 1
and 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
time 1
i 1
knew 1
my 1
silence 1
disquieted 1
them 1
and 1
i 1
well 1
remembered 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
while 1
you 1
are 1
pleased 1
with 1
yourself 1
you 1
will 1
think 1
of 1
us 1
with 1
affection 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
hear 1
regularly 1
from 1
you 1
you 1
must 1
pardon 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
regard 1
any 1
interruption 1
in 1
your 1
correspondence 1
as 1
a 1
proof 1
that 1
your 1
other 1
duties 1
are 1
equally 1
neglected 1
i 1
knew 1
well 1
therefore 1
what 1
would 1
be 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
feelings 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
tear 1
my 1
thoughts 1
from 1
my 1
employment 1
loathsome 1
in 1
itself 1
but 1
which 1
had 1
taken 1
an 1
irresistible 1
hold 1
of 1
my 1
imagination 1
i 1
wished 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
procrastinate 1
all 1
that 1
related 1
to 1
my 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
until 1
the 1
great 1
object 1
which 1
swallowed 1
up 1
every 1
habit 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
should 1
be 1
completed 1
i 1
then 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
would 1
be 1
unjust 1
if 1
he 1
ascribed 1
my 1
neglect 1
to 1
vice 1
or 1
faultiness 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
convinced 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
justified 1
in 1
conceiving 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
altogether 1
free 1
from 1
blame 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
in 1
perfection 1
ought 1
always 1
to 1
preserve 1
a 1
calm 1
and 1
peaceful 1
mind 1
and 1
never 1
to 1
allow 1
passion 1
or 1
a 1
transitory 1
desire 1
to 1
disturb 1
his 1
tranquillity 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
knowledge 1
is 1
an 1
exception 1
to 1
this 1
rule 1
if 1
the 1
study 1
to 1
which 1
you 1
apply 1
yourself 1
has 1
a 1
tendency 1
to 1
weaken 1
your 1
affections 1
and 1
to 1

those 1
simple 1
pleasures 1
in 1
which 1
no 1
alloy 1
can 1
possibly 1
mix 1
then 1
that 1

certainly 1
unlawful 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
not 1
befitting 1
the 1

mind 1
if 1
this 1
rule 1
were 1

allowed 1
any 1

but 1
i 1
forget 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
moralizing 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
tale 1

my 1
father 1
made 1
no 1
reproach 1
in 1
his 1
letters 1
and 1
only 1
took 1
notice 1
of 1
my 1
silence 1
by 1
inquiring 1
into 1
my 1
occupations 1
more 1
particularly 1
than 1
before 1
winter 1
spring 1
and 1
summer 1
passed 1
away 1
during 1
my 1
labours 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
watch 1
the 1
blossom 1
or 1
the 1
expanding 1
leaves 1
sights 1
which 1
before 1
always 1
yielded 1
me 1
supreme 1
delight 1
so 1
deeply 1
was 1
i 1
engrossed 1
in 1
my 1
occupation 1
the 1
leaves 1
of 1
that 1
year 1
had 1
withered 1
before 1
my 1
work 1
drew 1
near 1
to 1
a 1
close 1
and 1
now 1
every 1
day 1
showed 1
me 1
more 1
plainly 1
how 1
well 1
i 1
had 1
succeeded 1
but 1
my 1
enthusiasm 1
was 1
checked 1
by 1
my 1
anxiety 1
and 1
i 1
appeared 1
rather 1
like 1
one 1
doomed 1
by 1
slavery 1
to 1
toil 1
in 1
the 1
mines 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
unwholesome 1
trade 1
than 1
an 1
artist 1
occupied 1
by 1
his 1
favourite 1
employment 1
every 1
night 1
i 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
a 1
slow 1
fever 1
and 1
i 1
became 1
nervous 1
to 1
a 1
most 1
painful 1
degree 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
a 1
leaf 1
startled 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
shunned 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
guilty 1
of 1
a 1
crime 1
sometimes 1
i 1
grew 1
alarmed 1
at 1
the 1
wreck 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
become 1
the 1
energy 1
of 1
my 1
purpose 1
alone 1
sustained 1
me 1
my 1
labours 1
would 1
soon 1
end 1
and 1
i 1
believed 1
that 1
exercise 1
and 1
amusement 1
would 1
then 1
drive 1
away 1
incipient 1
disease 1
and 1
i 1
promised 1
myself 1
both 1
of 1
these 1
when 1
my 1
creation 1
should 1
be 1
complete 1
chapter 1
5 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
dreary 1
night 1
of 1
november 1
that 1
i 1
beheld 1
the 1
accomplishment 1
of 1
my 1
toils 1
with 1
an 1
anxiety 1
that 1
almost 1
amounted 1
to 1
agony 1
i 1
collected 1
the 1
instruments 1
of 1
life 1
around 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
infuse 1
a 1
spark 1
of 1
being 1
into 1
the 1
lifeless 1
thing 1
that 1
lay 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
rain 1
pattered 1
dismally 1
against 1
the 1
panes 1
and 1
my 1
candle 1
was 1
nearly 1
burnt 1
out 1
when 1
by 1
the 1
glimmer 1
of 1
the 1
half 1
extinguished 1
light 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
dull 1
yellow 1
eye 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
open 1
it 1
breathed 1
hard 1
and 1
a 1
convulsive 1
motion 1
agitated 1
its 1
limbs 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
describe 1
my 1
emotions 1
at 1
this 1
catastrophe 1
or 1
how 1
delineate 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
with 1
such 1
infinite 1
pains 1
and 1
care 1
i 1
had 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
form 1
his 1
limbs 1
were 1
in 1
proportion 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
selected 1
his 1
features 1
as 1
beautiful 1
beautiful 1
great 1
god 1
his 1
yellow 1
skin 1
scarcely 1
covered 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
muscles 1
and 1
arteries 1
beneath 1
his 1
hair 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
lustrous 1
black 1
and 1
flowing 1
his 1
teeth 1
of 1
a 1
pearly 1
whiteness 1
but 1
these 1
luxuriances 1
only 1
formed 1
a 1
more 1
horrid 1
contrast 1
with 1
his 1
watery 1
eyes 1
that 1
seemed 1
almost 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
colour 1
as 1
the 1
dun 1
white 1
sockets 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
set 1
his 1
shrivelled 1
complexion 1
and 1
straight 1
black 1
lips 1
the 1
different 1
accidents 1
of 1
life 1
are 1
not 1
so 1
changeable 1
as 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
human 1
nature 1
i 1
had 1
worked 1
hard 1
for 1
nearly 1
two 1
years 1
for 1
the 1
sole 1
purpose 1
of 1
infusing 1
life 1
into 1
an 1
inanimate 1
body 1
for 1
this 1
i 1
had 1
deprived 1
myself 1
of 1
rest 1
and 1
health 1
i 1
had 1
desired 1
it 1
with 1
an 1
ardour 1
that 1
far 1
exceeded 1
moderation 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
finished 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
dream 1
vanished 1
and 1
breathless 1
horror 1
and 1
disgust 1
filled 1
my 1
heart 1
unable 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
being 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
i 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
continued 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
traversing 1
my 1
bed 1
chamber 1
unable 1
to 1
compose 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
sleep 1
at 1
length 1
lassitude 1
succeeded 1
to 1
the 1
tumult 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
endured 1
and 1
i 1
threw 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
bed 1
in 1
my 1
clothes 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
seek 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
of 1
forgetfulness 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
i 1
slept 1
indeed 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
wildest 1
dreams 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
saw 1
elizabeth 1
in 1
the 1
bloom 1
of 1
health 1
walking 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
of 1
ingolstadt 1
delighted 1
and 1
surprised 1
i 1
embraced 1
her 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
imprinted 1
the 1
first 1
kiss 1
on 1
her 1
lips 1
they 1
became 1
livid 1
with 1
the 1
hue 1
of 1
death 1
her 1
features 1
appeared 1
to 1
change 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
held 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
dead 1
mother 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
a 1
shroud 1
enveloped 1
her 1
form 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
grave 1
worms 1
crawling 1
in 1
the 1
folds 1
of 1
the 1
flannel 1
i 1
started 1
from 1
my 1
sleep 1
with 1
horror 1
a 1
cold 1
dew 1
covered 1
my 1
forehead 1
my 1
teeth 1
chattered 1
and 1
every 1
limb 1
became 1
convulsed 1
when 1
by 1
the 1
dim 1
and 1
yellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
as 1
it 1
forced 1
its 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
shutters 1
i 1
beheld 1
the 1
wretch 1
the 1
miserable 1
monster 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
he 1
held 1
up 1
the 1
curtain 1
of 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
if 1
eyes 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
called 1
were 1
fixed 1
on 1
me 1
his 1
jaws 1
opened 1
and 1
he 1
muttered 1
some 1
inarticulate 1
sounds 1
while 1
a 1
grin 1
wrinkled 1
his 1
cheeks 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
spoken 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
one 1
hand 1
was 1
stretched 1
out 1
seemingly 1
to 1
detain 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
escaped 1
and 1
rushed 1
downstairs 1
i 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
courtyard 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
i 1
inhabited 1
where 1
i 1
remained 1
during 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
agitation 1
listening 1
attentively 1
catching 1
and 1
fearing 1
each 1
sound 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
announce 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
the 1
demoniacal 1
corpse 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
miserably 1
given 1
life 1
oh 1
no 1
mortal 1
could 1
support 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
that 1
countenance 1
a 1
mummy 1
again 1
endued 1
with 1
animation 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
hideous 1
as 1
that 1
wretch 1
i 1
had 1
gazed 1
on 1
him 1
while 1
unfinished 1
he 1
was 1
ugly 1
then 1
but 1
when 1
those 1
muscles 1
and 1
joints 1
were 1
rendered 1
capable 1
of 1
motion 1
it 1
became 1
a 1
thing 1
such 1
as 1
even 1
dante 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
conceived 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
night 1
wretchedly 1
sometimes 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
so 1
quickly 1
and 1
hardly 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
palpitation 1
of 1
every 1
artery 1
at 1
others 1
i 1
nearly 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
through 1
languor 1
and 1
extreme 1
weakness 1
mingled 1
with 1
this 1
horror 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
bitterness 1
of 1
disappointment 1
dreams 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
food 1
and 1
pleasant 1
rest 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
space 1
were 1
now 1
become 1
a 1
hell 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
change 1
was 1
so 1
rapid 1
the 1
overthrow 1
so 1
complete 1
morning 1
dismal 1
and 1
wet 1
at 1
length 1
dawned 1
and 1
discovered 1
to 1
my 1
sleepless 1
and 1
aching 1
eyes 1
the 1
church 1
of 1
ingolstadt 1
its 1
white 1
steeple 1
and 1
clock 1
which 1
indicated 1
the 1
sixth 1
hour 1
the 1
porter 1
opened 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
which 1
had 1
that 1
night 1
been 1
my 1
asylum 1
and 1
i 1
issued 1
into 1
the 1
streets 1
pacing 1
them 1
with 1
quick 1
steps 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
sought 1
to 1
avoid 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
i 1
feared 1
every 1
turning 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
would 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
view 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
dare 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
apartment 1
which 1
i 1
inhabited 1
but 1
felt 1
impelled 1
to 1
hurry 1
on 1
although 1
drenched 1
by 1
the 1
rain 1
which 1
poured 1
from 1
a 1
black 1
and 1
comfortless 1
sky 1
i 1
continued 1
walking 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
endeavouring 1
by 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
to 1
ease 1
the 1
load 1
that 1
weighed 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
traversed 1
the 1
streets 1
without 1
any 1
clear 1
conception 1
of 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
or 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
doing 1
my 1
heart 1
palpitated 1
in 1
the 1
sickness 1
of 1
fear 1
and 1
i 1
hurried 1
on 1
with 1
irregular 1
steps 1
not 1
daring 1
to 1
look 1
about 1
me 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
on 1
a 1
lonely 1
road 1
doth 1
walk 1
in 1
fear 1
and 1
dread 1
and 1
having 1
once 1
turned 1
round 1
walks 1
on 1
and 1
turns 1
no 1
more 1
his 1
head 1
because 1
he 1
knows 1
a 1
frightful 1
fiend 1
doth 1
close 1
behind 1
him 1
tread 1
coleridge 1
s 1
ancient 1
mariner 1
continuing 1
thus 1
i 1
came 1
at 1
length 1
opposite 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
various 1
diligences 1
and 1
carriages 1
usually 1
stopped 1
here 1
i 1
paused 1
i 1
knew 1
not 1
why 1
but 1
i 1
remained 1
some 1
minutes 1
with 1
my 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
a 1
coach 1
that 1
was 1
coming 1
towards 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
as 1
it 1
drew 1
nearer 1
i 1
observed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
swiss 1
diligence 1
it 1
stopped 1
just 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
standing 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
being 1
opened 1
i 1
perceived 1
henry 1
clerval 1
who 1
on 1
seeing 1
me 1
instantly 1
sprung 1
out 1
my 1
dear 1
frankenstein 1
exclaimed 1
he 1
how 1
glad 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
how 1
fortunate 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
here 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
moment 1
of 1
my 1
alighting 1
nothing 1
could 1
equal 1
my 1
delight 1
on 1
seeing 1
clerval 1
his 1
presence 1
brought 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
thoughts 1
my 1
father 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
scenes 1
of 1
home 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
i 1
grasped 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
forgot 1
my 1
horror 1
and 1
misfortune 1
i 1
felt 1
suddenly 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
during 1
many 1
months 1
calm 1
and 1
serene 1
joy 1
i 1
welcomed 1
my 1
friend 1
therefore 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
cordial 1
manner 1
and 1
we 1
walked 1
towards 1
my 1
college 1
clerval 1
continued 1
talking 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
about 1
our 1
mutual 1
friends 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
good 1
fortune 1
in 1
being 1
permitted 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
ingolstadt 1
you 1
may 1
easily 1
believe 1
said 1
he 1
how 1
great 1
was 1
the 1
difficulty 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
all 1
necessary 1
knowledge 1
was 1
not 1
comprised 1
in 1
the 1
noble 1
art 1
of 1
book 1
keeping 1
and 1
indeed 1
i 1
believe 1
i 1
left 1
him 1
incredulous 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
for 1
his 1
constant 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
unwearied 1
entreaties 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
dutch 1
schoolmaster 1
in 1
the 1
vicar 1
of 1
wakefield 1
i 1
have 1
ten 1
thousand 1
florins 1
a 1
year 1
without 1
greek 1
i 1
eat 1
heartily 1
without 1
greek 1
but 1
his 1
affection 1
for 1
me 1
at 1
length 1
overcame 1
his 1
dislike 1
of 1
learning 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
permitted 1
me 1
to 1
undertake 1
a 1
voyage 1
of 1
discovery 1
to 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
knowledge 1
it 1
gives 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
delight 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
how 1
you 1
left 1
my 1
father 1
brothers 1
and 1
elizabeth 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
very 1
happy 1
only 1
a 1
little 1
uneasy 1
that 1
they 1
hear 1
from 1
you 1
so 1
seldom 1
by 1
the 1
by 1
i 1
mean 1
to 1
lecture 1
you 1
a 1
little 1
upon 1
their 1
account 1
myself 1
but 1
my 1
dear 1
frankenstein 1
continued 1
he 1
stopping 1
short 1
and 1
gazing 1
full 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
before 1
remark 1
how 1
very 1
ill 1
you 1
appear 1
so 1
thin 1
and 1
pale 1
you 1
look 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
watching 1
for 1
several 1
nights 1
you 1
have 1
guessed 1
right 1
i 1
have 1
lately 1
been 1
so 1
deeply 1
engaged 1
in 1
one 1
occupation 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
allowed 1
myself 1
sufficient 1
rest 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
but 1
i 1
hope 1
i 1
sincerely 1
hope 1
that 1
all 1
these 1
employments 1
are 1
now 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
at 1
length 1
free 1
i 1
trembled 1
excessively 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
and 1
far 1
less 1
to 1
allude 1
to 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
i 1
walked 1
with 1
a 1
quick 1
pace 1
and 1
we 1
soon 1
arrived 1
at 1
my 1
college 1
i 1
then 1
reflected 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
made 1
me 1
shiver 1
that 1
the 1
creature 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
in 1
my 1
apartment 1
might 1
still 1
be 1
there 1
alive 1
and 1
walking 1
about 1
i 1
dreaded 1
to 1
behold 1
this 1
monster 1
but 1
i 1
feared 1
still 1
more 1
that 1
henry 1
should 1
see 1
him 1
entreating 1
him 1
therefore 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
i 1
darted 1
up 1
towards 1
my 1
own 1
room 1
my 1
hand 1
was 1
already 1
on 1
the 1
lock 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
before 1
i 1
recollected 1
myself 1
i 1
then 1
paused 1
and 1
a 1
cold 1
shivering 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
i 1
threw 1
the 1
door 1
forcibly 1
open 1
as 1
children 1
are 1
accustomed 1
to 1
do 1
when 1
they 1
expect 1
a 1
spectre 1
to 1
stand 1
in 1
waiting 1
for 1
them 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
but 1
nothing 1
appeared 1
i 1
stepped 1
fearfully 1
in 1
the 1
apartment 1
was 1
empty 1
and 1
my 1
bedroom 1
was 1
also 1
freed 1
from 1
its 1
hideous 1
guest 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
believe 1
that 1
so 1
great 1
a 1
good 1
fortune 1
could 1
have 1
befallen 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
became 1
assured 1
that 1
my 1
enemy 1
had 1
indeed 1
fled 1
i 1
clapped 1
my 1
hands 1
for 1
joy 1
and 1
ran 1
down 1
to 1
clerval 1
we 1
ascended 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
the 1
servant 1
presently 1
brought 1
breakfast 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
contain 1
myself 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
joy 1
only 1
that 1
possessed 1
me 1
i 1
felt 1
my 1
flesh 1
tingle 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
sensitiveness 1
and 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
rapidly 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
remain 1
for 1
a 1
single 1
instant 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
i 1
jumped 1
over 1
the 1
chairs 1
clapped 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
laughed 1
aloud 1
clerval 1
at 1
first 1
attributed 1
my 1
unusual 1
spirits 1
to 1
joy 1
on 1
his 1
arrival 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
observed 1
me 1
more 1
attentively 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
wildness 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
account 1
and 1
my 1
loud 1
unrestrained 1
heartless 1
laughter 1
frightened 1
and 1
astonished 1
him 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
cried 1
he 1
what 1
for 1
god 1
s 1
sake 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
do 1
not 1
laugh 1
in 1
that 1
manner 1
how 1
ill 1
you 1
are 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
do 1
not 1
ask 1
me 1
cried 1
i 1
putting 1
my 1
hands 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
for 1
i 1
thought 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
dreaded 1
spectre 1
glide 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
can 1
tell 1
oh 1
save 1
me 1
save 1
me 1
i 1
imagined 1
that 1
the 1
monster 1
seized 1
me 1
i 1
struggled 1
furiously 1
and 1
fell 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
fit 1
poor 1
clerval 1
what 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
feelings 1
a 1
meeting 1
which 1
he 1
anticipated 1
with 1
such 1
joy 1
so 1
strangely 1
turned 1
to 1
bitterness 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
witness 1
of 1
his 1
grief 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
lifeless 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
recover 1
my 1
senses 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
long 1
time 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
a 1
nervous 1
fever 1
which 1
confined 1
me 1
for 1
several 1
months 1
during 1
all 1
that 1
time 1
henry 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
nurse 1
i 1
afterwards 1
learned 1
that 1
knowing 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
advanced 1
age 1
and 1
unfitness 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
journey 1
and 1
how 1
wretched 1
my 1
sickness 1
would 1
make 1
elizabeth 1
he 1
spared 1
them 1
this 1
grief 1
by 1
concealing 1
the 1
extent 1
of 1
my 1
disorder 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
more 1
kind 1
and 1
attentive 1
nurse 1
than 1
himself 1
and 1
firm 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
he 1
felt 1
of 1
my 1
recovery 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
instead 1
of 1
doing 1
harm 1
he 1
performed 1
the 1
kindest 1
action 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
towards 1
them 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
reality 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
surely 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
unbounded 1
and 1
unremitting 1
attentions 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
could 1
have 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
on 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
bestowed 1
existence 1
was 1
forever 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
i 1
raved 1
incessantly 1
concerning 1
him 1
doubtless 1
my 1
words 1
surprised 1
henry 1
he 1
at 1
first 1
believed 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
wanderings 1
of 1
my 1
disturbed 1
imagination 1
but 1
the 1
pertinacity 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
continually 1
recurred 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
subject 1
persuaded 1
him 1
that 1
my 1
disorder 1
indeed 1
owed 1
its 1
origin 1
to 1
some 1
uncommon 1
and 1
terrible 1
event 1
by 1
very 1
slow 1
degrees 1
and 1
with 1
frequent 1
relapses 1
that 1
alarmed 1
and 1
grieved 1
my 1
friend 1
i 1
recovered 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
i 1
became 1
capable 1
of 1
observing 1
outward 1
objects 1
with 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
pleasure 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
fallen 1
leaves 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
buds 1
were 1
shooting 1
forth 1
from 1
the 1
trees 1
that 1
shaded 1
my 1
window 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
divine 1
spring 1
and 1
the 1
season 1
contributed 1
greatly 1
to 1
my 1
convalescence 1
i 1
felt 1
also 1
sentiments 1
of 1
joy 1
and 1
affection 1
revive 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
my 1
gloom 1
disappeared 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
i 1
became 1
as 1
cheerful 1
as 1
before 1
i 1
was 1
attacked 1
by 1
the 1
fatal 1
passion 1
dearest 1
clerval 1
exclaimed 1
i 1
how 1
kind 1
how 1
very 1
good 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
me 1
this 1
whole 1
winter 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
spent 1
in 1
study 1
as 1
you 1
promised 1
yourself 1
has 1
been 1
consumed 1
in 1
my 1
sick 1
room 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
ever 1
repay 1
you 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
greatest 1
remorse 1
for 1
the 1
disappointment 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
occasion 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
forgive 1
me 1
you 1
will 1
repay 1
me 1
entirely 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
discompose 1
yourself 1
but 1
get 1
well 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
since 1
you 1
appear 1
in 1
such 1
good 1
spirits 1
i 1
may 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
on 1
one 1
subject 1
may 1
i 1
not 1
i 1
trembled 1
one 1
subject 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
could 1
he 1
allude 1
to 1
an 1
object 1
on 1
whom 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
even 1
think 1
compose 1
yourself 1
said 1
clerval 1
who 1
observed 1
my 1
change 1
of 1
colour 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
mention 1
it 1
if 1
it 1
agitates 1
you 1
but 1
your 1
father 1
and 1
cousin 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
happy 1
if 1
they 1
received 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
handwriting 1
they 1
hardly 1
know 1
how 1
ill 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
and 1
are 1
uneasy 1
at 1
your 1
long 1
silence 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
my 1
dear 1
henry 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
suppose 1
that 1
my 1
first 1
thought 1
would 1
not 1
fly 1
towards 1
those 1
dear 1
dear 1
friends 1
whom 1
i 1
love 1
and 1
who 1
are 1
so 1
deserving 1
of 1
my 1
love 1
if 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
present 1
temper 1
my 1
friend 1
you 1
will 1
perhaps 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
letter 1
that 1
has 1
been 1
lying 1
here 1
some 1
days 1
for 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
from 1
your 1
cousin 1
i 1
believe 1
chapter 1
6 1
clerval 1
then 1
put 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
it 1
was 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
dearest 1
cousin 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
ill 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
even 1
the 1
constant 1
letters 1
of 1
dear 1
kind 1
henry 1
are 1
not 1
sufficient 1
to 1
reassure 1
me 1
on 1
your 1
account 1
you 1
are 1
forbidden 1
to 1
write 1
to 1
hold 1
a 1
pen 1
yet 1
one 1
word 1
from 1
you 1
dear 1
victor 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
calm 1
our 1
apprehensions 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
have 1
thought 1
that 1
each 1
post 1
would 1
bring 1
this 1
line 1
and 1
my 1
persuasions 1
have 1
restrained 1
my 1
uncle 1
from 1
undertaking 1
a 1
journey 1
to 1
ingolstadt 1
i 1
have 1
prevented 1
his 1
encountering 1
the 1
inconveniences 1
and 1
perhaps 1
dangers 1
of 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
journey 1
yet 1
how 1
often 1
have 1
i 1
regretted 1
not 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
perform 1
it 1
myself 1
i 1
figure 1
to 1
myself 1
that 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
attending 1
on 1
your 1
sickbed 1
has 1
devolved 1
on 1
some 1
mercenary 1
old 1
nurse 1
who 1
could 1
never 1
guess 1
your 1
wishes 1
nor 1
minister 1
to 1
them 1
with 1
the 1
care 1
and 1
affection 1
of 1
your 1
poor 1
cousin 1
yet 1
that 1
is 1
over 1
now 1
clerval 1
writes 1
that 1
indeed 1
you 1
are 1
getting 1
better 1
i 1
eagerly 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
confirm 1
this 1
intelligence 1
soon 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
handwriting 1
get 1
well 1
and 1
return 1
to 1
us 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
happy 1
cheerful 1
home 1
and 1
friends 1
who 1
love 1
you 1
dearly 1
your 1
father 1
s 1
health 1
is 1
vigorous 1
and 1
he 1
asks 1
but 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
well 1
and 1
not 1
a 1
care 1
will 1
ever 1
cloud 1
his 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
how 1
pleased 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
remark 1
the 1
improvement 1
of 1
our 1
ernest 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
sixteen 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
activity 1
and 1
spirit 1
he 1
is 1
desirous 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
true 1
swiss 1
and 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
foreign 1
service 1
but 1
we 1
cannot 1
part 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
least 1
until 1
his 1
elder 1
brother 1
returns 1
to 1
us 1
my 1
uncle 1
is 1
not 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
a 1
military 1
career 1
in 1
a 1
distant 1
country 1
but 1
ernest 1
never 1
had 1
your 1
powers 1
of 1
application 1
he 1
looks 1
upon 1
study 1
as 1
an 1
odious 1
fetter 1
his 1
time 1
is 1
spent 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
climbing 1
the 1
hills 1
or 1
rowing 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
become 1
an 1
idler 1
unless 1
we 1
yield 1
the 1
point 1
and 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
enter 1
on 1
the 1
profession 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
selected 1
little 1
alteration 1
except 1
the 1
growth 1
of 1
our 1
dear 1
children 1
has 1
taken 1
place 1
since 1
you 1
left 1
us 1
the 1
blue 1
lake 1
and 1
snow 1
clad 1
mountains 1
they 1
never 1
change 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
our 1
placid 1
home 1
and 1
our 1
contented 1
hearts 1
are 1
regulated 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
immutable 1
laws 1
my 1
trifling 1
occupations 1
take 1
up 1
my 1
time 1
and 1
amuse 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
rewarded 1
for 1
any 1
exertions 1
by 1
seeing 1
none 1
but 1
happy 1
kind 1
faces 1
around 1
me 1
since 1
you 1
left 1
us 1
but 1
one 1
change 1
has 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
our 1
little 1
household 1
do 1
you 1
remember 1
on 1
what 1
occasion 1
justine 1
moritz 1
entered 1
our 1
family 1
probably 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
i 1
will 1
relate 1
her 1
history 1
therefore 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
madame 1
moritz 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
widow 1
with 1
four 1
children 1
of 1
whom 1
justine 1
was 1
the 1
third 1
this 1
girl 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
but 1
through 1
a 1
strange 1
perversity 1
her 1
mother 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
her 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
m 1
moritz 1
treated 1
her 1
very 1
ill 1
my 1
aunt 1
observed 1
this 1
and 1
when 1
justine 1
was 1
twelve 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
prevailed 1
on 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
allow 1
her 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
our 1
house 1
the 1
republican 1
institutions 1
of 1
our 1
country 1
have 1
produced 1
simpler 1
and 1
happier 1
manners 1
than 1
those 1
which 1
prevail 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
monarchies 1
that 1
surround 1
it 1
hence 1
there 1
is 1
less 1
distinction 1
between 1
the 1
several 1
classes 1
of 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
the 1
lower 1
orders 1
being 1
neither 1
so 1
poor 1
nor 1
so 1
despised 1
their 1
manners 1
are 1
more 1
refined 1
and 1
moral 1
a 1
servant 1
in 1
geneva 1
does 1
not 1
mean 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
servant 1
in 1
france 1
and 1
england 1
justine 1
thus 1
received 1
in 1
our 1
family 1
learned 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
a 1
servant 1
a 1
condition 1
which 1
in 1
our 1
fortunate 1
country 1
does 1
not 1
include 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
ignorance 1
and 1
a 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
justine 1
you 1
may 1
remember 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
favourite 1
of 1
yours 1
and 1
i 1
recollect 1
you 1
once 1
remarked 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
in 1
an 1
ill 1
humour 1
one 1
glance 1
from 1
justine 1
could 1
dissipate 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
same 1
reason 1
that 1
ariosto 1
gives 1
concerning 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
angelica 1
she 1
looked 1
so 1
frank 1
hearted 1
and 1
happy 1
my 1
aunt 1
conceived 1
a 1
great 1
attachment 1
for 1
her 1
by 1
which 1
she 1
was 1
induced 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
an 1
education 1
superior 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
intended 1
this 1
benefit 1
was 1
fully 1
repaid 1
justine 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
grateful 1
little 1
creature 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
mean 1
that 1
she 1
made 1
any 1
professions 1
i 1
never 1
heard 1
one 1
pass 1
her 1
lips 1
but 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
her 1
eyes 1
that 1
she 1
almost 1
adored 1
her 1
protectress 1
although 1
her 1
disposition 1
was 1
gay 1
and 1
in 1
many 1
respects 1
inconsiderate 1
yet 1
she 1
paid 1
the 1
greatest 1
attention 1
to 1
every 1
gesture 1
of 1
my 1
aunt 1
she 1
thought 1
her 1
the 1
model 1
of 1
all 1
excellence 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
imitate 1
her 1
phraseology 1
and 1
manners 1
so 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
she 1
often 1
reminds 1
me 1
of 1
her 1
when 1
my 1
dearest 1
aunt 1
died 1
every 1
one 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
occupied 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
grief 1
to 1
notice 1
poor 1
justine 1
who 1
had 1
attended 1
her 1
during 1
her 1
illness 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
anxious 1
affection 1
poor 1
justine 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
but 1
other 1
trials 1
were 1
reserved 1
for 1
her 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
her 1
brothers 1
and 1
sister 1
died 1
and 1
her 1
mother 1
with 1
the 1
exception 1
of 1
her 1
neglected 1
daughter 1
was 1
left 1
childless 1
the 1
conscience 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
was 1
troubled 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
her 1
favourites 1
was 1
a 1
judgement 1
from 1
heaven 1
to 1
chastise 1
her 1
partiality 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
roman 1
catholic 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
her 1
confessor 1
confirmed 1
the 1
idea 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
conceived 1
accordingly 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
after 1
your 1
departure 1
for 1
ingolstadt 1
justine 1
was 1
called 1
home 1
by 1
her 1
repentant 1
mother 1
poor 1
girl 1
she 1
wept 1
when 1
she 1
quitted 1
our 1
house 1
she 1
was 1
much 1
altered 1
since 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
aunt 1
grief 1
had 1
given 1
softness 1
and 1
a 1
winning 1
mildness 1
to 1
her 1
manners 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
remarkable 1
for 1
vivacity 1
nor 1
was 1
her 1
residence 1
at 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
house 1
of 1
a 1
nature 1
to 1
restore 1
her 1
gaiety 1
the 1
poor 1
woman 1
was 1
very 1
vacillating 1
in 1
her 1
repentance 1
she 1
sometimes 1
begged 1
justine 1
to 1
forgive 1
her 1
unkindness 1
but 1
much 1
oftener 1
accused 1
her 1
of 1
having 1
caused 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
her 1
brothers 1
and 1
sister 1
perpetual 1
fretting 1
at 1
length 1
threw 1
madame 1
moritz 1
into 1
a 1
decline 1
which 1
at 1
first 1
increased 1
her 1
irritability 1
but 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
at 1
peace 1
for 1
ever 1
she 1
died 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
approach 1
of 1
cold 1
weather 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
this 1
last 1
winter 1
justine 1
has 1
just 1
returned 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
i 1
love 1
her 1
tenderly 1
she 1
is 1
very 1
clever 1
and 1
gentle 1
and 1
extremely 1
pretty 1
as 1
i 1
mentioned 1
before 1
her 1
mien 1
and 1
her 1
expression 1

me 1
of 1
my 1
dear 1
aunt 1
i 1
must 1
say 1
also 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
to 1

dear 1

with 1
sweet 1
laughing 1
blue 1
eyes 1
dark 1
eyelashes 1
and 1
curling 1
hair 1
when 1
he 1
smiles 1
two 1
little 1
dimples 1
appear 1
on 1
each 1
cheek 1
which 1
are 1
rosy 1
with 1
health 1

they 1
must 1
feel 1
i 1
wrote 1
and 1
this 1
exertion 1
greatly 1
fatigued 1
me 1
but 1
my 1
convalescence 1
had 1
commenced 1
and 1
proceeded 1
regularly 1
in 1
another 1
fortnight 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
leave 1
my 1
chamber 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
first 1
duties 1
on 1
my 1
recovery 1
was 1
to 1
introduce 1
clerval 1
to 1
the 1
several 1
professors 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
in 1
doing 1
this 1
i 1
underwent 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
rough 1
usage 1
ill 1
befitting 1
the 1
wounds 1
that 1
my 1
mind 1
had 1
sustained 1
ever 1
since 1
the 1
fatal 1
night 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
and 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
i 1
had 1
conceived 1
a 1
violent 1
antipathy 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
natural 1
philosophy 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
otherwise 1
quite 1
restored 1
to 1
health 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
chemical 1
instrument 1
would 1
renew 1
all 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
nervous 1
symptoms 1
henry 1
saw 1
this 1
and 1
had 1
removed 1
all 1
my 1
apparatus 1
from 1
my 1
view 1
he 1
had 1
also 1
changed 1
my 1
apartment 1
for 1
he 1
perceived 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
acquired 1
a 1
dislike 1
for 1
the 1
room 1
which 1
had 1
previously 1
been 1
my 1
laboratory 1
but 1
these 1
cares 1
of 1
clerval 1
were 1
made 1
of 1
no 1
avail 1
when 1
i 1
visited 1
the 1
professors 1
m 1
waldman 1
inflicted 1
torture 1
when 1
he 1
praised 1
with 1
kindness 1
and 1
warmth 1
the 1
astonishing 1
progress 1
i 1
had 1
made 1
in 1
the 1
sciences 1
he 1
soon 1
perceived 1
that 1
i 1
disliked 1
the 1
subject 1
but 1
not 1
guessing 1
the 1
real 1
cause 1
he 1
attributed 1
my 1
feelings 1
to 1
modesty 1
and 1
changed 1
the 1
subject 1
from 1
my 1
improvement 1
to 1
the 1
science 1
itself 1
with 1
a 1
desire 1
as 1
i 1
evidently 1
saw 1
of 1
drawing 1
me 1
out 1
what 1
could 1
i 1
do 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
please 1
and 1
he 1
tormented 1
me 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
placed 1
carefully 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
in 1
my 1
view 1
those 1
instruments 1
which 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
afterwards 1
used 1
in 1
putting 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
slow 1
and 1
cruel 1
death 1
i 1
writhed 1
under 1
his 1
words 1
yet 1
dared 1
not 1
exhibit 1
the 1
pain 1
i 1
felt 1
clerval 1
whose 1
eyes 1
and 1
feelings 1
were 1
always 1
quick 1
in 1
discerning 1
the 1
sensations 1
of 1
others 1
declined 1
the 1
subject 1
alleging 1
in 1
excuse 1
his 1
total 1
ignorance 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
took 1
a 1
more 1
general 1
turn 1
i 1
thanked 1
my 1
friend 1
from 1
my 1
heart 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
speak 1
i 1
saw 1
plainly 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
surprised 1
but 1
he 1
never 1
attempted 1
to 1
draw 1
my 1
secret 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
loved 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
reverence 1
that 1
knew 1
no 1
bounds 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
never 1
persuade 1
myself 1
to 1
confide 1
in 1
him 1
that 1
event 1
which 1
was 1
so 1
often 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
but 1
which 1
i 1
feared 1
the 1
detail 1
to 1
another 1
would 1
only 1
impress 1
more 1
deeply 1
m 1
krempe 1
was 1
not 1
equally 1
docile 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
condition 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
of 1
almost 1
insupportable 1
sensitiveness 1
his 1
harsh 1
blunt 1
encomiums 1
gave 1
me 1
even 1
more 1
pain 1
than 1
the 1
benevolent 1
approbation 1
of 1
m 1
waldman 1
d 1
n 1
the 1
fellow 1
cried 1
he 1
why 1

he 1
has 1
outstript 1
us 1
all 1

nevertheless 1

youngster 1

but 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
believed 1
in 1
cornelius 1

as 1
firmly 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
gospel 1
has 1
now 1
set 1
himself 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
university 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
soon 1
pulled 1
down 1

shall 1
all 1

i 1
was 1
myself 1
when 1
young 1
but 1
that 1
wears 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
m 1
krempe 1
had 1
now 1
commenced 1
an 1
eulogy 1
on 1
himself 1
which 1
happily 1
turned 1
the 1
conversation 1
from 1
a 1
subject 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
annoying 1
to 1
me 1
clerval 1
had 1
never 1
sympathized 1
in 1
my 1
tastes 1
for 1
natural 1
science 1
and 1
his 1
literary 1
pursuits 1
differed 1
wholly 1
from 1
those 1
which 1
had 1
occupied 1
me 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
university 1
with 1
the 1
design 1
of 1
making 1
himself 1
complete 1
master 1
of 1
the 1
oriental 1
languages 1
and 1
thus 1
he 1
should 1
open 1
a 1
field 1
for 1
the 1
plan 1
of 1
life 1
he 1
had 1
marked 1
out 1
for 1
himself 1
resolved 1
to 1
pursue 1
no 1
inglorious 1
career 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
eyes 1
toward 1
the 1
east 1
as 1
affording 1
scope 1
for 1
his 1
spirit 1
of 1
enterprise 1
the 1
persian 1
arabic 1
and 1
sanskrit 1
languages 1
engaged 1
his 1
attention 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
easily 1
induced 1
to 1
enter 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
studies 1
idleness 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
reflection 1
and 1
hated 1
my 1
former 1
studies 1
i 1
felt 1
great 1
relief 1
in 1
being 1
the 1
fellow 1
pupil 1
with 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
found 1
not 1
only 1
instruction 1
but 1
consolation 1
in 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
the 1
orientalists 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
him 1
attempt 1
a 1
critical 1
knowledge 1
of 1
their 1
dialects 1
for 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
contemplate 1
making 1
any 1
other 1
use 1
of 1
them 1
than 1
temporary 1
amusement 1
i 1
read 1
merely 1
to 1
understand 1
their 1
meaning 1
and 1
they 1
well 1
repaid 1
my 1
labours 1
their 1
melancholy 1
is 1
soothing 1
and 1
their 1
joy 1
elevating 1
to 1
a 1
degree 1
i 1
never 1
experienced 1
in 1
studying 1
the 1
authors 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
country 1
when 1
you 1
read 1
their 1
writings 1
life 1
appears 1
to 1
consist 1
in 1
a 1
warm 1
sun 1
and 1
a 1
garden 1
of 1
roses 1
in 1
the 1
smiles 1
and 1
frowns 1
of 1
a 1
fair 1
enemy 1
and 1
the 1
fire 1
that 1
consumes 1
your 1
own 1
heart 1
how 1
different 1
from 1
the 1
manly 1
and 1
heroical 1
poetry 1
of 1
greece 1
and 1
rome 1
summer 1
passed 1
away 1
in 1
these 1
occupations 1
and 1
my 1
return 1
to 1
geneva 1
was 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
latter 1
end 1
of 1
autumn 1
but 1
being 1
delayed 1
by 1
several 1
accidents 1
winter 1
and 1
snow 1
arrived 1
the 1
roads 1
were 1
deemed 1
impassable 1
and 1
my 1
journey 1
was 1
retarded 1
until 1
the 1
ensuing 1
spring 1
i 1
felt 1
this 1
delay 1
very 1
bitterly 1
for 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
and 1
my 1
beloved 1
friends 1
my 1
return 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
delayed 1
so 1
long 1
from 1
an 1
unwillingness 1
to 1
leave 1
clerval 1
in 1
a 1
strange 1
place 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
any 1
of 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
the 1
winter 1
however 1
was 1
spent 1
cheerfully 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
spring 1
was 1
uncommonly 1
late 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
its 1
beauty 1
compensated 1
for 1
its 1
dilatoriness 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
may 1
had 1
already 1
commenced 1
and 1
i 1
expected 1
the 1
letter 1
daily 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
fix 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
when 1
henry 1
proposed 1
a 1
pedestrian 1
tour 1
in 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
ingolstadt 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
bid 1
a 1
personal 1
farewell 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
inhabited 1
i 1
acceded 1
with 1
pleasure 1
to 1
this 1
proposition 1
i 1
was 1
fond 1
of 1
exercise 1
and 1
clerval 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
my 1
favourite 1
companion 1
in 1
the 1
ramble 1
of 1
this 1
nature 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
among 1
the 1
scenes 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
we 1
passed 1
a 1
fortnight 1
in 1
these 1
perambulations 1
my 1
health 1
and 1
spirits 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
restored 1
and 1
they 1
gained 1
additional 1
strength 1
from 1
the 1
salubrious 1
air 1
i 1
breathed 1
the 1
natural 1
incidents 1
of 1
our 1
progress 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
study 1
had 1
before 1
secluded 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
intercourse 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
and 1
rendered 1
me 1
unsocial 1
but 1
clerval 1
called 1
forth 1
the 1
better 1
feelings 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
he 1
again 1
taught 1
me 1
to 1
love 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
nature 1
and 1
the 1
cheerful 1
faces 1
of 1
children 1
excellent 1
friend 1
how 1
sincerely 1
you 1
did 1
love 1
me 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
elevate 1
my 1
mind 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
level 1
with 1
your 1
own 1
a 1
selfish 1
pursuit 1
had 1
cramped 1
and 1
narrowed 1
me 1
until 1
your 1
gentleness 1
and 1
affection 1
warmed 1
and 1
opened 1
my 1
senses 1
i 1
became 1
the 1
same 1
happy 1
creature 1
who 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
loved 1
and 1
beloved 1
by 1
all 1
had 1
no 1
sorrow 1
or 1
care 1
when 1
happy 1
inanimate 1
nature 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
bestowing 1
on 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
sensations 1
a 1
serene 1
sky 1
and 1
verdant 1
fields 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
ecstasy 1
the 1
present 1
season 1
was 1
indeed 1
divine 1
the 1
flowers 1
of 1
spring 1
bloomed 1
in 1
the 1
hedges 1
while 1
those 1
of 1
summer 1
were 1
already 1
in 1
bud 1
i 1
was 1
undisturbed 1
by 1
thoughts 1
which 1
during 1
the 1
preceding 1
year 1
had 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
notwithstanding 1
my 1
endeavours 1
to 1
throw 1
them 1
off 1
with 1
an 1
invincible 1
burden 1
henry 1
rejoiced 1
in 1
my 1
gaiety 1
and 1
sincerely 1
sympathised 1
in 1
my 1
feelings 1
he 1
exerted 1
himself 1
to 1
amuse 1
me 1
while 1
he 1
expressed 1
the 1
sensations 1
that 1
filled 1
his 1
soul 1
the 1
resources 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
were 1
truly 1
astonishing 1
his 1
conversation 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
imagination 1
and 1
very 1
often 1
in 1
imitation 1
of 1
the 1
persian 1
and 1
arabic 1
writers 1
he 1
invented 1
tales 1
of 1
wonderful 1
fancy 1
and 1
passion 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
he 1
repeated 1
my 1
favourite 1
poems 1
or 1
drew 1
me 1
out 1
into 1
arguments 1
which 1
he 1
supported 1
with 1
great 1
ingenuity 1
we 1
returned 1
to 1
our 1
college 1
on 1
a 1
sunday 1
afternoon 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
dancing 1
and 1
every 1
one 1
we 1
met 1
appeared 1
gay 1
and 1
happy 1
my 1
own 1
spirits 1
were 1
high 1
and 1
i 1
bounded 1
along 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
unbridled 1
joy 1
and 1
hilarity 1

on 1
my 1
return 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
from 1
my 1
father 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
you 1
have 1
probably 1
waited 1
impatiently 1
for 1
a 1
letter 1
to 1
fix 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
your 1
return 1
to 1
us 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
tempted 1
to 1
write 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
lines 1
merely 1
mentioning 1
the 1
day 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
expect 1
you 1
but 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
cruel 1
kindness 1
and 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
what 1
would 1
be 1
your 1
surprise 1
my 1
son 1
when 1
you 1
expected 1
a 1
happy 1
and 1
glad 1
welcome 1
to 1
behold 1
on 1
the 1
contrary 1
tears 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
how 1
victor 1
can 1
i 1
relate 1
our 1
misfortune 1
absence 1
cannot 1
have 1
rendered 1
you 1
callous 1
to 1
our 1
joys 1
and 1
griefs 1
and 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
inflict 1
pain 1
on 1
my 1
long 1
absent 1
son 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
prepare 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
woeful 1
news 1
but 1
i 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
even 1
now 1
your 1
eye 1
skims 1
over 1
the 1
page 1
to 1
seek 1
the 1
words 1
which 1
are 1
to 1
convey 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
horrible 1
tidings 1
william 1
is 1
dead 1
that 1
sweet 1
child 1
whose 1
smiles 1
delighted 1
and 1
warmed 1
my 1
heart 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
gentle 1
yet 1
so 1
gay 1
victor 1
he 1
is 1
murdered 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
attempt 1
to 1
console 1
you 1
but 1
will 1
simply 1
relate 1
the 1
circumstances 1
of 1
the 1
transaction 1
last 1
thursday 1
may 1
7th 1
i 1
my 1
niece 1
and 1
your 1
two 1
brothers 1
went 1
to 1
walk 1
in 1
plainpalais 1
the 1
evening 1
was 1
warm 1
and 1
serene 1
and 1
we 1
prolonged 1
our 1
walk 1
farther 1
than 1
usual 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
dusk 1
before 1
we 1
thought 1
of 1
returning 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
discovered 1
that 1
william 1
and 1
ernest 1
who 1
had 1
gone 1
on 1
before 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
we 1
accordingly 1
rested 1
on 1
a 1
seat 1
until 1
they 1
should 1
return 1
presently 1
ernest 1
came 1
and 1
enquired 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
his 1
brother 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
playing 1
with 1
him 1
that 1
william 1
had 1
run 1
away 1
to 1
hide 1
himself 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
vainly 1
sought 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
afterwards 1
waited 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
this 1
account 1
rather 1
alarmed 1
us 1
and 1
we 1
continued 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
him 1
until 1
night 1
fell 1
when 1
elizabeth 1
conjectured 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
we 1
returned 1
again 1
with 1
torches 1
for 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
rest 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
sweet 1
boy 1
had 1
lost 1
himself 1
and 1
was 1
exposed 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
damps 1
and 1
dews 1
of 1
night 1
elizabeth 1
also 1
suffered 1
extreme 1
anguish 1
about 1
five 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
discovered 1
my 1
lovely 1
boy 1
whom 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
blooming 1
and 1
active 1
in 1
health 1
stretched 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
livid 1
and 1
motionless 1
the 1
print 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
s 1
finger 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
he 1
was 1
conveyed 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
anguish 1
that 1
was 1
visible 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
betrayed 1
the 1
secret 1
to 1
elizabeth 1
she 1
was 1
very 1
earnest 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
corpse 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
attempted 1
to 1
prevent 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
persisted 1
and 1
entering 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
it 1
lay 1
hastily 1
examined 1
the 1
neck 1
of 1
the 1
victim 1
and 1
clasping 1
her 1
hands 1
exclaimed 1
o 1
god 1
i 1
have 1
murdered 1
my 1
darling 1
child 1
she 1
fainted 1
and 1
was 1
restored 1
with 1
extreme 1
difficulty 1
when 1
she 1
again 1
lived 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
weep 1
and 1
sigh 1
she 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
that 1
same 1
evening 1
william 1
had 1
teased 1
her 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
wear 1
a 1
very 1
valuable 1
miniature 1
that 1
she 1
possessed 1
of 1
your 1
mother 1
this 1
picture 1
is 1
gone 1
and 1
was 1
doubtless 1
the 1
temptation 1
which 1
urged 1
the 1
murderer 1
to 1
the 1
deed 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
at 1
present 1
although 1
our 1
exertions 1
to 1
discover 1
him 1
are 1
unremitted 1
but 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
restore 1
my 1
beloved 1
william 1
come 1
dearest 1
victor 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
console 1
elizabeth 1
she 1
weeps 1
continually 1
and 1
accuses 1
herself 1
unjustly 1
as 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
her 1
words 1
pierce 1
my 1
heart 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
unhappy 1
but 1
will 1
not 1
that 1
be 1
an 1
additional 1
motive 1
for 1
you 1
my 1
son 1
to 1
return 1
and 1
be 1
our 1
comforter 1
your 1
dear 1
mother 1
alas 1
victor 1
i 1
now 1
say 1
thank 1
god 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
live 1
to 1
witness 1
the 1
cruel 1
miserable 1
death 1
of 1
her 1
youngest 1
darling 1
come 1
victor 1
not 1
brooding 1
thoughts 1
of 1
vengeance 1
against 1
the 1
assassin 1
but 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
peace 1
and 1
gentleness 1
that 1
will 1
heal 1
instead 1
of 1
festering 1
the 1
wounds 1
of 1
our 1
minds 1
enter 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
with 1
kindness 1
and 1
affection 1
for 1
those 1
who 1
love 1
you 1
and 1
not 1
with 1
hatred 1
for 1
your 1
enemies 1
your 1
affectionate 1
and 1
afflicted 1
father 1
alphonse 1
frankenstein 1
geneva 1
may 1
12th 1
17 1
clerval 1
who 1
had 1
watched 1
my 1
countenance 1
as 1
i 1
read 1
this 1
letter 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
observe 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
succeeded 1
the 1
joy 1
i 1
at 1
first 1
expressed 1
on 1
receiving 1
new 1
from 1
my 1
friends 1
i 1
threw 1
the 1
letter 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
covered 1
my 1
face 1
with 1
my 1
hands 1
my 1
dear 1
frankenstein 1
exclaimed 1
henry 1
when 1
he 1
perceived 1
me 1
weep 1
with 1
bitterness 1
are 1
you 1
always 1
to 1
be 1
unhappy 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
i 1
motioned 1
him 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
the 1
letter 1
while 1
i 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
extremest 1
agitation 1
tears 1
also 1
gushed 1
from 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
clerval 1
as 1
he 1
read 1
the 1
account 1
of 1
my 1
misfortune 1
i 1
can 1
offer 1
you 1
no 1
consolation 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
your 1
disaster 1
is 1
irreparable 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
intend 1
to 1
do 1
to 1
go 1
instantly 1
to 1
geneva 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
henry 1
to 1
order 1
the 1
horses 1
during 1
our 1
walk 1
clerval 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
say 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
of 1
consolation 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
express 1
his 1
heartfelt 1
sympathy 1
poor 1
william 1
said 1
he 1
dear 1
lovely 1
child 1
he 1
now 1
sleeps 1
with 1
his 1
angel 1
mother 1
who 1
that 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
bright 1
and 1
joyous 1
in 1
his 1
young 1
beauty 1
but 1
must 1
weep 1
over 1
his 1
untimely 1
loss 1
to 1
die 1
so 1
miserably 1
to 1
feel 1
the 1
murderer 1
s 1
grasp 1
how 1
much 1
more 1
a 1
murdered 1
that 1
could 1
destroy 1
radiant 1
innocence 1
poor 1
little 1
fellow 1
one 1
only 1
consolation 1
have 1
we 1
his 1
friends 1
mourn 1
and 1
weep 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
at 1
rest 1
the 1
pang 1
is 1
over 1
his 1
sufferings 1
are 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
for 1
ever 1
a 1
sod 1
covers 1
his 1
gentle 1
form 1
and 1
he 1
knows 1
no 1
pain 1
he 1
can 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
a 1
subject 1
for 1
pity 1
we 1
must 1
reserve 1
that 1
for 1
his 1
miserable 1
survivors 1
clerval 1
spoke 1
thus 1
as 1
we 1
hurried 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
the 1
words 1
impressed 1
themselves 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
i 1
remembered 1
them 1
afterwards 1
in 1
solitude 1
but 1
now 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
horses 1
arrived 1
i 1
hurried 1
into 1
a 1
cabriolet 1
and 1
bade 1
farewell 1
to 1
my 1
friend 1
my 1
journey 1
was 1
very 1
melancholy 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
hurry 1
on 1
for 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
console 1
and 1
sympathise 1
with 1
my 1
loved 1
and 1
sorrowing 1
friends 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
drew 1
near 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
i 1
slackened 1
my 1
progress 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
sustain 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
feelings 1
that 1
crowded 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
passed 1
through 1
scenes 1
familiar 1
to 1
my 1
youth 1
but 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
for 1
nearly 1
six 1
years 1
how 1
altered 1
every 1
thing 1
might 1
be 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
one 1
sudden 1
and 1
desolating 1
change 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
but 1
a 1
thousand 1
little 1
circumstances 1
might 1
have 1
by 1
degrees 1
worked 1
other 1
alterations 1
which 1
although 1
they 1
were 1
done 1
more 1
tranquilly 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
less 1
decisive 1
fear 1
overcame 1
me 1
i 1
dared 1
no 1
advance 1
dreading 1
a 1
thousand 1
nameless 1
evils 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
tremble 1
although 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
define 1
them 1
i 1
remained 1
two 1
days 1
at 1
lausanne 1
in 1
this 1
painful 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
i 1
contemplated 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
waters 1
were 1
placid 1
all 1
around 1
was 1
calm 1
and 1
the 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
the 1
palaces 1
of 1
nature 1
were 1
not 1
changed 1
by 1
degrees 1
the 1
calm 1
and 1
heavenly 1
scene 1
restored 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
continued 1
my 1
journey 1
towards 1
geneva 1
the 1
road 1
ran 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
which 1
became 1
narrower 1
as 1
i 1
approached 1
my 1
native 1
town 1
i 1
discovered 1
more 1
distinctly 1
the 1
black 1
sides 1
of 1
jura 1
and 1
the 1
bright 1
summit 1
of 1
mont 1
blanc 1
i 1
wept 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
dear 1
mountains 1
my 1
own 1
beautiful 1
lake 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
welcome 1
your 1
wanderer 1
your 1
summits 1
are 1
clear 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
lake 1
are 1
blue 1
and 1
placid 1
is 1
this 1
to 1
prognosticate 1
peace 1
or 1
to 1
mock 1
at 1
my 1
unhappiness 1
i 1
fear 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
render 1
myself 1
tedious 1
by 1
dwelling 1
on 1
these 1
preliminary 1
circumstances 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
days 1
of 1
comparative 1
happiness 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
pleasure 1
my 1
country 1
my 1
beloved 1
country 1
who 1
but 1
a 1
native 1
can 1
tell 1
the 1
delight 1
i 1
took 1
in 1
again 1
beholding 1
thy 1
streams 1
thy 1
mountains 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
thy 1
lovely 1
lake 1
yet 1
as 1
i 1
drew 1
nearer 1
home 1
grief 1
and 1
fear 1
again 1
overcame 1
me 1
night 1
also 1
closed 1
around 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
see 1
the 1
dark 1
mountains 1
i 1
felt 1
still 1
more 1
gloomily 1
the 1
picture 1
appeared 1
a 1
vast 1
and 1
dim 1
scene 1
of 1
evil 1
and 1
i 1
foresaw 1
obscurely 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
become 1
the 1
most 1
wretched 1
of 1
human 1
beings 1
alas 1
i 1
prophesied 1
truly 1
and 1
failed 1
only 1
in 1
one 1
single 1
circumstance 1
that 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
misery 1
i 1
imagined 1
and 1
dreaded 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
conceive 1
the 1
hundredth 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
anguish 1
i 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
endure 1
it 1
was 1
completely 1
dark 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
in 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
geneva 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
were 1
already 1
shut 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
night 1
at 1
secheron 1
a 1
village 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
the 1
city 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
serene 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
rest 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
visit 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
my 1
poor 1
william 1
had 1
been 1
murdered 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
pass 1
through 1
the 1
town 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
cross 1
the 1
lake 1
in 1
a 1
boat 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
plainpalais 1
during 1
this 1
short 1
voyage 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
lightning 1
playing 1
on 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
mont 1
blanc 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
figures 1
the 1
storm 1
appeared 1
to 1
approach 1
rapidly 1
and 1
on 1
landing 1
i 1
ascended 1
a 1
low 1
hill 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
observe 1
its 1
progress 1
it 1
advanced 1
the 1
heavens 1
were 1
clouded 1
and 1
i 1
soon 1
felt 1
the 1
rain 1
coming 1
slowly 1
in 1
large 1
drops 1
but 1
its 1
violence 1
quickly 1
increased 1
i 1
quitted 1
my 1
seat 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
although 1
the 1
darkness 1
and 1
storm 1
increased 1
every 1
minute 1
and 1
the 1
thunder 1
burst 1
with 1
a 1
terrific 1
crash 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
it 1
was 1
echoed 1
from 1
saleve 1
the 1
juras 1
and 1
the 1
alps 1
of 1
savoy 1
vivid 1
flashes 1
of 1
lightning 1
dazzled 1
my 1
eyes 1
illuminating 1
the 1
lake 1
making 1
it 1
appear 1
like 1
a 1
vast 1
sheet 1
of 1
fire 1
then 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
every 1
thing 1
seemed 1
of 1
a 1
pitchy 1
darkness 1
until 1
the 1
eye 1
recovered 1
itself 1
from 1
the 1
preceding 1
flash 1
the 1
storm 1
as 1
is 1
often 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
switzerland 1
appeared 1
at 1
once 1
in 1
various 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
heavens 1
the 1
most 1
violent 1
storm 1
hung 1
exactly 1
north 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
over 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
which 1
lies 1
between 1
the 1
promontory 1
of 1
belrive 1
and 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
copet 1
another 1
storm 1
enlightened 1
jura 1
with 1
faint 1
flashes 1
and 1
another 1
darkened 1
and 1
sometimes 1
disclosed 1
the 1
mole 1
a 1
peaked 1
mountain 1
to 1
the 1
east 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
while 1
i 1
watched 1
the 1
tempest 1
so 1
beautiful 1
yet 1
terrific 1
i 1
wandered 1
on 1
with 1
a 1
hasty 1
step 1
this 1
noble 1
war 1
in 1
the 1
sky 1
elevated 1
my 1
spirits 1
i 1
clasped 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
aloud 1
william 1
dear 1
angel 1
this 1
is 1
thy 1
funeral 1
this 1
thy 1
dirge 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
these 1
words 1
i 1
perceived 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
a 1
figure 1
which 1
stole 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
trees 1
near 1
me 1
i 1
stood 1
fixed 1
gazing 1
intently 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
mistaken 1
a 1
flash 1
of 1
lightning 1
illuminated 1
the 1
object 1
and 1
discovered 1
its 1
shape 1
plainly 1
to 1
me 1
its 1
gigantic 1
stature 1
and 1
the 1
deformity 1
of 1
its 1
aspect 1
more 1
hideous 1
than 1
belongs 1
to 1
humanity 1
instantly 1
informed 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
wretch 1
the 1
filthy 1
daemon 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
given 1
life 1
what 1
did 1
he 1
there 1
could 1
he 1
be 1
i 1
shuddered 1
at 1
the 1
conception 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
no 1
sooner 1
did 1
that 1
idea 1
cross 1
my 1
imagination 1
than 1
i 1
became 1
convinced 1
of 1
its 1
truth 1
my 1
teeth 1
chattered 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
lean 1
against 1
a 1
tree 1
for 1
support 1
the 1
figure 1
passed 1
me 1
quickly 1
and 1
i 1
lost 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
nothing 1
in 1
human 1
shape 1
could 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
fair 1
child 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
murderer 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
doubt 1
it 1
the 1
mere 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
idea 1
was 1
an 1
irresistible 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
pursuing 1
the 1
devil 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
another 1
flash 1
discovered 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
hanging 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
of 1
the 1
nearly 1
perpendicular 1
ascent 1
of 1
mont 1
saleve 1
a 1
hill 1
that 1
bounds 1
plainpalais 1
on 1
the 1
south 1
he 1
soon 1
reached 1
the 1
summit 1
and 1
disappeared 1
i 1
remained 1
motionless 1
the 1
thunder 1
ceased 1
but 1
the 1
rain 1
still 1
continued 1
and 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
enveloped 1
in 1
an 1
impenetrable 1
darkness 1
i 1
revolved 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
the 1
events 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
until 1
now 1
sought 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
whole 1
train 1
of 1
my 1
progress 1
toward 1
the 1
creation 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
hands 1
at 1
my 1
bedside 1
its 1
departure 1
two 1
years 1
had 1
now 1
nearly 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
first 1
received 1
life 1
and 1
was 1
this 1
his 1
first 1
crime 1
alas 1
i 1
had 1
turned 1
loose 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
a 1
depraved 1
wretch 1
whose 1
delight 1
was 1
in 1
carnage 1
and 1
misery 1
had 1
he 1
not 1
murdered 1
my 1
brother 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
conceive 1
the 1
anguish 1
i 1
suffered 1
during 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
which 1
i 1
spent 1
cold 1
and 1
wet 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
the 1
inconvenience 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
my 1
imagination 1
was 1
busy 1
in 1
scenes 1
of 1
evil 1
and 1
despair 1
i 1
considered 1
the 1
being 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
cast 1
among 1
mankind 1
and 1
endowed 1
with 1
the 1
will 1
and 1
power 1
to 1
effect 1
purposes 1
of 1
horror 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
deed 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
now 1
done 1
nearly 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
vampire 1
my 1
own 1
spirit 1
let 1
loose 1
from 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
forced 1
to 1
destroy 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
day 1
dawned 1
and 1
i 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
town 1
the 1
gates 1
were 1
open 1
and 1
i 1
hastened 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
my 1
first 1
thought 1
was 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
i 1
knew 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
and 1
cause 1
instant 1
pursuit 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
but 1
i 1
paused 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
the 1
story 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
tell 1
a 1
being 1
whom 1
i 1
myself 1
had 1
formed 1
and 1
endued 1
with 1
life 1
had 1
met 1
me 1
at 1
midnight 1
among 1
the 1
precipices 1
of 1
an 1
inaccessible 1
mountain 1
i 1
remembered 1
also 1
the 1
nervous 1
fever 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
seized 1
just 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
dated 1
my 1
creation 1
and 1
which 1
would 1
give 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
delirium 1
to 1
a 1
tale 1
otherwise 1
so 1
utterly 1
improbable 1
i 1
well 1
knew 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
other 1
had 1
communicated 1
such 1
a 1
relation 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
looked 1
upon 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
ravings 1
of 1
insanity 1
besides 1
the 1
strange 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
animal 1
would 1
elude 1
all 1
pursuit 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
so 1
far 1
credited 1
as 1
to 1
persuade 1
my 1
relatives 1
to 1
commence 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
of 1
what 1
use 1
would 1
be 1
pursuit 1
who 1
could 1
arrest 1
a 1
creature 1
capable 1
of 1
scaling 1
the 1
overhanging 1
sides 1
of 1
mont 1
saleve 1
these 1
reflections 1
determined 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
remain 1
silent 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
when 1
i 1
entered 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
i 1
told 1
the 1
servants 1
not 1
to 1
disturb 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
library 1
to 1
attend 1
their 1
usual 1
hour 1
of 1
rising 1
six 1
years 1
had 1
elapsed 1
passed 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
but 1
for 1
one 1
indelible 1
trace 1
and 1
i 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
last 1
embraced 1
my 1
father 1
before 1
my 1
departure 1
for 1
ingolstadt 1
beloved 1
and 1
venerable 1
parent 1
he 1
still 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
gazed 1
on 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
which 1
stood 1
over 1
the 1
mantel 1
piece 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
historical 1
subject 1
painted 1
at 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
desire 1
and 1
represented 1
caroline 1
beaufort 1
in 1
an 1
agony 1
of 1
despair 1
kneeling 1
by 1
the 1
coffin 1
of 1
her 1
dead 1
father 1
her 1
garb 1
was 1
rustic 1
and 1
her 1
cheek 1
pale 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
dignity 1
and 1
beauty 1
that 1
hardly 1
permitted 1
the 1
sentiment 1
of 1
pity 1
below 1
this 1
picture 1
was 1
a 1
miniature 1
of 1
william 1
and 1
my 1
tears 1
flowed 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
it 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
thus 1
engaged 1
ernest 1
entered 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
me 1
arrive 1
and 1
hastened 1
to 1
welcome 1
me 1
welcome 1
my 1
dearest 1
victor 1
said 1
he 1
ah 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
had 1
come 1
three 1
months 1
ago 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
found 1
us 1
all 1
joyous 1
and 1
delighted 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
now 1
to 1
share 1
a 1
misery 1
which 1
nothing 1
can 1
alleviate 1
yet 1
your 1
presence 1
will 1
i 1
hope 1
revive 1
our 1
father 1
who 1
seems 1
sinking 1
under 1
his 1
misfortune 1
and 1
your 1
persuasions 1
will 1
induce 1
poor 1
elizabeth 1
to 1
cease 1
her 1
vain 1
and 1
tormenting 1
self 1
accusations 1
poor 1
william 1
he 1
was 1
our 1
darling 1
and 1
our 1
pride 1
tears 1
unrestrained 1
fell 1
from 1
my 1
brother 1
s 1
eyes 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
mortal 1
agony 1
crept 1
over 1
my 1
frame 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
only 1
imagined 1
the 1
wretchedness 1
of 1
my 1
desolated 1
home 1
the 1
reality 1
came 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
a 1
not 1
less 1
terrible 1
disaster 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
calm 1
ernest 1
i 1
enquired 1
more 1
minutely 1
concerning 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
named 1
my 1
cousin 1
she 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
said 1
ernest 1
requires 1
consolation 1
she 1
accused 1
herself 1
of 1
having 1
caused 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
her 1
very 1
wretched 1
but 1
since 1
the 1
murderer 1
has 1
been 1
discovered 1
the 1
murderer 1
discovered 1
good 1
god 1
how 1
can 1
that 1
be 1
who 1
could 1
attempt 1
to 1
pursue 1
him 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
one 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
try 1
to 1
overtake 1
the 1
winds 1
or 1
confine 1
a 1
mountain 1
stream 1
with 1
a 1
straw 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
too 1
he 1
was 1
free 1
last 1
night 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
mean 1
replied 1
my 1
brother 1
in 1
accents 1
of 1
wonder 1
but 1
to 1
us 1
the 1
discovery 1
we 1
have 1
made 1
completes 1
our 1
misery 1
no 1
one 1
would 1
believe 1
it 1
at 1
first 1
and 1
even 1
now 1
elizabeth 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
convinced 1
notwithstanding 1
all 1
the 1
evidence 1
indeed 1
who 1
would 1
credit 1
that 1
justine 1
moritz 1
who 1
was 1
so 1
amiable 1
and 1
fond 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
family 1
could 1
suddenly 1
become 1
so 1
capable 1
of 1
so 1
frightful 1
so 1
appalling 1
a 1
crime 1
justine 1
moritz 1
poor 1
poor 1
girl 1
is 1
she 1
the 1
accused 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
wrongfully 1
every 1
one 1
knows 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
believes 1
it 1
surely 1
ernest 1
no 1
one 1
did 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
several 1
circumstances 1
came 1
out 1
that 1
have 1
almost 1
forced 1
conviction 1
upon 1
us 1
and 1
her 1
own 1
behaviour 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
confused 1
as 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
evidence 1
of 1
facts 1
a 1
weight 1
that 1
i 1
fear 1
leaves 1
no 1
hope 1
for 1
doubt 1
but 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
tried 1
today 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
hear 1
all 1
he 1
then 1
related 1
that 1
the 1
morning 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
poor 1
william 1
had 1
been 1
discovered 1
justine 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
ill 1
and 1
confined 1
to 1
her 1
bed 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
during 1
this 1
interval 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
happening 1
to 1
examine 1
the 1
apparel 1
she 1
had 1
worn 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
discovered 1
in 1
her 1
pocket 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
judged 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
temptation 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
the 1
servant 1
instantly 1
showed 1
it 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
who 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
upon 1
their 1
deposition 1
justine 1
was 1
apprehended 1
on 1
being 1
charged 1
with 1
the 1
fact 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
confirmed 1
the 1
suspicion 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
measure 1
by 1
her 1
extreme 1
confusion 1
of 1
manner 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
strange 1
tale 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
shake 1
my 1
faith 1
and 1
i 1
replied 1
earnestly 1
you 1
are 1
all 1
mistaken 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
murderer 1
justine 1
poor 1
good 1
justine 1
is 1
innocent 1
at 1
that 1
instant 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
i 1
saw 1
unhappiness 1
deeply 1
impressed 1
on 1
his 1
countenance 1
but 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
welcome 1
me 1
cheerfully 1
and 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
exchanged 1
our 1
mournful 1
greeting 1
would 1
have 1
introduced 1
some 1
other 1
topic 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
our 1
disaster 1
had 1
not 1
ernest 1
exclaimed 1
good 1
god 1
papa 1
victor 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
poor 1
william 1
we 1
do 1
also 1
unfortunately 1
replied 1
my 1
father 1
for 1
indeed 1
i 1
had 1
rather 1
have 1
been 1
for 1
ever 1
ignorant 1
than 1
have 1
discovered 1
so 1
much 1
depravity 1
and 1
ungratitude 1
in 1
one 1
i 1
valued 1
so 1
highly 1
my 1
dear 1
father 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
justine 1
is 1
innocent 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
god 1
forbid 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
suffer 1
as 1
guilty 1
she 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
tried 1
today 1
and 1
i 1
hope 1
i 1
sincerely 1
hope 1
that 1
she 1
will 1
be 1
acquitted 1
this 1
speech 1
calmed 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
firmly 1
convinced 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
justine 1
and 1
indeed 1
every 1
human 1
being 1
was 1
guiltless 1
of 1
this 1
murder 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
fear 1
therefore 1
that 1
any 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
could 1
be 1
brought 1
forward 1
strong 1
enough 1
to 1
convict 1
her 1
my 1
tale 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
to 1
announce 1
publicly 1
its 1
astounding 1
horror 1
would 1
be 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
madness 1
by 1
the 1
vulgar 1
did 1
any 1
one 1
indeed 1
exist 1
except 1
i 1
the 1
creator 1
who 1
would 1
believe 1
unless 1
his 1
senses 1
convinced 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
monument 1
of 1
presumption 1
and 1
rash 1
ignorance 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
let 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
world 1
we 1
were 1
soon 1
joined 1
by 1
elizabeth 1
time 1
had 1
altered 1
her 1
since 1
i 1
last 1
beheld 1
her 1
it 1
had 1
endowed 1
her 1
with 1
loveliness 1
surpassing 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
her 1
childish 1
years 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
candour 1
the 1
same 1
vivacity 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
allied 1
to 1
an 1
expression 1
more 1
full 1
of 1
sensibility 1
and 1
intellect 1
she 1
welcomed 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
affection 1
your 1
arrival 1
my 1
dear 1
cousin 1
said 1
she 1
fills 1
me 1
with 1
hope 1
you 1
perhaps 1
will 1
find 1
some 1
means 1
to 1
justify 1
my 1
poor 1
guiltless 1
justine 1
alas 1
who 1
is 1
safe 1
if 1
she 1
be 1
convicted 1
of 1
crime 1
i 1
rely 1
on 1
her 1
innocence 1
as 1
certainly 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
upon 1
my 1
own 1
our 1
misfortune 1
is 1
doubly 1
hard 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
only 1
lost 1
that 1
lovely 1
darling 1
boy 1
but 1
this 1
poor 1
girl 1
whom 1
i 1
sincerely 1
love 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
torn 1
away 1
by 1
even 1
a 1
worse 1
fate 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
condemned 1
i 1
never 1
shall 1
know 1
joy 1
more 1
but 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
she 1
will 1
not 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
again 1
even 1
after 1
the 1
sad 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
william 1
she 1
is 1
innocent 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
said 1
i 1
and 1
that 1
shall 1
be 1
proved 1
fear 1
nothing 1
but 1
let 1
your 1
spirits 1
be 1
cheered 1
by 1
the 1
assurance 1
of 1
her 1
acquittal 1
how 1
kind 1
and 1
generous 1
you 1
are 1
every 1
one 1
else 1
believes 1
in 1
her 1
guilt 1
and 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
wretched 1
for 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
and 1
to 1
see 1
every 1
one 1
else 1
prejudiced 1
in 1
so 1
deadly 1
a 1
manner 1
rendered 1
me 1
hopeless 1
and 1
despairing 1
she 1
wept 1
dearest 1
niece 1
said 1
my 1
father 1
dry 1
your 1
tears 1
if 1
she 1
is 1
as 1
you 1
believe 1
innocent 1
rely 1
on 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
our 1
laws 1
and 1
the 1
activity 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
prevent 1
the 1
slightest 1
shadow 1
of 1
partiality 1
chapter 1
8 1
we 1
passed 1
a 1
few 1
sad 1
hours 1
until 1
eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
the 1
trial 1
was 1
to 1
commence 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
being 1
obliged 1
to 1
attend 1
as 1
witnesses 1
i 1
accompanied 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
during 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
this 1
wretched 1
mockery 1
of 1
justice 1
i 1
suffered 1
living 1
torture 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
decided 1
whether 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
my 1
curiosity 1
and 1
lawless 1
devices 1
would 1
cause 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
two 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
one 1
a 1
smiling 1
babe 1
full 1
of 1
innocence 1
and 1
joy 1
the 1
other 1
far 1
more 1
dreadfully 1
murdered 1
with 1
every 1
aggravation 1
of 1
infamy 1
that 1
could 1
make 1
the 1
murder 1
memorable 1
in 1
horror 1
justine 1
also 1
was 1
a 1
girl 1
of 1
merit 1
and 1
possessed 1
qualities 1
which 1
promised 1
to 1
render 1
her 1
life 1
happy 1
now 1
all 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
obliterated 1
in 1
an 1
ignominious 1
grave 1
and 1
i 1
the 1
cause 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
rather 1
would 1
i 1
have 1
confessed 1
myself 1
guilty 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
ascribed 1
to 1
justine 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
absent 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
committed 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
declaration 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
considered 1
as 1
the 1
ravings 1
of 1
a 1
madman 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
exculpated 1
her 1
who 1
suffered 1
through 1
me 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
justine 1
was 1
calm 1
she 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
mourning 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
always 1
engaging 1
was 1
rendered 1
by 1
the 1
solemnity 1
of 1
her 1
feelings 1
exquisitely 1
beautiful 1
yet 1
she 1
appeared 1
confident 1
in 1
innocence 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
tremble 1
although 1
gazed 1
on 1
and 1
execrated 1
by 1
thousands 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
kindness 1
which 1
her 1
beauty 1
might 1
otherwise 1
have 1
excited 1
was 1
obliterated 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
the 1
spectators 1
by 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
the 1
enormity 1
she 1
was 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
committed 1
she 1
was 1
tranquil 1
yet 1
her 1
tranquillity 1
was 1
evidently 1
constrained 1
and 1
as 1
her 1
confusion 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
adduced 1
as 1
a 1
proof 1
of 1
her 1
guilt 1
she 1
worked 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
to 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
courage 1
when 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
court 1
she 1
threw 1
her 1
eyes 1
round 1
it 1
and 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
where 1
we 1
were 1
seated 1
a 1
tear 1
seemed 1
to 1
dim 1
her 1
eye 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
us 1
but 1
she 1
quickly 1
recovered 1
herself 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
sorrowful 1
affection 1
seemed 1
to 1
attest 1
her 1
utter 1
guiltlessness 1
the 1
trial 1
began 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
advocate 1
against 1
her 1
had 1
stated 1
the 1
charge 1
several 1
witnesses 1
were 1
called 1
several 1
strange 1
facts 1
combined 1
against 1
her 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
staggered 1
anyone 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
such 1
proof 1
of 1
her 1
innocence 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
committed 1
and 1
towards 1
morning 1
had 1
been 1
perceived 1
by 1
a 1
market 1
woman 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
afterwards 1
found 1
the 1
woman 1
asked 1
her 1
what 1
she 1
did 1
there 1
but 1
she 1
looked 1
very 1
strangely 1
and 1
only 1
returned 1
a 1
confused 1
and 1
unintelligible 1
answer 1
she 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
about 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
when 1
one 1
inquired 1
where 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
replied 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
looking 1
for 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
demanded 1
earnestly 1
if 1
anything 1
had 1
been 1
heard 1
concerning 1
him 1
when 1
shown 1
the 1
body 1
she 1
fell 1
into 1
violent 1
hysterics 1
and 1
kept 1
her 1
bed 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
the 1
picture 1
was 1
then 1
produced 1
which 1
the 1
servant 1
had 1
found 1
in 1
her 1
pocket 1
and 1
when 1
elizabeth 1
in 1
a 1
faltering 1
voice 1
proved 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
which 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
the 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
missed 1
she 1
had 1
placed 1
round 1
his 1
neck 1
a 1
murmur 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
indignation 1
filled 1
the 1
court 1
justine 1
was 1
called 1
on 1
for 1
her 1
defence 1
as 1
the 1
trial 1
had 1
proceeded 1
her 1
countenance 1
had 1
altered 1
surprise 1
horror 1
and 1
misery 1
were 1
strongly 1
expressed 1
sometimes 1
she 1
struggled 1
with 1
her 1
tears 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
desired 1
to 1
plead 1
she 1
collected 1
her 1
powers 1
and 1
spoke 1
in 1
an 1
audible 1
although 1
variable 1
voice 1
god 1
knows 1
she 1
said 1
how 1
entirely 1
i 1
am 1
innocent 1
but 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
pretend 1
that 1
my 1
protestations 1
should 1
acquit 1
me 1
i 1
rest 1
my 1
innocence 1
on 1
a 1
plain 1
and 1
simple 1
explanation 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
adduced 1
against 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
hope 1
the 1
character 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
borne 1
will 1
incline 1
my 1
judges 1
to 1
a 1
favourable 1
interpretation 1
where 1
any 1
circumstance 1
appears 1
doubtful 1
or 1
suspicious 1
she 1
then 1
related 1
that 1
by 1
the 1
permission 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
evening 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
committed 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
an 1
aunt 1
at 1
chene 1
a 1
village 1
situated 1
at 1
about 1
a 1
league 1
from 1
geneva 1
on 1
her 1
return 1
at 1
about 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
she 1
met 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
asked 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
was 1
lost 1
she 1
was 1
alarmed 1
by 1
this 1
account 1
and 1
passed 1
several 1
hours 1
in 1
looking 1
for 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
gates 1
of 1
geneva 1
were 1
shut 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
remain 1
several 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
a 1
barn 1
belonging 1
to 1
a 1
cottage 1
being 1
unwilling 1
to 1
call 1
up 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
to 1
whom 1
she 1
was 1
well 1
known 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
she 1
spent 1
here 1
watching 1
towards 1
morning 1
she 1
believed 1
that 1
she 1
slept 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
some 1
steps 1
disturbed 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
awoke 1
it 1
was 1
dawn 1
and 1
she 1
quitted 1
her 1
asylum 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
again 1
endeavour 1
to 1
find 1
my 1
brother 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
his 1
body 1
lay 1
it 1
was 1
without 1
her 1
knowledge 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
bewildered 1
when 1
questioned 1
by 1
the 1
market 1
woman 1
was 1
not 1
surprising 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
a 1
sleepless 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
poor 1
william 1
was 1
yet 1
uncertain 1
concerning 1
the 1
picture 1
she 1
could 1
give 1
no 1
account 1
i 1
know 1
continued 1
the 1
unhappy 1
victim 1
how 1
heavily 1
and 1
fatally 1
this 1
one 1
circumstance 1
weighs 1
against 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
power 1
of 1
explaining 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
expressed 1
my 1
utter 1
ignorance 1
i 1
am 1
only 1
left 1
to 1
conjecture 1
concerning 1
the 1
probabilities 1
by 1
which 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
placed 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
but 1
here 1
also 1
i 1
am 1
checked 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
enemy 1
on 1
earth 1
and 1
none 1
surely 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
wicked 1
as 1
to 1
destroy 1
me 1
wantonly 1
did 1
the 1
murderer 1
place 1
it 1
there 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
no 1
opportunity 1
afforded 1
him 1
for 1
so 1
doing 1
or 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
have 1
stolen 1
the 1
jewel 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
it 1
again 1
so 1
soon 1
i 1
commit 1
my 1
cause 1
to 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
my 1
judges 1
yet 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
room 1
for 1
hope 1
i 1
beg 1
permission 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
few 1
witnesses 1
examined 1
concerning 1
my 1
character 1
and 1
if 1
their 1
testimony 1
shall 1
not 1
overweigh 1
my 1
supposed 1
guilt 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
condemned 1
although 1
i 1
would 1
pledge 1
my 1
salvation 1
on 1
my 1
innocence 1
several 1
witnesses 1
were 1
called 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
her 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
and 1
they 1
spoke 1
well 1
of 1
her 1
but 1
fear 1
and 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
of 1
which 1
they 1
supposed 1
her 1
guilty 1
rendered 1
them 1
timorous 1
and 1
unwilling 1
to 1
come 1
forward 1
elizabeth 1
saw 1
even 1
this 1
last 1
resource 1
her 1
excellent 1
dispositions 1
and 1
irreproachable 1
conduct 1
about 1
to 1
fail 1
the 1
accused 1
when 1
although 1
violently 1
agitated 1
she 1
desired 1
permission 1
to 1
address 1
the 1
court 1
i 1
am 1
said 1
she 1
the 1
cousin 1
of 1
the 1
unhappy 1
child 1
who 1
was 1
murdered 1
or 1
rather 1
his 1
sister 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
educated 1
by 1
and 1
have 1
lived 1
with 1
his 1
parents 1
ever 1
since 1
and 1
even 1
long 1
before 1
his 1
birth 1
it 1
may 1
therefore 1
be 1
judged 1
indecent 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
forward 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
fellow 1
creature 1
about 1
to 1
perish 1
through 1
the 1
cowardice 1
of 1
her 1
pretended 1
friends 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
speak 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
say 1
what 1
i 1
know 1
of 1
her 1
character 1
i 1
am 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
accused 1
i 1
have 1
lived 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
house 1
with 1
her 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
for 1
five 1
and 1
at 1
another 1
for 1
nearly 1
two 1
years 1
during 1
all 1
that 1
period 1
she 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
amiable 1
and 1
benevolent 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
she 1
nursed 1
madame 1
frankenstein 1
my 1
aunt 1
in 1
her 1
last 1
illness 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
affection 1
and 1
care 1
and 1
afterwards 1
attended 1
her 1
own 1
mother 1
during 1
a 1
tedious 1
illness 1
in 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
excited 1
the 1
admiration 1
of 1
all 1
who 1
knew 1
her 1
after 1
which 1
she 1
again 1
lived 1
in 1
my 1
uncle 1
s 1
house 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
beloved 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
family 1
she 1
was 1
warmly 1
attached 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
dead 1
and 1
acted 1
towards 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
most 1
affectionate 1
mother 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
hesitate 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
notwithstanding 1
all 1
the 1
evidence 1
produced 1
against 1
her 1
i 1
believe 1
and 1
rely 1
on 1
her 1
perfect 1
innocence 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
temptation 1
for 1
such 1
an 1
action 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
bauble 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
chief 1
proof 1
rests 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
earnestly 1
desired 1
it 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
willingly 1
given 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
so 1
much 1
do 1
i 1
esteem 1
and 1
value 1
her 1
a 1
murmur 1
of 1
approbation 1
followed 1
elizabeth 1
s 1
simple 1
and 1
powerful 1
appeal 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
excited 1
by 1
her 1
generous 1
interference 1
and 1
not 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
poor 1
justine 1
on 1
whom 1
the 1
public 1
indignation 1
was 1
turned 1
with 1
renewed 1
violence 1
charging 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
blackest 1
ingratitude 1
she 1
herself 1
wept 1
as 1
elizabeth 1
spoke 1
but 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
my 1
own 1
agitation 1
and 1
anguish 1
was 1
extreme 1
during 1
the 1
whole 1
trial 1
i 1
believed 1
in 1
her 1
innocence 1
i 1
knew 1
it 1
could 1
the 1
demon 1
who 1
had 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
doubt 1
murdered 1
my 1
brother 1
also 1
in 1
his 1
hellish 1
sport 1
have 1
betrayed 1
the 1
innocent 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
ignominy 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sustain 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
situation 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
popular 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
countenances 1
of 1
the 1
judges 1
had 1
already 1
condemned 1
my 1
unhappy 1
victim 1
i 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
in 1
agony 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
the 1
accused 1
did 1
not 1
equal 1
mine 1
she 1
was 1
sustained 1
by 1
innocence 1
but 1
the 1
fangs 1
of 1
remorse 1
tore 1
my 1
bosom 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
forgo 1
their 1
hold 1
i 1
passed 1
a 1
night 1
of 1
unmingled 1
wretchedness 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
court 1
my 1
lips 1
and 1
throat 1
were 1
parched 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
ask 1
the 1
fatal 1
question 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
known 1
and 1
the 1
officer 1
guessed 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
visit 1
the 1
ballots 1
had 1
been 1
thrown 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
black 1
and 1
justine 1
was 1
condemned 1
i 1
cannot 1
pretend 1
to 1
describe 1
what 1
i 1
then 1
felt 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
experienced 1
sensations 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
bestow 1
upon 1
them 1
adequate 1
expressions 1
but 1
words 1
cannot 1
convey 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
heart 1
sickening 1
despair 1
that 1
i 1
then 1
endured 1
the 1
person 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
addressed 1
myself 1
added 1
that 1
justine 1
had 1
already 1
confessed 1
her 1
guilt 1
that 1
evidence 1
he 1
observed 1
was 1
hardly 1
required 1
in 1
so 1
glaring 1
a 1
case 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
indeed 1
none 1
of 1
our 1
judges 1
like 1
to 1
condemn 1
a 1
criminal 1
upon 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
be 1
it 1
ever 1
so 1
decisive 1
this 1
was 1
strange 1
and 1
unexpected 1
intelligence 1
what 1
could 1
it 1
mean 1
had 1
my 1
eyes 1
deceived 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
i 1
really 1
as 1
mad 1
as 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
would 1
believe 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
if 1
i 1
disclosed 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
suspicions 1
i 1
hastened 1
to 1
return 1
home 1
and 1
elizabeth 1
eagerly 1
demanded 1
the 1
result 1
my 1
cousin 1
replied 1
i 1
it 1
is 1
decided 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
expected 1
all 1
judges 1
had 1
rather 1
that 1
ten 1
innocent 1
should 1
suffer 1
than 1
that 1
one 1
guilty 1
should 1
escape 1
but 1
she 1
has 1
confessed 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
dire 1
blow 1
to 1
poor 1
elizabeth 1
who 1
had 1
relied 1
with 1
firmness 1
upon 1
justine 1
s 1
innocence 1
alas 1
said 1
she 1
how 1
shall 1
i 1
ever 1
again 1
believe 1
in 1
human 1
goodness 1
justine 1
whom 1
i 1
loved 1
and 1
esteemed 1
as 1
my 1
sister 1
how 1
could 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
those 1
smiles 1
of 1
innocence 1
only 1
to 1
betray 1
her 1
mild 1
eyes 1
seemed 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
severity 1
or 1
guile 1
and 1
yet 1
she 1
has 1
committed 1
a 1
murder 1
soon 1
after 1
we 1
heard 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
victim 1
had 1
expressed 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
cousin 1
my 1
father 1
wished 1
her 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
but 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
left 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
judgment 1
and 1
feelings 1
to 1
decide 1
yes 1
said 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
although 1
she 1
is 1
guilty 1
and 1
you 1
victor 1
shall 1
accompany 1
me 1
i 1
cannot 1
go 1
alone 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
this 1
visit 1
was 1
torture 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
we 1
entered 1
the 1
gloomy 1
prison 1
chamber 1
and 1
beheld 1
justine 1
sitting 1
on 1
some 1
straw 1
at 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
her 1
hands 1
were 1
manacled 1
and 1
her 1
head 1
rested 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
she 1
rose 1
on 1
seeing 1
us 1
enter 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
left 1
alone 1
with 1
her 1
she 1
threw 1
herself 1
at 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
weeping 1
bitterly 1
my 1
cousin 1
wept 1
also 1
oh 1
justine 1
said 1
she 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
last 1
consolation 1
i 1
relied 1
on 1
your 1
innocence 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
was 1
then 1
very 1
wretched 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
miserable 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
also 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
so 1
very 1
very 1
wicked 1
do 1
you 1
also 1
join 1
with 1
my 1
enemies 1
to 1
crush 1
me 1
to 1
condemn 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
murderer 1
her 1
voice 1
was 1
suffocated 1
with 1
sobs 1
rise 1
my 1
poor 1
girl 1
said 1
elizabeth 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
kneel 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
innocent 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
enemies 1
i 1
believed 1
you 1
guiltless 1
notwithstanding 1
every 1
evidence 1
until 1
i 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
yourself 1
declared 1
your 1
guilt 1
that 1
report 1
you 1
say 1
is 1
false 1
and 1
be 1
assured 1
dear 1
justine 1
that 1
nothing 1
can 1
shake 1
my 1
confidence 1
in 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
your 1
own 1
confession 1
i 1
did 1
confess 1
but 1
i 1
confessed 1
a 1
lie 1
i 1
confessed 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
obtain 1
absolution 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
falsehood 1
lies 1
heavier 1
at 1
my 1
heart 1
than 1
all 1
my 1
other 1
sins 1
the 1
god 1
of 1
heaven 1
forgive 1
me 1
ever 1
since 1
i 1
was 1
condemned 1
my 1
confessor 1
has 1
besieged 1
me 1
he 1
threatened 1
and 1
menaced 1
until 1
i 1
almost 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
monster 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
was 1
he 1
threatened 1
excommunication 1
and 1
hell 1
fire 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
moments 1
if 1
i 1
continued 1
obdurate 1
dear 1
lady 1
i 1
had 1
none 1
to 1
support 1
me 1
all 1
looked 1
on 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
wretch 1
doomed 1
to 1
ignominy 1
and 1
perdition 1
what 1
could 1
i 1
do 1
in 1
an 1
evil 1
hour 1
i 1
subscribed 1
to 1
a 1
lie 1
and 1
now 1
only 1
am 1
i 1
truly 1
miserable 1
she 1
paused 1
weeping 1
and 1
then 1
continued 1
i 1
thought 1
with 1
horror 1
my 1
sweet 1
lady 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
believe 1
your 1
justine 1
whom 1
your 1
blessed 1
aunt 1
had 1
so 1
highly 1
honoured 1
and 1
whom 1
you 1
loved 1
was 1
a 1
creature 1
capable 1
of 1
a 1
crime 1
which 1
none 1
but 1
the 1
devil 1
himself 1
could 1
have 1
perpetrated 1
dear 1
william 1
dearest 1
blessed 1
child 1
i 1
soon 1
shall 1
see 1
you 1
again 1
in 1
heaven 1
where 1
we 1
shall 1
all 1
be 1
happy 1
and 1
that 1
consoles 1
me 1
going 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
suffer 1
ignominy 1
and 1
death 1
oh 1
justine 1
forgive 1
me 1
for 1
having 1
for 1
one 1
moment 1
distrusted 1
you 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
confess 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
mourn 1
dear 1
girl 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
i 1
will 1
proclaim 1
i 1
will 1
prove 1
your 1
innocence 1
i 1
will 1
melt 1
the 1
stony 1
hearts 1
of 1
your 1
enemies 1
by 1
my 1
tears 1
and 1
prayers 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
die 1
you 1
my 1
playfellow 1
my 1
companion 1
my 1
sister 1
perish 1
on 1
the 1
scaffold 1
no 1
no 1
i 1
never 1
could 1
survive 1
so 1
horrible 1
a 1
misfortune 1
justine 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
mournfully 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
to 1
die 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
pang 1
is 1
past 1
god 1
raises 1
my 1
weakness 1
and 1
gives 1
me 1
courage 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
worst 1
i 1
leave 1
a 1
sad 1
and 1
bitter 1
world 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
remember 1
me 1
and 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
as 1
of 1
one 1
unjustly 1
condemned 1
i 1
am 1
resigned 1
to 1
the 1
fate 1
awaiting 1
me 1
learn 1
from 1
me 1
dear 1
lady 1
to 1
submit 1
in 1
patience 1
to 1
the 1
will 1
of 1
heaven 1
during 1
this 1
conversation 1
i 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
a 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
prison 1
room 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
conceal 1
the 1
horrid 1
anguish 1
that 1
possessed 1
me 1
despair 1
who 1
dared 1
talk 1
of 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
victim 1
who 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
was 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
awful 1
boundary 1
between 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
felt 1
not 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
such 1
deep 1
and 1
bitter 1
agony 1
i 1
gnashed 1
my 1
teeth 1
and 1
ground 1
them 1
together 1
uttering 1
a 1
groan 1
that 1
came 1
from 1
my 1
inmost 1
soul 1
justine 1
started 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
she 1
approached 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
dear 1
sir 1
you 1
are 1
very 1
kind 1
to 1
visit 1
me 1
you 1
i 1
hope 1
do 1
not 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
guilty 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
answer 1
no 1
justine 1
said 1
elizabeth 1
he 1
is 1
more 1
convinced 1
of 1
your 1
innocence 1
than 1
i 1
was 1
for 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
confessed 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
credit 1
it 1
i 1
truly 1
thank 1
him 1
in 1
these 1
last 1
moments 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
sincerest 1
gratitude 1
towards 1
those 1
who 1
think 1
of 1
me 1
with 1
kindness 1
how 1
sweet 1
is 1
the 1
affection 1
of 1
others 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
wretch 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
it 1
removes 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
my 1
misfortune 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
die 1
in 1
peace 1
now 1
that 1
my 1
innocence 1
is 1
acknowledged 1
by 1
you 1
dear 1
lady 1
and 1
your 1
cousin 1
thus 1
the 1
poor 1
sufferer 1
tried 1
to 1
comfort 1
others 1
and 1
herself 1
she 1
indeed 1
gained 1
the 1
resignation 1
she 1
desired 1
but 1
i 1
the 1
true 1
murderer 1
felt 1
the 1
never 1
dying 1
worm 1
alive 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
which 1
allowed 1
of 1
no 1
hope 1
or 1
consolation 1
elizabeth 1
also 1
wept 1
and 1
was 1
unhappy 1
but 1
hers 1
also 1
was 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
innocence 1
which 1
like 1
a 1
cloud 1
that 1
passes 1
over 1
the 1
fair 1
moon 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
hides 1
but 1
cannot 1
tarnish 1
its 1
brightness 1
anguish 1
and 1
despair 1
had 1
penetrated 1
into 1
the 1
core 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
bore 1
a 1
hell 1
within 1
me 1
which 1
nothing 1
could 1
extinguish 1
we 1
stayed 1
several 1
hours 1
with 1
justine 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
great 1
difficulty 1
that 1
elizabeth 1
could 1
tear 1
herself 1
away 1
i 1
wish 1
cried 1
she 1
that 1
i 1
were 1
to 1
die 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
cannot 1
live 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
of 1
misery 1
justine 1
assumed 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
while 1
she 1
with 1
difficulty 1
repressed 1
her 1
bitter 1
tears 1
she 1
embraced 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
voice 1
of 1
half 1
suppressed 1
emotion 1
farewell 1
sweet 1
lady 1
dearest 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
beloved 1
and 1
only 1
friend 1
may 1
heaven 1
in 1
its 1
bounty 1
bless 1
and 1
preserve 1
you 1
may 1
this 1
be 1
the 1
last 1
misfortune 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
ever 1
suffer 1
live 1
and 1
be 1
happy 1
and 1
make 1
others 1
so 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
morrow 1
justine 1
died 1
elizabeth 1
s 1
heart 1
rending 1
eloquence 1
failed 1
to 1
move 1
the 1
judges 1
from 1
their 1
settled 1
conviction 1
in 1
the 1
criminality 1
of 1
the 1
saintly 1
sufferer 1
my 1
passionate 1
and 1
indignant 1
appeals 1
were 1
lost 1
upon 1
them 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
received 1
their 1
cold 1
answers 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
harsh 1
unfeeling 1
reasoning 1
of 1
these 1
men 1
my 1
purposed 1
avowal 1
died 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
lips 1
thus 1
i 1
might 1
proclaim 1
myself 1
a 1
madman 1
but 1
not 1
revoke 1
the 1
sentence 1
passed 1
upon 1
my 1
wretched 1
victim 1
she 1
perished 1
on 1
the 1
scaffold 1
as 1
a 1
murderess 1
from 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
i 1
turned 1
to 1
contemplate 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
voiceless 1
grief 1
of 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
this 1
also 1
was 1
my 1
doing 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
woe 1
and 1
the 1
desolation 1
of 1
that 1
late 1
so 1
smiling 1
home 1
all 1
was 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
thrice 1
accursed 1
hands 1
ye 1
weep 1
unhappy 1
ones 1
but 1
these 1
are 1
not 1
your 1
last 1
tears 1
again 1
shall 1
you 1
raise 1
the 1
funeral 1
wail 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
your 1
lamentations 1
shall 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
be 1
heard 1
frankenstein 1
your 1
son 1
your 1
kinsman 1
your 1
early 1
much 1
loved 1
friend 1
he 1
who 1
would 1
spend 1
each 1
vital 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
for 1
your 1
sakes 1
who 1
has 1
no 1
thought 1
nor 1
sense 1
of 1
joy 1
except 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
mirrored 1
also 1
in 1
your 1
dear 1
countenances 1
who 1
would 1
fill 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
blessings 1
and 1
spend 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
serving 1
you 1
he 1
bids 1
you 1
weep 1
to 1
shed 1
countless 1
tears 1
happy 1
beyond 1
his 1
hopes 1
if 1
thus 1
inexorable 1
fate 1

peace 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1

succeeded 1
to 1
your 1
sad 1
torments 1
thus 1
spoke 1
my 1
prophetic 1
soul 1
as 1
torn 1
by 1
remorse 1
horror 1
and 1
despair 1
i 1
beheld 1
those 1
i 1
loved 1

vain 1
sorrow 1
upon 1
the 1
graves 1
of 1

nothing 1

more 1
painful 1

after 1

been 1

alive 1

a 1
weight 1
of 1
despair 1

on 1

from 1

persuaded 1
myself 1
was 1
yet 1
behind 1
yet 1
my 1
heart 1
overflowed 1
with 1
kindness 1
and 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
virtue 1
i 1
had 1
begun 1
life 1
with 1
benevolent 1
intentions 1
and 1
thirsted 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
i 1
should 1
put 1
them 1
in 1
practice 1
and 1
make 1
myself 1
useful 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
now 1
all 1
was 1
blasted 1
instead 1
of 1
that 1
serenity 1
of 1
conscience 1
which 1
allowed 1
me 1
to 1
look 1
back 1
upon 1
the 1
past 1
with 1
self 1
satisfaction 1
and 1
from 1
thence 1
to 1
gather 1
promise 1
of 1
new 1
hopes 1
i 1
was 1
seized 1
by 1
remorse 1
and 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
guilt 1
which 1
hurried 1
me 1
away 1
to 1
a 1
hell 1
of 1
intense 1
tortures 1
such 1
as 1
no 1
language 1
can 1
describe 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
preyed 1
upon 1
my 1
health 1
which 1
had 1
perhaps 1
never 1
entirely 1
recovered 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
shock 1
it 1
had 1
sustained 1
i 1
shunned 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
man 1
all 1
sound 1
of 1
joy 1
or 1
complacency 1
was 1
torture 1
to 1
me 1
solitude 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
consolation 1
deep 1
dark 1
deathlike 1
solitude 1
my 1
father 1
observed 1
with 1
pain 1
the 1
alteration 1
perceptible 1
in 1
my 1
disposition 1
and 1
habits 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
arguments 1
deduced 1
from 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
his 1
serene 1
conscience 1
and 1
guiltless 1
life 1
to 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
fortitude 1
and 1
awaken 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
dispel 1
the 1
dark 1
cloud 1
which 1
brooded 1
over 1
me 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
victor 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
suffer 1
also 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
love 1
a 1
child 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
loved 1
your 1
brother 1
tears 1
came 1
into 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
but 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
a 1
duty 1
to 1
the 1
survivors 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
refrain 1
from 1
augmenting 1
their 1
unhappiness 1
by 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
immoderate 1
grief 1
it 1
is 1
also 1
a 1
duty 1
owed 1
to 1
yourself 1
for 1
excessive 1
sorrow 1
prevents 1
improvement 1
or 1
enjoyment 1
or 1
even 1
the 1
discharge 1
of 1
daily 1
usefulness 1
without 1
which 1
no 1
man 1
is 1
fit 1
for 1
society 1
this 1
advice 1
although 1
good 1
was 1
totally 1
inapplicable 1
to 1
my 1
case 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
hide 1
my 1
grief 1
and 1
console 1
my 1
friends 1
if 1
remorse 1
had 1
not 1
mingled 1
its 1
bitterness 1
and 1
terror 1
its 1
alarm 1
with 1
my 1
other 1
sensations 1
now 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
answer 1
my 1
father 1
with 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
hide 1
myself 1
from 1
his 1
view 1
about 1
this 1
time 1
we 1
retired 1
to 1
our 1
house 1
at 1
belrive 1
this 1
change 1
was 1
particularly 1
agreeable 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
shutting 1
of 1
the 1
gates 1
regularly 1
at 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
and 1
the 1
impossibility 1
of 1
remaining 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
after 1
that 1
hour 1
had 1
rendered 1
our 1
residence 1
within 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
geneva 1
very 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
free 1
often 1
after 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
had 1
retired 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
passed 1
many 1
hours 1
upon 1
the 1
water 1
sometimes 1
with 1
my 1
sails 1
set 1
i 1
was 1
carried 1
by 1
the 1
wind 1
and 1
sometimes 1
after 1
rowing 1
into 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
boat 1
to 1
pursue 1
its 1
own 1
course 1
and 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
miserable 1
reflections 1
i 1
was 1
often 1
tempted 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
at 1
peace 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
the 1
only 1
unquiet 1
thing 1
that 1
wandered 1
restless 1
in 1
a 1
scene 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
heavenly 1
if 1
i 1
except 1
some 1
bat 1
or 1
the 1
frogs 1
whose 1
harsh 1
and 1
interrupted 1
croaking 1
was 1
heard 1
only 1
when 1
i 1
approached 1
the 1
shore 1
often 1
i 1
say 1
i 1
was 1
tempted 1
to 1
plunge 1
into 1
the 1
silent 1
lake 1
that 1
the 1
waters 1
might 1
close 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
calamities 1
forever 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
restrained 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
heroic 1
and 1
suffering 1
elizabeth 1
whom 1
i 1
tenderly 1
loved 1
and 1
whose 1
existence 1
was 1
bound 1
up 1
in 1
mine 1
i 1
thought 1
also 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
surviving 1
brother 1
should 1
i 1
by 1
my 1
base 1
desertion 1
leave 1
them 1
exposed 1
and 1
unprotected 1
to 1
the 1
malice 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
let 1
loose 1
among 1
them 1
at 1
these 1
moments 1
i 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
and 1
wished 1
that 1
peace 1
would 1
revisit 1
my 1
mind 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
afford 1
them 1
consolation 1
and 1
happiness 1
but 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
remorse 1
extinguished 1
every 1
hope 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
unalterable 1
evils 1
and 1
i 1
lived 1
in 1
daily 1
fear 1
lest 1
the 1
monster 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
should 1
perpetrate 1
some 1
new 1
wickedness 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
obscure 1
feeling 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
not 1
over 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
still 1
commit 1
some 1
signal 1
crime 1
which 1
by 1
its 1
enormity 1
should 1
almost 1
efface 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
there 1
was 1
always 1
scope 1
for 1
fear 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
anything 1
i 1
loved 1
remained 1
behind 1
my 1
abhorrence 1
of 1
this 1
fiend 1
cannot 1
be 1
conceived 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
him 1
i 1
gnashed 1
my 1
teeth 1
my 1
eyes 1
became 1
inflamed 1
and 1
i 1
ardently 1
wished 1
to 1
extinguish 1
that 1
life 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
thoughtlessly 1
bestowed 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
his 1
crimes 1
and 1
malice 1
my 1
hatred 1
and 1
revenge 1
burst 1
all 1
bounds 1
of 1
moderation 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
pilgrimage 1
to 1
the 1
highest 1
peak 1
of 1
the 1
andes 1
could 1
i 1
when 1
there 1
have 1
precipitated 1
him 1
to 1
their 1
base 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
wreak 1
the 1
utmost 1
extent 1
of 1
abhorrence 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
avenge 1
the 1
deaths 1
of 1
william 1
and 1
justine 1
our 1
house 1
was 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
mourning 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
health 1
was 1
deeply 1
shaken 1
by 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
the 1
recent 1
events 1
elizabeth 1
was 1
sad 1
and 1
desponding 1
she 1
no 1
longer 1
took 1
delight 1
in 1
her 1
ordinary 1
occupations 1
all 1
pleasure 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
sacrilege 1
toward 1
the 1
dead 1
eternal 1
woe 1
and 1
tears 1
she 1
then 1
thought 1
was 1
the 1
just 1
tribute 1
she 1
should 1
pay 1
to 1
innocence 1
so 1
blasted 1
and 1
destroyed 1
she 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
that 1
happy 1
creature 1
who 1
in 1
earlier 1
youth 1
wandered 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
ecstasy 1
of 1
our 1
future 1
prospects 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
those 1
sorrows 1
which 1
are 1
sent 1
to 1
wean 1
us 1
from 1
the 1
earth 1
had 1
visited 1
her 1
and 1
its 1
dimming 1
influence 1
quenched 1
her 1
dearest 1
smiles 1
when 1
i 1
reflect 1
my 1
dear 1
cousin 1
said 1
she 1
on 1
the 1
miserable 1
death 1
of 1
justine 1
moritz 1
i 1
no 1
longer 1
see 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
its 1
works 1
as 1
they 1
before 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
before 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
accounts 1
of 1
vice 1
and 1
injustice 1
that 1
i 1
read 1
in 1
books 1
or 1
heard 1
from 1
others 1
as 1
tales 1
of 1
ancient 1
days 1
or 1
imaginary 1
evils 1
at 1
least 1
they 1
were 1
remote 1
and 1
more 1
familiar 1
to 1
reason 1
than 1
to 1
the 1
imagination 1
but 1
now 1
misery 1
has 1
come 1
home 1
and 1
men 1
appear 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
monsters 1
thirsting 1
for 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
blood 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
certainly 1
unjust 1
everybody 1
believed 1
that 1
poor 1
girl 1
to 1
be 1
guilty 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
committed 1
the 1
crime 1
for 1
which 1
she 1
suffered 1
assuredly 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
most 1
depraved 1
of 1
human 1
creatures 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
jewels 1
to 1
have 1
murdered 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
her 1
benefactor 1
and 1
friend 1
a 1
child 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
nursed 1
from 1
its 1
birth 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
love 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
her 1
own 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
consent 1
to 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
any 1
human 1
being 1
but 1
certainly 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
such 1
a 1
creature 1
unfit 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
men 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
innocent 1
i 1
know 1
i 1
feel 1
she 1
was 1
innocent 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
opinion 1
and 1
that 1
confirms 1
me 1
alas 1
victor 1
when 1
falsehood 1
can 1
look 1
so 1
like 1
the 1
truth 1
who 1
can 1
assure 1
themselves 1
of 1
certain 1
happiness 1
i 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
walking 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
a 1
precipice 1
towards 1
which 1
thousands 1
are 1
crowding 1
and 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
plunge 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
abyss 1
william 1
and 1
justine 1
were 1
assassinated 1
and 1
the 1
murderer 1
escapes 1
he 1
walks 1
about 1
the 1
world 1
free 1
and 1
perhaps 1
respected 1
but 1
even 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
condemned 1
to 1
suffer 1
on 1
the 1
scaffold 1
for 1
the 1
same 1
crimes 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
change 1
places 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
wretch 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
this 1
discourse 1
with 1
the 1
extremest 1
agony 1
i 1
not 1
in 1
deed 1
but 1
in 1
effect 1
was 1
the 1
true 1
murderer 1
elizabeth 1
read 1
my 1
anguish 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
and 1
kindly 1
taking 1
my 1
hand 1
said 1
my 1
dearest 1
friend 1
you 1
must 1
calm 1
yourself 1
these 1
events 1
have 1
affected 1
me 1
god 1
knows 1
how 1
deeply 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
so 1
wretched 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
sometimes 1
of 1
revenge 1
in 1
your 1
countenance 1
that 1
makes 1
me 1
tremble 1
dear 1
victor 1
banish 1
these 1
dark 1
passions 1
remember 1
the 1
friends 1
around 1
you 1
who 1
centre 1
all 1
their 1
hopes 1
in 1
you 1
have 1
we 1
lost 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
rendering 1
you 1
happy 1
ah 1
while 1
we 1
love 1
while 1
we 1
are 1
true 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
here 1
in 1
this 1
land 1
of 1
peace 1

your 1
native 1

we 1
may 1
reap 1
every 1
tranquil 1
blessing 1
what 1
can 1
disturb 1
our 1
peace 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
such 1
words 1
from 1
her 1
whom 1
i 1
fondly 1
prized 1
before 1
every 1
other 1

away 1
the 1
fiend 1
that 1
lurked 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
even 1
as 1
she 1
spoke 1
i 1
drew 1
near 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
terror 1
lest 1
at 1
that 1
very 1
moment 1
the 1
destroyer 1
had 1
been 1
near 1
to 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
her 1
thus 1
not 1
the 1
tenderness 1
of 1
friendship 1
nor 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
earth 1
nor 1
of 1
heaven 1
could 1
redeem 1
my 1
soul 1
from 1
woe 1
the 1
very 1
accents 1
of 1
love 1
were 1
ineffectual 1
i 1
was 1
encompassed 1
by 1
a 1
cloud 1
which 1
no 1
beneficial 1
influence 1
could 1
penetrate 1
the 1
wounded 1
deer 1
dragging 1
its 1
fainting 1
limbs 1
to 1
some 1
untrodden 1
brake 1
there 1
to 1
gaze 1
upon 1
the 1
arrow 1
which 1
had 1
pierced 1
it 1
and 1
to 1
die 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
type 1
of 1
me 1
sometimes 1
i 1
could 1
cope 1
with 1
the 1
sullen 1
despair 1
that 1
overwhelmed 1
me 1
but 1
sometimes 1
the 1
whirlwind 1
passions 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
drove 1
me 1
to 1
seek 1
by 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
and 1
by 1
change 1
of 1
place 1
some 1
relief 1
from 1
my 1
intolerable 1
sensations 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
an 1
access 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
that 1
i 1
suddenly 1
left 1
my 1
home 1
and 1
bending 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
near 1
alpine 1
valleys 1
sought 1
in 1
the 1
magnificence 1
the 1
eternity 1
of 1
such 1
scenes 1
to 1
forget 1
myself 1
and 1
my 1
ephemeral 1
because 1
human 1
sorrows 1
my 1
wanderings 1
were 1
directed 1
towards 1
the 1
valley 1
of 1
chamounix 1
i 1
had 1
visited 1
it 1
frequently 1
during 1
my 1
boyhood 1
six 1
years 1
had 1
passed 1
since 1
then 1
_i_ 1
was 1
a 1
wreck 1
but 1
nought 1
had 1
changed 1
in 1
those 1
savage 1
and 1
enduring 1
scenes 1
i 1
performed 1
the 1
first 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
on 1
horseback 1
i 1
afterwards 1
hired 1
a 1
mule 1
as 1
the 1
more 1
sure 1
footed 1
and 1
least 1
liable 1
to 1
receive 1
injury 1
on 1
these 1
rugged 1
roads 1
the 1
weather 1
was 1
fine 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
august 1
nearly 1
two 1
months 1
after 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
justine 1
that 1
miserable 1
epoch 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
dated 1
all 1
my 1
woe 1
the 1
weight 1
upon 1
my 1
spirit 1
was 1
sensibly 1
lightened 1
as 1
i 1
plunged 1
yet 1
deeper 1
in 1
the 1
ravine 1
of 1
arve 1
the 1
immense 1
mountains 1
and 1
precipices 1
that 1
overhung 1
me 1
on 1
every 1
side 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
raging 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
and 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
waterfalls 1
around 1
spoke 1
of 1
a 1
power 1
mighty 1
as 1
omnipotence 1
and 1
i 1
ceased 1
to 1
fear 1
or 1
to 1
bend 1
before 1
any 1
being 1
less 1
almighty 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
had 1
created 1
and 1
ruled 1
the 1
elements 1
here 1
displayed 1
in 1
their 1
most 1
terrific 1
guise 1
still 1
as 1
i 1
ascended 1
higher 1
the 1
valley 1
assumed 1
a 1
more 1
magnificent 1
and 1
astonishing 1
character 1
ruined 1
castles 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
precipices 1
of 1
piny 1
mountains 1
the 1
impetuous 1
arve 1
and 1
cottages 1
every 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
peeping 1
forth 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
formed 1
a 1
scene 1
of 1
singular 1
beauty 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
augmented 1
and 1
rendered 1
sublime 1
by 1
the 1
mighty 1
alps 1
whose 1
white 1
and 1
shining 1
pyramids 1
and 1
domes 1
towered 1
above 1
all 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
another 1
earth 1
the 1
habitations 1
of 1
another 1
race 1
of 1
beings 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
bridge 1
of 1
pelissier 1
where 1
the 1
ravine 1
which 1
the 1
river 1
forms 1
opened 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
ascend 1
the 1
mountain 1
that 1
overhangs 1
it 1
soon 1
after 1
i 1
entered 1
the 1
valley 1
of 1
chamounix 1
this 1
valley 1
is 1
more 1
wonderful 1
and 1
sublime 1
but 1
not 1
so 1
beautiful 1
and 1
picturesque 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
servox 1
through 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
passed 1
the 1
high 1
and 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
were 1
its 1
immediate 1
boundaries 1
but 1
i 1
saw 1
no 1
more 1
ruined 1
castles 1
and 1
fertile 1
fields 1
immense 1
glaciers 1
approached 1
the 1
road 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
rumbling 1
thunder 1
of 1
the 1
falling 1
avalanche 1
and 1
marked 1
the 1
smoke 1
of 1
its 1
passage 1
mont 1
blanc 1
the 1
supreme 1
and 1
magnificent 1
mont 1
blanc 1
raised 1
itself 1
from 1
the 1
surrounding 1
aiguilles 1
and 1
its 1
tremendous 1
dome 1
overlooked 1
the 1
valley 1
a 1
tingling 1
long 1
lost 1
sense 1
of 1
pleasure 1
often 1
came 1
across 1
me 1
during 1
this 1
journey 1
some 1
turn 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
some 1
new 1
object 1
suddenly 1
perceived 1
and 1
recognized 1
reminded 1
me 1
of 1
days 1
gone 1
by 1
and 1
were 1
associated 1
with 1
the 1
lighthearted 1
gaiety 1
of 1
boyhood 1
the 1
very 1
winds 1
whispered 1
in 1
soothing 1
accents 1
and 1
maternal 1
nature 1
bade 1
me 1
weep 1
no 1
more 1
then 1
again 1
the 1
kindly 1
influence 1
ceased 1
to 1
act 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
fettered 1
again 1
to 1
grief 1
and 1
indulging 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
reflection 1
then 1
i 1
spurred 1
on 1
my 1
animal 1
striving 1
so 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
world 1
my 1
fears 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
myself 1
or 1
in 1
a 1
more 1
desperate 1
fashion 1
i 1
alighted 1
and 1
threw 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
weighed 1
down 1
by 1
horror 1
and 1
despair 1
at 1
length 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
chamounix 1
exhaustion 1
succeeded 1
to 1
the 1
extreme 1
fatigue 1
both 1
of 1
body 1
and 1
of 1
mind 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
endured 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
space 1
of 1
time 1
i 1
remained 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
watching 1
the 1
pallid 1
lightnings 1
that 1
played 1
above 1
mont 1
blanc 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
rushing 1
of 1
the 1
arve 1
which 1
pursued 1
its 1
noisy 1
way 1
beneath 1
the 1
same 1
lulling 1
sounds 1
acted 1
as 1
a 1
lullaby 1
to 1
my 1
too 1
keen 1
sensations 1
when 1
i 1
placed 1
my 1
head 1
upon 1
my 1
pillow 1
sleep 1
crept 1
over 1
me 1
i 1
felt 1
it 1
as 1
it 1
came 1
and 1
blessed 1
the 1
giver 1
of 1
oblivion 1
chapter 1
10 1
i 1
spent 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
roaming 1
through 1
the 1
valley 1
i 1
stood 1
beside 1
the 1
sources 1
of 1
the 1
arveiron 1
which 1
take 1
their 1
rise 1
in 1
a 1
glacier 1
that 1
with 1
slow 1
pace 1
is 1
advancing 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
to 1
barricade 1
the 1
valley 1
the 1
abrupt 1
sides 1
of 1
vast 1
mountains 1
were 1
before 1
me 1
the 1
icy 1
wall 1
of 1
the 1
glacier 1
overhung 1
me 1
a 1
few 1
shattered 1
pines 1
were 1
scattered 1
around 1
and 1
the 1
solemn 1
silence 1
of 1
this 1
glorious 1
presence 1
chamber 1
of 1
imperial 1
nature 1
was 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
brawling 1
waves 1
or 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
some 1
vast 1
fragment 1
the 1
thunder 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
avalanche 1
or 1
the 1
cracking 1
reverberated 1
along 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
the 1
accumulated 1
ice 1
which 1
through 1
the 1
silent 1
working 1
of 1
immutable 1
laws 1
was 1
ever 1
and 1
anon 1
rent 1
and 1
torn 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
a 1
plaything 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
these 1
sublime 1
and 1
magnificent 1
scenes 1
afforded 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
consolation 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
receiving 1
they 1
elevated 1
me 1
from 1
all 1
littleness 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
although 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
remove 1
my 1
grief 1
they 1
subdued 1
and 1
tranquillized 1
it 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
also 1
they 1
diverted 1
my 1
mind 1
from 1
the 1
thoughts 1
over 1
which 1
it 1
had 1
brooded 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
month 1
i 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
at 1
night 1
my 1
slumbers 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
waited 1
on 1
and 1
ministered 1
to 1
by 1
the 1
assemblance 1
of 1
grand 1
shapes 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
contemplated 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
they 1
congregated 1
round 1
me 1
the 1
unstained 1
snowy 1
mountain 1
top 1
the 1
glittering 1
pinnacle 1
the 1
pine 1
woods 1
and 1
ragged 1
bare 1
ravine 1
the 1
eagle 1
soaring 1
amidst 1
the 1
clouds 1
they 1
all 1
gathered 1
round 1
me 1
and 1
bade 1
me 1
be 1
at 1
peace 1
where 1
had 1
they 1
fled 1
when 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
i 1
awoke 1
all 1
of 1
soul 1
inspiriting 1
fled 1
with 1
sleep 1
and 1
dark 1
melancholy 1
clouded 1
every 1
thought 1
the 1
rain 1
was 1
pouring 1
in 1
torrents 1
and 1
thick 1
mists 1
hid 1
the 1
summits 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
even 1
saw 1
not 1
the 1
faces 1
of 1
those 1
mighty 1
friends 1
still 1
i 1
would 1
penetrate 1
their 1
misty 1
veil 1
and 1
seek 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
cloudy 1
retreats 1
what 1
were 1
rain 1
and 1
storm 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
mule 1
was 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
ascend 1
to 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
montanvert 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
tremendous 1
and 1
ever 1
moving 1
glacier 1
had 1
produced 1
upon 1
my 1
mind 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
it 1
it 1
had 1
then 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sublime 1
ecstasy 1
that 1
gave 1
wings 1
to 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
allowed 1
it 1
to 1
soar 1
from 1
the 1
obscure 1
world 1
to 1
light 1
and 1
joy 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
awful 1
and 1
majestic 1
in 1
nature 1
had 1
indeed 1
always 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
solemnizing 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
causing 1
me 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
passing 1
cares 1
of 1
life 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
go 1
without 1
a 1
guide 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
well 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
path 1
and 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
another 1
would 1
destroy 1
the 1
solitary 1
grandeur 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
the 1
ascent 1
is 1
precipitous 1
but 1
the 1
path 1
is 1
cut 1
into 1
continual 1
and 1
short 1
windings 1
which 1
enable 1
you 1
to 1
surmount 1
the 1
perpendicularity 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
scene 1
terrifically 1
desolate 1
in 1
a 1
thousand 1
spots 1
the 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
winter 1
avalanche 1
may 1
be 1
perceived 1
where 1
trees 1
lie 1
broken 1
and 1
strewed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
some 1
entirely 1
destroyed 1
others 1
bent 1
leaning 1
upon 1
the 1
jutting 1
rocks 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
or 1
transversely 1
upon 1
other 1
trees 1
the 1
path 1
as 1
you 1
ascend 1
higher 1
is 1
intersected 1
by 1
ravines 1
of 1
snow 1
down 1
which 1
stones 1
continually 1
roll 1
from 1
above 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
is 1
particularly 1
dangerous 1
as 1
the 1
slightest 1
sound 1
such 1
as 1
even 1
speaking 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
produces 1
a 1
concussion 1
of 1
air 1
sufficient 1
to 1
draw 1
destruction 1
upon 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
speaker 1
the 1
pines 1
are 1
not 1
tall 1
or 1
luxuriant 1
but 1
they 1
are 1
sombre 1
and 1
add 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
severity 1
to 1
the 1
scene 1
i 1
looked 1
on 1
the 1
valley 1
beneath 1
vast 1
mists 1
were 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
rivers 1
which 1
ran 1
through 1
it 1
and 1
curling 1
in 1
thick 1
wreaths 1
around 1
the 1
opposite 1
mountains 1
whose 1
summits 1
were 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
uniform 1
clouds 1
while 1
rain 1
poured 1
from 1
the 1
dark 1
sky 1
and 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
melancholy 1
impression 1
i 1
received 1
from 1
the 1
objects 1
around 1
me 1
alas 1
why 1
does 1
man 1
boast 1
of 1
sensibilities 1
superior 1
to 1
those 1
apparent 1
in 1
the 1
brute 1
it 1
only 1
renders 1
them 1
more 1
necessary 1
beings 1
if 1
our 1
impulses 1
were 1
confined 1
to 1
hunger 1
thirst 1
and 1
desire 1
we 1
might 1
be 1
nearly 1
free 1
but 1
now 1
we 1
are 1
moved 1
by 1
every 1
wind 1
that 1
blows 1
and 1
a 1
chance 1
word 1
or 1
scene 1
that 1
that 1
word 1
may 1
convey 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
rest 1
a 1
dream 1
has 1
power 1
to 1
poison 1
sleep 1
we 1
rise 1
one 1
wand 1
ring 1

pollutes 1
the 1
day 1

the 1

his 1

nought 1
may 1
endure 1
but 1
mutability 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
noon 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
ascent 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
i 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
rock 1
that 1
overlooks 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
a 1
mist 1
covered 1
both 1
that 1
and 1
the 1
surrounding 1
mountains 1
presently 1
a 1
breeze 1
dissipated 1
the 1
cloud 1
and 1
i 1
descended 1
upon 1
the 1
glacier 1
the 1
surface 1
is 1
very 1
uneven 1
rising 1
like 1
the 1
waves 1
of 1
a 1
troubled 1
sea 1
descending 1
low 1
and 1
interspersed 1
by 1
rifts 1
that 1
sink 1
deep 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
ice 1
is 1
almost 1
a 1
league 1
in 1
width 1
but 1
i 1
spent 1
nearly 1
two 1
hours 1
in 1
crossing 1
it 1
the 1
opposite 1
mountain 1
is 1
a 1
bare 1
perpendicular 1
rock 1
from 1
the 1
side 1
where 1
i 1
now 1
stood 1
montanvert 1
was 1
exactly 1
opposite 1
at 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
a 1
league 1
and 1
above 1
it 1
rose 1
mont 1
blanc 1
in 1
awful 1
majesty 1
i 1
remained 1
in 1
a 1
recess 1
of 1
the 1
rock 1
gazing 1
on 1
this 1
wonderful 1
and 1
stupendous 1
scene 1
the 1
sea 1
or 1
rather 1
the 1
vast 1
river 1
of 1
ice 1
wound 1
among 1
its 1
dependent 1
mountains 1
whose 1
aerial 1
summits 1
hung 1
over 1
its 1
recesses 1
their 1
icy 1
and 1
glittering 1
peaks 1
shone 1
in 1
the 1
sunlight 1
over 1
the 1
clouds 1
my 1
heart 1
which 1
was 1
before 1
sorrowful 1
now 1
swelled 1
with 1
something 1
like 1
joy 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
wandering 1
spirits 1
if 1
indeed 1
ye 1
wander 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
rest 1
in 1
your 1
narrow 1
beds 1
allow 1
me 1
this 1
faint 1
happiness 1
or 1
take 1
me 1
as 1
your 1
companion 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
joys 1
of 1
life 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
this 1
i 1
suddenly 1
beheld 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
at 1
some 1
distance 1
advancing 1
towards 1
me 1
with 1
superhuman 1
speed 1
he 1
bounded 1
over 1
the 1
crevices 1
in 1
the 1
ice 1
among 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
walked 1
with 1
caution 1
his 1
stature 1
also 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
seemed 1
to 1
exceed 1
that 1
of 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
troubled 1
a 1
mist 1
came 1
over 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
faintness 1
seize 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
quickly 1
restored 1
by 1
the 1
cold 1
gale 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
i 1
perceived 1
as 1
the 1
shape 1
came 1
nearer 1
sight 1
tremendous 1
and 1
abhorred 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
i 1
trembled 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
horror 1
resolving 1
to 1
wait 1
his 1
approach 1
and 1
then 1
close 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
mortal 1
combat 1
he 1
approached 1
his 1
countenance 1
bespoke 1
bitter 1
anguish 1
combined 1
with 1
disdain 1
and 1
malignity 1
while 1
its 1
unearthly 1
ugliness 1
rendered 1
it 1
almost 1
too 1
horrible 1
for 1
human 1
eyes 1
but 1
i 1
scarcely 1
observed 1
this 1
rage 1
and 1
hatred 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
deprived 1
me 1
of 1
utterance 1
and 1
i 1
recovered 1
only 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
him 1
with 1
words 1
expressive 1
of 1
furious 1
detestation 1
and 1
contempt 1
devil 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
do 1
you 1
dare 1
approach 1
me 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
you 1
fear 1
the 1
fierce 1
vengeance 1
of 1
my 1
arm 1
wreaked 1
on 1
your 1
miserable 1
head 1
begone 1
vile 1
insect 1
or 1
rather 1
stay 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
trample 1
you 1
to 1
dust 1
and 1
oh 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
with 1
the 1
extinction 1
of 1
your 1
miserable 1
existence 1
restore 1
those 1
victims 1
whom 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
diabolically 1
murdered 1
i 1
expected 1
this 1
reception 1
said 1
the 1
daemon 1
all 1
men 1
hate 1
the 1
wretched 1
how 1
then 1
must 1
i 1
be 1
hated 1
who 1
am 1
miserable 1
beyond 1
all 1
living 1
things 1
yet 1
you 1
my 1
creator 1
detest 1
and 1
spurn 1
me 1
thy 1
creature 1
to 1
whom 1
thou 1
art 1
bound 1
by 1
ties 1
only 1
dissoluble 1
by 1
the 1
annihilation 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
you 1
purpose 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
how 1
dare 1
you 1
sport 1
thus 1
with 1
life 1
do 1
your 1
duty 1
towards 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
mine 1
towards 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
mankind 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
comply 1
with 1
my 1
conditions 1
i 1
will 1
leave 1
them 1
and 1
you 1
at 1
peace 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
refuse 1
i 1
will 1
glut 1
the 1
maw 1
of 1
death 1
until 1
it 1
be 1
satiated 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
your 1
remaining 1
friends 1
abhorred 1
monster 1
fiend 1
that 1
thou 1
art 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
hell 1
are 1
too 1
mild 1
a 1
vengeance 1
for 1
thy 1
crimes 1
wretched 1
devil 1
you 1
reproach 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
creation 1
come 1
on 1
then 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
extinguish 1
the 1
spark 1
which 1
i 1
so 1
negligently 1
bestowed 1
my 1
rage 1
was 1
without 1
bounds 1
i 1
sprang 1
on 1
him 1
impelled 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
feelings 1
which 1
can 1
arm 1
one 1
being 1
against 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
another 1
he 1
easily 1
eluded 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
be 1
calm 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
to 1
hear 1
me 1
before 1
you 1
give 1
vent 1
to 1
your 1
hatred 1
on 1
my 1
devoted 1
head 1
have 1
i 1
not 1
suffered 1
enough 1
that 1
you 1
seek 1
to 1
increase 1
my 1
misery 1
life 1
although 1
it 1
may 1
only 1
be 1
an 1
accumulation 1
of 1
anguish 1
is 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
defend 1
it 1
remember 1
thou 1
hast 1
made 1
me 1
more 1
powerful 1
than 1
thyself 1
my 1
height 1
is 1
superior 1
to 1
thine 1
my 1
joints 1
more 1
supple 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
tempted 1
to 1
set 1
myself 1
in 1
opposition 1
to 1
thee 1
i 1
am 1
thy 1
creature 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
even 1
mild 1
and 1
docile 1
to 1
my 1
natural 1
lord 1
and 1
king 1
if 1
thou 1
wilt 1
also 1
perform 1
thy 1
part 1
the 1
which 1
thou 1
owest 1
me 1
oh 1
frankenstein 1
be 1
not 1
equitable 1
to 1
every 1
other 1
and 1
trample 1
upon 1
me 1
alone 1
to 1
whom 1
thy 1
justice 1
and 1
even 1
thy 1
clemency 1
and 1
affection 1
is 1
most 1
due 1
remember 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
thy 1
creature 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
thy 1
adam 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
rather 1
the 1
fallen 1
angel 1
whom 1
thou 1
drivest 1
from 1
joy 1
for 1
no 1
misdeed 1
everywhere 1
i 1
see 1
bliss 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
alone 1
am 1
irrevocably 1
excluded 1

me 1
a 1
fiend 1

me 1
happy 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
again 1
be 1
virtuous 1
begone 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
hear 1
you 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
community 1
between 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
we 1
are 1
enemies 1
begone 1
or 1
let 1
us 1
try 1
our 1
strength 1
in 1
a 1
fight 1
in 1
which 1
one 1
must 1
fall 1
how 1

i 1
move 1
thee 1

no 1
entreaties 1
cause 1
thee 1
to 1
turn 1
a 1
favourable 1
eye 1
upon 1

implores 1
thy 1
goodness 1
and 1
compassion 1

me 1
frankenstein 1
i 1
was 1
benevolent 1
my 1
soul 1
glowed 1
with 1
love 1
and 1
humanity 1
but 1
am 1
i 1
not 1
alone 1
miserably 1
alone 1
you 1
my 1
creator 1
abhor 1
me 1
what 1
hope 1
can 1
i 1
gather 1
from 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
who 1
owe 1
me 1
nothing 1
they 1
spurn 1
and 1
hate 1
me 1
the 1
desert 1
mountains 1
and 1
dreary 1
glaciers 1
are 1
my 1
refuge 1
i 1
have 1
wandered 1
here 1
many 1
days 1
the 1
caves 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
i 1
only 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
are 1
a 1
dwelling 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
which 1
man 1
does 1
not 1
grudge 1
these 1
bleak 1
skies 1
i 1
hail 1
for 1
they 1
are 1
kinder 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
your 1
fellow 1
beings 1
if 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
mankind 1
knew 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
they 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
do 1
and 1
arm 1
themselves 1
for 1
my 1
destruction 1
shall 1
i 1
not 1
then 1
hate 1
them 1
who 1
abhor 1
me 1
i 1
will 1
keep 1
no 1
terms 1
with 1
my 1
enemies 1
i 1
am 1
miserable 1
and 1
they 1
shall 1
share 1
my 1
wretchedness 1
yet 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
power 1
to 1
recompense 1
me 1
and 1
deliver 1
them 1
from 1
an 1
evil 1
which 1
it 1
only 1
remains 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
make 1
so 1
great 1
that 1
not 1
only 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
family 1
but 1
thousands 1
of 1
others 1
shall 1
be 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
whirlwinds 1
of 1
its 1
rage 1
let 1
your 1
compassion 1
be 1
moved 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
disdain 1
me 1
listen 1
to 1
my 1
tale 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
that 1
abandon 1
or 1
commiserate 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
shall 1
judge 1
that 1
i 1
deserve 1
but 1
hear 1
me 1
the 1
guilty 1
are 1
allowed 1
by 1
human 1
laws 1
bloody 1
as 1

in 1
their 1
own 1
defence 1
before 1
they 1
are 1
condemned 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
frankenstein 1
you 1
accuse 1
me 1
of 1
murder 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
would 1
with 1
a 1
satisfied 1
conscience 1
destroy 1
your 1
own 1
creature 1
oh 1
praise 1
the 1
eternal 1
justice 1
of 1
man 1

you 1
not 1
to 1
spare 1
me 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
destroy 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
your 1
hands 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
call 1
to 1
my 1
remembrance 1
i 1
rejoined 1
circumstances 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
shudder 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
miserable 1
origin 1
and 1
author 1
cursed 1
be 1
the 1
day 1
abhorred 1
devil 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
first 1
saw 1
light 1
cursed 1
although 1
i 1
curse 1
myself 1
be 1
the 1
hands 1
that 1
formed 1
you 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
wretched 1
beyond 1
expression 1
you 1
have 1
left 1
me 1
no 1
power 1
to 1
consider 1
whether 1
i 1
am 1
just 1
to 1
you 1
or 1
not 1
begone 1
relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
your 1
detested 1
form 1
thus 1
i 1
relieve 1
thee 1
my 1
creator 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
placed 1
his 1
hated 1
hands 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
i 1
flung 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
violence 1
thus 1
i 1
take 1
from 1
thee 1
a 1
sight 1
which 1
you 1
abhor 1
still 1
thou 1
canst 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
grant 1
me 1
thy 1
compassion 1
by 1
the 1
virtues 1
that 1
i 1
once 1
possessed 1
i 1
demand 1
this 1
from 1
you 1
hear 1
my 1
tale 1
it 1
is 1
long 1
and 1
strange 1
and 1
the 1
temperature 1
of 1
this 1
place 1
is 1
not 1
fitting 1
to 1
your 1
fine 1
sensations 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
hut 1
upon 1
the 1
mountain 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
yet 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
before 1
it 1
descends 1
to 1
hide 1
itself 1
behind 1
your 1
snowy 1
precipices 1
and 1
illuminate 1
another 1
world 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
heard 1
my 1
story 1
and 1
can 1
decide 1
on 1
you 1
it 1
rests 1
whether 1
i 1
quit 1
forever 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
lead 1
a 1
harmless 1
life 1
or 1
become 1
the 1
scourge 1
of 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
and 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
speedy 1
ruin 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
he 1
led 1
the 1
way 1
across 1
the 1
ice 1
i 1
followed 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
full 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
answer 1
him 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
proceeded 1
i 1
weighed 1
the 1
various 1
arguments 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
and 1
determined 1
at 1
least 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
his 1
tale 1
i 1
was 1
partly 1
urged 1
by 1
curiosity 1
and 1
compassion 1
confirmed 1
my 1
resolution 1
i 1
had 1
hitherto 1
supposed 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
i 1
eagerly 1
sought 1
a 1
confirmation 1
or 1
denial 1
of 1
this 1
opinion 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
also 1
i 1
felt 1
what 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
a 1
creator 1
towards 1
his 1
creature 1
were 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
render 1
him 1
happy 1
before 1
i 1
complained 1
of 1
his 1
wickedness 1
these 1
motives 1
urged 1
me 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
demand 1
we 1
crossed 1
the 1
ice 1
therefore 1
and 1
ascended 1
the 1
opposite 1
rock 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
again 1
began 1
to 1
descend 1
we 1
entered 1
the 1
hut 1
the 1
fiend 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
exultation 1
i 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
heart 1
and 1
depressed 1
spirits 1
but 1
i 1
consented 1
to 1
listen 1
and 1
seating 1
myself 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
which 1
my 1
odious 1
companion 1
had 1
lighted 1
he 1
thus 1
began 1
his 1
tale 1
chapter 1
11 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
considerable 1
difficulty 1
that 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
original 1
era 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
all 1
the 1
events 1
of 1
that 1
period 1
appear 1
confused 1
and 1
indistinct 1
a 1
strange 1
multiplicity 1
of 1
sensations 1
seized 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
felt 1
heard 1
and 1
smelt 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
before 1
i 1
learned 1
to 1
distinguish 1
between 1
the 1
operations 1
of 1
my 1
various 1
senses 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
remember 1
a 1
stronger 1
light 1
pressed 1
upon 1
my 1
nerves 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
shut 1
my 1
eyes 1
darkness 1
then 1
came 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
troubled 1
me 1
but 1
hardly 1
had 1
i 1
felt 1
this 1
when 1
by 1
opening 1
my 1
eyes 1
as 1
i 1
now 1
suppose 1
the 1
light 1
poured 1
in 1
upon 1
me 1
again 1
i 1
walked 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
descended 1
but 1
i 1
presently 1
found 1
a 1
great 1
alteration 1
in 1
my 1
sensations 1
before 1
dark 1
and 1
opaque 1
bodies 1
had 1
surrounded 1
me 1
impervious 1
to 1
my 1
touch 1
or 1
sight 1
but 1
i 1
now 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
wander 1
on 1
at 1
liberty 1
with 1
no 1
obstacles 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
either 1
surmount 1
or 1
avoid 1
the 1
light 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
oppressive 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
heat 1
wearying 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
walked 1
i 1
sought 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
receive 1
shade 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
forest 1
near 1
ingolstadt 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
lay 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
brook 1
resting 1
from 1
my 1
fatigue 1
until 1
i 1
felt 1
tormented 1
by 1
hunger 1
and 1
thirst 1
this 1
roused 1
me 1
from 1
my 1
nearly 1
dormant 1
state 1
and 1
i 1
ate 1
some 1
berries 1
which 1
i 1
found 1
hanging 1
on 1
the 1
trees 1
or 1
lying 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
slaked 1
my 1
thirst 1
at 1
the 1
brook 1
and 1
then 1
lying 1
down 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
sleep 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
i 1
felt 1
cold 1
also 1
and 1
half 1
frightened 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
instinctively 1
finding 1
myself 1
so 1
desolate 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
quitted 1
your 1
apartment 1
on 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
cold 1
i 1
had 1
covered 1
myself 1
with 1
some 1
clothes 1
but 1
these 1
were 1
insufficient 1
to 1
secure 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
dews 1
of 1
night 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
helpless 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
i 1
knew 1
and 1
could 1
distinguish 1
nothing 1
but 1
feeling 1
pain 1
invade 1
me 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
i 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
wept 1
soon 1
a 1
gentle 1
light 1
stole 1
over 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
pleasure 1
i 1
started 1
up 1
and 1
beheld 1
a 1
radiant 1
form 1
rise 1
from 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
the 1
moon 1
i 1
gazed 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
wonder 1
it 1
moved 1
slowly 1
but 1
it 1
enlightened 1
my 1
path 1
and 1
i 1
again 1
went 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
berries 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
cold 1
when 1
under 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
huge 1
cloak 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
covered 1
myself 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
no 1
distinct 1
ideas 1
occupied 1
my 1
mind 1
all 1
was 1
confused 1
i 1
felt 1
light 1
and 1
hunger 1
and 1
thirst 1
and 1
darkness 1
innumerable 1
sounds 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
and 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
various 1
scents 1
saluted 1
me 1
the 1
only 1
object 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
distinguish 1
was 1
the 1
bright 1
moon 1
and 1
i 1
fixed 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
that 1
with 1
pleasure 1
several 1
changes 1
of 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
passed 1
and 1
the 1
orb 1
of 1
night 1
had 1
greatly 1
lessened 1
when 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
distinguish 1
my 1
sensations 1
from 1
each 1
other 1
i 1
gradually 1
saw 1
plainly 1
the 1
clear 1
stream 1
that 1
supplied 1
me 1
with 1
drink 1
and 1
the 1
trees 1
that 1
shaded 1
me 1
with 1
their 1
foliage 1
i 1
was 1
delighted 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
discovered 1
that 1
a 1
pleasant 1
sound 1
which 1
often 1
saluted 1
my 1
ears 1
proceeded 1
from 1
the 1
throats 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
winged 1
animals 1
who 1
had 1
often 1
intercepted 1
the 1
light 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
i 1
began 1
also 1
to 1
observe 1
with 1
greater 1
accuracy 1
the 1
forms 1
that 1
surrounded 1
me 1
and 1
to 1
perceive 1
the 1
boundaries 1
of 1
the 1
radiant 1
roof 1
of 1
light 1
which 1
canopied 1
me 1
sometimes 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
imitate 1
the 1
pleasant 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
but 1
was 1
unable 1
sometimes 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
express 1
my 1
sensations 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mode 1
but 1
the 1
uncouth 1
and 1
inarticulate 1
sounds 1
which 1
broke 1
from 1
me 1
frightened 1
me 1
into 1
silence 1
again 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
disappeared 1
from 1
the 1
night 1
and 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
lessened 1
form 1
showed 1
itself 1
while 1
i 1
still 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
forest 1
my 1
sensations 1
had 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
become 1
distinct 1
and 1
my 1
mind 1
received 1
every 1
day 1
additional 1
ideas 1
my 1
eyes 1
became 1
accustomed 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
to 1
perceive 1
objects 1
in 1
their 1
right 1
forms 1
i 1
distinguished 1
the 1
insect 1
from 1
the 1
herb 1
and 1
by 1
degrees 1
one 1
herb 1
from 1
another 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
sparrow 1
uttered 1
none 1
but 1
harsh 1
notes 1
whilst 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
blackbird 1
and 1
thrush 1
were 1
sweet 1
and 1
enticing 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
cold 1
i 1
found 1
a 1
fire 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
by 1
some 1
wandering 1
beggars 1
and 1
was 1
overcome 1
with 1
delight 1
at 1
the 1
warmth 1
i 1
experienced 1
from 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
joy 1
i 1
thrust 1
my 1
hand 1
into 1
the 1
live 1
embers 1
but 1
quickly 1
drew 1
it 1
out 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
pain 1
how 1
strange 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
cause 1
should 1
produce 1
such 1
opposite 1
effects 1
i 1
examined 1
the 1
materials 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
to 1
my 1
joy 1
found 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
composed 1
of 1
wood 1
i 1
quickly 1
collected 1
some 1
branches 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
wet 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
burn 1
i 1
was 1
pained 1
at 1
this 1
and 1
sat 1
still 1
watching 1
the 1
operation 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
the 1
wet 1
wood 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
placed 1
near 1
the 1
heat 1
dried 1
and 1
itself 1
became 1
inflamed 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
this 1
and 1
by 1
touching 1
the 1
various 1
branches 1
i 1
discovered 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
busied 1
myself 1
in 1
collecting 1
a 1
great 1
quantity 1
of 1
wood 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
dry 1
it 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
plentiful 1
supply 1
of 1
fire 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
and 1
brought 1
sleep 1
with 1
it 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
fear 1
lest 1
my 1
fire 1
should 1
be 1
extinguished 1
i 1
covered 1
it 1
carefully 1
with 1
dry 1
wood 1
and 1
leaves 1
and 1
placed 1
wet 1
branches 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
spreading 1
my 1
cloak 1
i 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
sank 1
into 1
sleep 1
it 1
was 1
morning 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
care 1
was 1
to 1
visit 1
the 1
fire 1
i 1
uncovered 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
quickly 1
fanned 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
flame 1
i 1
observed 1
this 1
also 1
and 1
contrived 1
a 1
fan 1
of 1
branches 1
which 1
roused 1
the 1
embers 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
nearly 1
extinguished 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
again 1
i 1
found 1
with 1
pleasure 1
that 1
the 1
fire 1
gave 1
light 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
heat 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
this 1
element 1
was 1
useful 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
food 1
for 1
i 1
found 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
offals 1
that 1
the 1
travellers 1
had 1
left 1
had 1
been 1
roasted 1
and 1
tasted 1
much 1
more 1
savoury 1
than 1
the 1
berries 1
i 1
gathered 1
from 1
the 1
trees 1
i 1
tried 1
therefore 1
to 1
dress 1
my 1
food 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
placing 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
live 1
embers 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
berries 1
were 1
spoiled 1
by 1
this 1
operation 1
and 1
the 1
nuts 1
and 1
roots 1
much 1
improved 1
food 1
however 1
became 1
scarce 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
spent 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
searching 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
acorns 1
to 1
assuage 1
the 1
pangs 1
of 1
hunger 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
this 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
place 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
hitherto 1
inhabited 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
one 1
where 1
the 1
few 1
wants 1
i 1
experienced 1
would 1
be 1
more 1
easily 1
satisfied 1
in 1
this 1
emigration 1
i 1
exceedingly 1
lamented 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
obtained 1
through 1
accident 1
and 1
knew 1
not 1
how 1
to 1
reproduce 1
it 1
i 1
gave 1
several 1
hours 1
to 1
the 1
serious 1
consideration 1
of 1
this 1
difficulty 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
relinquish 1
all 1
attempt 1
to 1
supply 1
it 1
and 1
wrapping 1
myself 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
cloak 1
i 1
struck 1
across 1
the 1
wood 1
towards 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
i 1
passed 1
three 1
days 1
in 1
these 1
rambles 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
discovered 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
a 1
great 1
fall 1
of 1
snow 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
fields 1
were 1
of 1
one 1
uniform 1
white 1
the 1
appearance 1
was 1
disconsolate 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
my 1
feet 1
chilled 1
by 1
the 1
cold 1
damp 1
substance 1
that 1
covered 1
the 1
ground 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
seven 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
obtain 1
food 1
and 1
shelter 1
at 1
length 1
i 1
perceived 1
a 1
small 1
hut 1
on 1
a 1
rising 1
ground 1
which 1
had 1
doubtless 1
been 1
built 1
for 1
the 1
convenience 1
of 1
some 1
shepherd 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
sight 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
examined 1
the 1
structure 1
with 1
great 1
curiosity 1
finding 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
i 1
entered 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
sat 1
in 1
it 1
near 1
a 1
fire 1
over 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
preparing 1
his 1
breakfast 1
he 1
turned 1
on 1
hearing 1
a 1
noise 1
and 1
perceiving 1
me 1
shrieked 1
loudly 1
and 1
quitting 1
the 1
hut 1
ran 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
with 1
a 1
speed 1
of 1
which 1
his 1
debilitated 1
form 1
hardly 1
appeared 1
capable 1
his 1
appearance 1
different 1
from 1
any 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
before 1
seen 1
and 1
his 1
flight 1
somewhat 1
surprised 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
enchanted 1
by 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
here 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
rain 1
could 1
not 1
penetrate 1
the 1
ground 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
it 1
presented 1
to 1
me 1
then 1
as 1
exquisite 1
and 1
divine 1
a 1
retreat 1
as 1
pandemonium 1
appeared 1
to 1
the 1
demons 1
of 1
hell 1
after 1
their 1
sufferings 1
in 1
the 1
lake 1
of 1
fire 1
i 1
greedily 1
devoured 1
the 1
remnants 1
of 1
the 1
shepherd 1
s 1
breakfast 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
bread 1
cheese 1
milk 1
and 1
wine 1
the 1
latter 1
however 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
then 1
overcome 1
by 1
fatigue 1
i 1
lay 1
down 1
among 1
some 1
straw 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
it 1
was 1
noon 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
and 1
allured 1
by 1
the 1
warmth 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
which 1
shone 1
brightly 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
ground 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
recommence 1
my 1
travels 1
and 1
depositing 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
peasant 1
s 1
breakfast 1
in 1
a 1
wallet 1
i 1
found 1
i 1
proceeded 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
until 1
at 1
sunset 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
village 1
how 1
miraculous 1
did 1
this 1
appear 1
the 1
huts 1
the 1
neater 1
cottages 1
and 1
stately 1
houses 1
engaged 1
my 1
admiration 1
by 1
turns 1
the 1
vegetables 1
in 1
the 1
gardens 1
the 1
milk 1
and 1
cheese 1
that 1
i 1
saw 1
placed 1
at 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
cottages 1
allured 1
my 1
appetite 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
these 1
i 1
entered 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
hardly 1
placed 1
my 1
foot 1
within 1
the 1
door 1
before 1
the 1
children 1
shrieked 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
fainted 1
the 1
whole 1
village 1
was 1
roused 1
some 1
fled 1
some 1
attacked 1
me 1
until 1
grievously 1
bruised 1
by 1
stones 1
and 1
many 1
other 1
kinds 1
of 1
missile 1
weapons 1
i 1
escaped 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
country 1
and 1
fearfully 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
hovel 1
quite 1
bare 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
wretched 1
appearance 1
after 1
the 1
palaces 1
i 1
had 1
beheld 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
this 1
hovel 1
however 1
joined 1
a 1
cottage 1
of 1
a 1
neat 1
and 1
pleasant 1
appearance 1
but 1
after 1
my 1
late 1
dearly 1
bought 1
experience 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
enter 1
it 1
my 1
place 1
of 1
refuge 1
was 1
constructed 1
of 1
wood 1
but 1
so 1
low 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
with 1
difficulty 1
sit 1
upright 1
in 1
it 1
no 1
wood 1
however 1
was 1
placed 1
on 1
the 1
earth 1
which 1
formed 1
the 1
floor 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
dry 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
wind 1
entered 1
it 1
by 1
innumerable 1
chinks 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
an 1
agreeable 1
asylum 1
from 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
rain 1
here 1
then 1
i 1
retreated 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
happy 1
to 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
shelter 1
however 1
miserable 1
from 1
the 1
inclemency 1
of 1
the 1
season 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
from 1
the 1
barbarity 1
of 1
man 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
morning 1
dawned 1
i 1
crept 1
from 1
my 1
kennel 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
view 1
the 1
adjacent 1
cottage 1
and 1
discover 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
habitation 1
i 1
had 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
situated 1
against 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
surrounded 1
on 1
the 1
sides 1
which 1
were 1
exposed 1
by 1
a 1
pig 1
sty 1
and 1
a 1
clear 1
pool 1
of 1
water 1
one 1
part 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
crept 1
in 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
covered 1
every 1
crevice 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
perceived 1
with 1
stones 1
and 1
wood 1
yet 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
move 1
them 1
on 1
occasion 1
to 1
pass 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
light 1
i 1
enjoyed 1
came 1
through 1
the 1
sty 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
sufficient 1
for 1
me 1
having 1
thus 1
arranged 1
my 1
dwelling 1
and 1
carpeted 1
it 1
with 1
clean 1
straw 1
i 1
retired 1
for 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
i 1
remembered 1
too 1
well 1
my 1
treatment 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
to 1
trust 1
myself 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
however 1
provided 1
for 1
my 1
sustenance 1
for 1
that 1
day 1
by 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
coarse 1
bread 1
which 1
i 1
purloined 1
and 1
a 1
cup 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
drink 1
more 1
conveniently 1
than 1
from 1
my 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
pure 1
water 1
which 1
flowed 1
by 1
my 1
retreat 1
the 1
floor 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
raised 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
kept 1
perfectly 1
dry 1
and 1
by 1
its 1
vicinity 1
to 1
the 1
chimney 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
it 1
was 1
tolerably 1
warm 1
being 1
thus 1
provided 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
reside 1
in 1
this 1
hovel 1
until 1
something 1
should 1
occur 1
which 1
might 1
alter 1
my 1
determination 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
paradise 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
bleak 1
forest 1
my 1
former 1
residence 1
the 1
rain 1
dropping 1
branches 1
and 1
dank 1
earth 1
i 1
ate 1
my 1
breakfast 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
remove 1
a 1
plank 1
to 1
procure 1
myself 1
a 1
little 1
water 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
step 1
and 1
looking 1
through 1
a 1
small 1
chink 1
i 1
beheld 1
a 1
young 1
creature 1
with 1
a 1
pail 1
on 1
her 1
head 1
passing 1
before 1
my 1
hovel 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
young 1
and 1
of 1
gentle 1
demeanour 1
unlike 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
since 1
found 1
cottagers 1
and 1
farmhouse 1
servants 1
to 1
be 1
yet 1
she 1
was 1
meanly 1
dressed 1
a 1
coarse 1
blue 1
petticoat 1
and 1
a 1
linen 1
jacket 1
being 1
her 1
only 1
garb 1
her 1
fair 1
hair 1
was 1
plaited 1
but 1
not 1
adorned 1
she 1
looked 1
patient 1
yet 1
sad 1
i 1
lost 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
she 1
returned 1
bearing 1
the 1
pail 1
which 1
was 1
now 1
partly 1
filled 1
with 1
milk 1
as 1
she 1
walked 1
along 1
seemingly 1
incommoded 1
by 1
the 1
burden 1
a 1
young 1
man 1
met 1
her 1
whose 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
a 1
deeper 1
despondence 1
uttering 1
a 1
few 1
sounds 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
melancholy 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
pail 1
from 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
bore 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
himself 1
she 1
followed 1
and 1
they 1
disappeared 1
presently 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
again 1
with 1
some 1
tools 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
cross 1
the 1
field 1
behind 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
also 1
busied 1
sometimes 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
sometimes 1
in 1
the 1
yard 1
on 1
examining 1
my 1
dwelling 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
had 1
formerly 1
occupied 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
panes 1
had 1
been 1
filled 1
up 1
with 1
wood 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
and 1
almost 1
imperceptible 1
chink 1
through 1
which 1
the 1
eye 1
could 1
just 1
penetrate 1
through 1
this 1
crevice 1
a 1
small 1
room 1
was 1
visible 1
whitewashed 1
and 1
clean 1
but 1
very 1
bare 1
of 1
furniture 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
near 1
a 1
small 1
fire 1
sat 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
leaning 1
his 1
head 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
a 1
disconsolate 1
attitude 1
the 1
young 1
girl 1
was 1
occupied 1
in 1
arranging 1
the 1
cottage 1
but 1
presently 1
she 1
took 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
drawer 1
which 1
employed 1
her 1
hands 1
and 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
beside 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
who 1
taking 1
up 1
an 1
instrument 1
began 1
to 1
play 1
and 1
to 1
produce 1
sounds 1
sweeter 1
than 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
the 1
thrush 1
or 1
the 1
nightingale 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lovely 1
sight 1
even 1
to 1
me 1
poor 1
wretch 1
who 1
had 1
never 1
beheld 1
aught 1
beautiful 1
before 1
the 1
silver 1
hair 1
and 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
of 1
the 1
aged 1
cottager 1
won 1
my 1
reverence 1
while 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
enticed 1
my 1
love 1
he 1
played 1
a 1
sweet 1
mournful 1
air 1
which 1
i 1
perceived 1
drew 1
tears 1
from 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
his 1
amiable 1
companion 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
until 1
she 1
sobbed 1
audibly 1
he 1
then 1
pronounced 1
a 1
few 1
sounds 1
and 1
the 1
fair 1
creature 1
leaving 1
her 1
work 1
knelt 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
he 1
raised 1
her 1
and 1
smiled 1
with 1
such 1
kindness 1
and 1
affection 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
sensations 1
of 1
a 1
peculiar 1
and 1
overpowering 1
nature 1
they 1
were 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
pleasure 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
before 1
experienced 1
either 1
from 1
hunger 1
or 1
cold 1
warmth 1
or 1
food 1
and 1
i 1
withdrew 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
unable 1
to 1
bear 1
these 1
emotions 1
soon 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
returned 1
bearing 1
on 1
his 1
shoulders 1
a 1
load 1
of 1
wood 1
the 1
girl 1
met 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
helped 1
to 1
relieve 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
burden 1
and 1
taking 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
fuel 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
placed 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
then 1
she 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
went 1
apart 1
into 1
a 1
nook 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
he 1
showed 1
her 1
a 1
large 1
loaf 1
and 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
cheese 1
she 1
seemed 1
pleased 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
for 1
some 1
roots 1
and 1
plants 1
which 1
she 1
placed 1
in 1
water 1
and 1
then 1
upon 1
the 1
fire 1
she 1
afterwards 1
continued 1
her 1
work 1
whilst 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
garden 1
and 1
appeared 1
busily 1
employed 1
in 1
digging 1
and 1
pulling 1
up 1
roots 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
employed 1
thus 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
joined 1
him 1
and 1
they 1
entered 1
the 1
cottage 1
together 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
been 1
pensive 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
his 1
companions 1
he 1
assumed 1
a 1
more 1
cheerful 1
air 1
and 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
meal 1
was 1
quickly 1
dispatched 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
was 1
again 1
occupied 1
in 1
arranging 1
the 1
cottage 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
walked 1
before 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
leaning 1
on 1
the 1
arm 1
of 1
the 1
youth 1
nothing 1
could 1
exceed 1
in 1
beauty 1
the 1
contrast 1
between 1
these 1
two 1
excellent 1
creatures 1
one 1
was 1
old 1
with 1
silver 1
hairs 1
and 1
a 1
countenance 1
beaming 1
with 1
benevolence 1
and 1
love 1
the 1
younger 1
was 1
slight 1
and 1
graceful 1
in 1
his 1
figure 1
and 1
his 1
features 1
were 1
moulded 1
with 1
the 1
finest 1
symmetry 1
yet 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
attitude 1
expressed 1
the 1
utmost 1
sadness 1
and 1
despondency 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
with 1
tools 1
different 1
from 1
those 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
directed 1
his 1
steps 1
across 1
the 1
fields 1
night 1
quickly 1
shut 1
in 1
but 1
to 1
my 1
extreme 1
wonder 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
cottagers 1
had 1
a 1
means 1
of 1
prolonging 1
light 1
by 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
tapers 1
and 1
was 1
delighted 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
the 1
setting 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
did 1
not 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
pleasure 1
i 1
experienced 1
in 1
watching 1
my 1
human 1
neighbours 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
young 1
girl 1
and 1
her 1
companion 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
various 1
occupations 1
which 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
again 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
instrument 1
which 1
produced 1
the 1
divine 1
sounds 1
that 1
had 1
enchanted 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
the 1
youth 1
began 1
not 1
to 1
play 1
but 1
to 1
utter 1
sounds 1
that 1
were 1
monotonous 1
and 1
neither 1
resembling 1
the 1
harmony 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
instrument 1
nor 1
the 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
i 1
since 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
read 1
aloud 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
i 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
words 1
or 1
letters 1
the 1
family 1
after 1
having 1
been 1
thus 1
occupied 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
extinguished 1
their 1
lights 1
and 1
retired 1
as 1
i 1
conjectured 1
to 1
rest 1
chapter 1
12 1
i 1
lay 1
on 1
my 1
straw 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sleep 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
what 1
chiefly 1
struck 1
me 1
was 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
of 1
these 1
people 1
and 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
join 1
them 1
but 1
dared 1
not 1
i 1
remembered 1
too 1
well 1
the 1
treatment 1
i 1
had 1
suffered 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
from 1
the 1
barbarous 1
villagers 1
and 1
resolved 1
whatever 1
course 1
of 1
conduct 1
i 1
might 1
hereafter 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
to 1
pursue 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
i 1
would 1
remain 1
quietly 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
watching 1
and 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
motives 1
which 1
influenced 1
their 1
actions 1
the 1
cottagers 1
arose 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
before 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
arranged 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
prepared 1
the 1
food 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
departed 1
after 1
the 1
first 1
meal 1
this 1
day 1
was 1
passed 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
routine 1
as 1
that 1
which 1
preceded 1
it 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
was 1
constantly 1
employed 1
out 1
of 1
doors 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
in 1
various 1
laborious 1
occupations 1
within 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
whom 1
i 1
soon 1
perceived 1
to 1
be 1
blind 1
employed 1
his 1
leisure 1
hours 1
on 1
his 1
instrument 1
or 1
in 1
contemplation 1
nothing 1
could 1
exceed 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
respect 1
which 1
the 1
younger 1
cottagers 1
exhibited 1
towards 1
their 1
venerable 1
companion 1
they 1
performed 1
towards 1
him 1
every 1
little 1
office 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
duty 1
with 1
gentleness 1
and 1
he 1
rewarded 1
them 1
by 1
his 1
benevolent 1
smiles 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
entirely 1
happy 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
often 1
went 1
apart 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
weep 1
i 1
saw 1
no 1
cause 1
for 1
their 1
unhappiness 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
deeply 1
affected 1
by 1
it 1
if 1
such 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
were 1
miserable 1
it 1
was 1
less 1
strange 1
that 1
i 1
an 1
imperfect 1
and 1
solitary 1
being 1
should 1
be 1
wretched 1
yet 1
why 1
were 1
these 1
gentle 1
beings 1
unhappy 1
they 1
possessed 1
a 1
delightful 1
house 1
for 1
such 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
every 1
luxury 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
fire 1
to 1
warm 1
them 1
when 1
chill 1
and 1
delicious 1
viands 1
when 1
hungry 1
they 1
were 1
dressed 1
in 1
excellent 1
clothes 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
they 1
enjoyed 1
one 1
another 1
s 1
company 1
and 1
speech 1
interchanging 1
each 1
day 1
looks 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
kindness 1
what 1
did 1
their 1
tears 1
imply 1
did 1
they 1
really 1
express 1
pain 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
unable 1
to 1
solve 1
these 1
questions 1
but 1
perpetual 1
attention 1
and 1
time 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
many 1
appearances 1
which 1
were 1
at 1
first 1
enigmatic 1
a 1
considerable 1
period 1
elapsed 1
before 1
i 1
discovered 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
causes 1
of 1
the 1
uneasiness 1
of 1
this 1
amiable 1
family 1
it 1
was 1
poverty 1
and 1
they 1
suffered 1
that 1
evil 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
distressing 1
degree 1
their 1
nourishment 1
consisted 1
entirely 1
of 1
the 1
vegetables 1
of 1
their 1
garden 1
and 1
the 1
milk 1
of 1
one 1
cow 1
which 1
gave 1
very 1
little 1
during 1
the 1
winter 1
when 1
its 1
masters 1
could 1
scarcely 1
procure 1
food 1
to 1
support 1
it 1
they 1
often 1
i 1
believe 1
suffered 1
the 1
pangs 1
of 1
hunger 1
very 1
poignantly 1
especially 1
the 1
two 1
younger 1
cottagers 1
for 1
several 1
times 1
they 1
placed 1
food 1
before 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
when 1
they 1
reserved 1
none 1
for 1
themselves 1
this 1
trait 1
of 1
kindness 1
moved 1
me 1
sensibly 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
to 1
steal 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
their 1
store 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
consumption 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
in 1
doing 1
this 1
i 1
inflicted 1
pain 1
on 1
the 1
cottagers 1
i 1
abstained 1
and 1
satisfied 1
myself 1
with 1
berries 1
nuts 1
and 1
roots 1
which 1
i 1
gathered 1
from 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
wood 1
i 1
discovered 1
also 1
another 1
means 1
through 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
enabled 1
to 1
assist 1
their 1
labours 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
youth 1
spent 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
of 1
each 1
day 1
in 1
collecting 1
wood 1
for 1
the 1
family 1
fire 1
and 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
i 1
often 1
took 1
his 1
tools 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
and 1
brought 1
home 1
firing 1
sufficient 1
for 1
the 1
consumption 1
of 1
several 1
days 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
this 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
when 1
she 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
appeared 1
greatly 1
astonished 1
on 1
seeing 1
a 1
great 1
pile 1
of 1
wood 1
on 1
the 1
outside 1
she 1
uttered 1
some 1
words 1
in 1
a 1
loud 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
joined 1
her 1
who 1
also 1
expressed 1
surprise 1
i 1
observed 1
with 1
pleasure 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
forest 1
that 1
day 1
but 1
spent 1
it 1
in 1
repairing 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
cultivating 1
the 1
garden 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
discovery 1
of 1
still 1
greater 1
moment 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
these 1
people 1
possessed 1
a 1
method 1
of 1
communicating 1
their 1
experience 1
and 1
feelings 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
by 1
articulate 1
sounds 1
i 1
perceived 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
they 1
spoke 1
sometimes 1
produced 1
pleasure 1
or 1
pain 1
smiles 1
or 1
sadness 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
and 1
countenances 1
of 1
the 1
hearers 1
this 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
godlike 1
science 1
and 1
i 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
it 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
baffled 1
in 1
every 1
attempt 1
i 1
made 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
their 1
pronunciation 1
was 1
quick 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
they 1
uttered 1
not 1
having 1
any 1
apparent 1
connection 1
with 1
visible 1
objects 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
discover 1
any 1
clue 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
unravel 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
their 1
reference 1
by 1
great 1
application 1
however 1
and 1
after 1
having 1
remained 1
during 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
several 1
revolutions 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
i 1
discovered 1
the 1
names 1
that 1
were 1
given 1
to 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
familiar 1
objects 1
of 1
discourse 1
i 1
learned 1
and 1
applied 1
the 1
words 1
fire 1
milk 1
bread 1
and 1
wood 1
i 1
learned 1
also 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
themselves 1
the 1
youth 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
had 1
each 1
of 1
them 1
several 1
names 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
had 1
only 1
one 1
which 1
was 1
father 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
called 1
sister 1
or 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
youth 1
felix 1
brother 1
or 1
son 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
the 1
delight 1
i 1
felt 1
when 1
i 1
learned 1
the 1
ideas 1
appropriated 1
to 1
each 1
of 1
these 1
sounds 1
and 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
pronounce 1
them 1
i 1
distinguished 1
several 1
other 1
words 1
without 1
being 1
able 1
as 1
yet 1
to 1
understand 1
or 1
apply 1
them 1
such 1
as 1
good 1
dearest 1
unhappy 1
i 1
spent 1
the 1
winter 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
and 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
greatly 1
endeared 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
unhappy 1
i 1
felt 1
depressed 1
when 1
they 1
rejoiced 1
i 1
sympathized 1
in 1
their 1
joys 1
i 1
saw 1
few 1
human 1
beings 1
besides 1
them 1
and 1
if 1
any 1
other 1
happened 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
cottage 1
their 1
harsh 1
manners 1
and 1
rude 1
gait 1
only 1
enhanced 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
superior 1
accomplishments 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
i 1
could 1
perceive 1
often 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
encourage 1
his 1
children 1
as 1
sometimes 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
called 1
them 1
to 1
cast 1
off 1
their 1
melancholy 1
he 1
would 1
talk 1
in 1
a 1
cheerful 1
accent 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
goodness 1
that 1
bestowed 1
pleasure 1
even 1
upon 1
me 1
agatha 1
listened 1
with 1
respect 1
her 1
eyes 1
sometimes 1
filled 1
with 1
tears 1
which 1
she 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
wipe 1
away 1
unperceived 1
but 1
i 1
generally 1
found 1
that 1
her 1
countenance 1
and 1
tone 1
were 1
more 1
cheerful 1
after 1
having 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
exhortations 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
thus 1
with 1
felix 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
saddest 1
of 1
the 1
group 1
and 1
even 1
to 1
my 1
unpractised 1
senses 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
suffered 1
more 1
deeply 1
than 1
his 1
friends 1
but 1
if 1
his 1
countenance 1
was 1
more 1
sorrowful 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
more 1
cheerful 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
his 1
sister 1
especially 1
when 1
he 1
addressed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
i 1
could 1
mention 1
innumerable 1
instances 1
which 1
although 1
slight 1
marked 1
the 1
dispositions 1
of 1
these 1
amiable 1
cottagers 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
poverty 1
and 1
want 1
felix 1
carried 1
with 1
pleasure 1
to 1
his 1
sister 1
the 1
first 1
little 1
white 1
flower 1
that 1
peeped 1
out 1
from 1
beneath 1
the 1
snowy 1
ground 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
she 1
had 1
risen 1
he 1
cleared 1
away 1
the 1
snow 1
that 1
obstructed 1
her 1
path 1
to 1
the 1
milk 1
house 1
drew 1
water 1
from 1
the 1
well 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
wood 1
from 1
the 1
outhouse 1
where 1
to 1
his 1
perpetual 1
astonishment 1
he 1
found 1
his 1
store 1
always 1
replenished 1
by 1
an 1
invisible 1
hand 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
believe 1
he 1
worked 1
sometimes 1
for 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
farmer 1
because 1
he 1
often 1
went 1
forth 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
until 1
dinner 1
yet 1
brought 1
no 1
wood 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
he 1
worked 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
but 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
frosty 1
season 1
he 1
read 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
agatha 1
this 1
reading 1
had 1
puzzled 1
me 1
extremely 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
uttered 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
sounds 1
when 1
he 1
read 1
as 1
when 1
he 1
talked 1
i 1
conjectured 1
therefore 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
paper 1
signs 1
for 1
speech 1
which 1
he 1
understood 1
and 1
i 1
ardently 1
longed 1
to 1
comprehend 1
these 1
also 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
that 1
possible 1
when 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
understand 1
the 1
sounds 1
for 1
which 1
they 1
stood 1
as 1
signs 1
i 1
improved 1
however 1
sensibly 1
in 1
this 1
science 1
but 1
not 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
follow 1
up 1
any 1
kind 1
of 1
conversation 1
although 1
i 1
applied 1
my 1
whole 1
mind 1
to 1
the 1
endeavour 1
for 1
i 1
easily 1
perceived 1
that 1
although 1
i 1
eagerly 1
longed 1
to 1
discover 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
cottagers 1
i 1
ought 1
not 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
attempt 1
until 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
become 1
master 1
of 1
their 1
language 1
which 1
knowledge 1
might 1
enable 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
overlook 1
the 1
deformity 1
of 1
my 1
figure 1
for 1
with 1
this 1
also 1
the 1
contrast 1
perpetually 1
presented 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
had 1
made 1
me 1
acquainted 1
i 1
had 1
admired 1
the 1
perfect 1
forms 1
of 1
my 1
cottagers 1
their 1
grace 1
beauty 1
and 1
delicate 1
complexions 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
i 1
terrified 1
when 1
i 1
viewed 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
transparent 1
pool 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
started 1
back 1
unable 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
i 1
who 1
was 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
mirror 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
became 1
fully 1
convinced 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
reality 1
the 1
monster 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
i 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
bitterest 1
sensations 1
of 1
despondence 1
and 1
mortification 1
alas 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
yet 1
entirely 1
know 1
the 1
fatal 1
effects 1
of 1
this 1
miserable 1
deformity 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
warmer 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
longer 1
the 1
snow 1
vanished 1
and 1
i 1
beheld 1
the 1
bare 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
earth 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
felix 1
was 1
more 1
employed 1
and 1
the 1
heart 1
moving 1
indications 1
of 1
impending 1
famine 1
disappeared 1
their 1
food 1
as 1
i 1
afterwards 1
found 1
was 1
coarse 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
wholesome 1
and 1
they 1
procured 1
a 1
sufficiency 1
of 1
it 1
several 1
new 1
kinds 1
of 1
plants 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
which 1
they 1
dressed 1
and 1
these 1
signs 1
of 1
comfort 1
increased 1
daily 1
as 1
the 1
season 1
advanced 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
leaning 1
on 1
his 1
son 1
walked 1
each 1
day 1
at 1
noon 1
when 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
rain 1
as 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
was 1
called 1
when 1
the 1
heavens 1
poured 1
forth 1
its 1
waters 1
this 1
frequently 1
took 1
place 1
but 1
a 1
high 1
wind 1
quickly 1
dried 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
the 1
season 1
became 1
far 1
more 1
pleasant 1
than 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
mode 1
of 1
life 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
was 1
uniform 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
i 1
attended 1
the 1
motions 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
dispersed 1
in 1
various 1
occupations 1
i 1
slept 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
spent 1
in 1
observing 1
my 1
friends 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
moon 1
or 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
star 1
light 1
i 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
collected 1
my 1
own 1
food 1
and 1
fuel 1
for 1
the 1
cottage 1
when 1
i 1
returned 1
as 1
often 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
i 1
cleared 1
their 1
path 1
from 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
performed 1
those 1
offices 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
done 1
by 1
felix 1
i 1
afterwards 1
found 1
that 1
these 1
labours 1
performed 1
by 1
an 1
invisible 1
hand 1
greatly 1
astonished 1
them 1
and 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
i 1
heard 1
them 1
on 1
these 1
occasions 1
utter 1
the 1
words 1
good 1
spirit 1
wonderful 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
then 1
understand 1
the 1
signification 1
of 1
these 1
terms 1
my 1
thoughts 1
now 1
became 1
more 1
active 1
and 1
i 1
longed 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
motives 1
and 1
feelings 1
of 1
these 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
i 1
was 1
inquisitive 1
to 1
know 1
why 1
felix 1
appeared 1
so 1
miserable 1
and 1
agatha 1
so 1
sad 1
i 1
thought 1
foolish 1
wretch 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
restore 1
happiness 1
to 1
these 1
deserving 1
people 1
when 1
i 1
slept 1
or 1
was 1
absent 1
the 1
forms 1
of 1
the 1
venerable 1
blind 1
father 1
the 1
gentle 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
excellent 1
felix 1
flitted 1
before 1
me 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
them 1
as 1
superior 1
beings 1
who 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
arbiters 1
of 1
my 1
future 1
destiny 1
i 1
formed 1
in 1
my 1
imagination 1
a 1
thousand 1
pictures 1
of 1
presenting 1
myself 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
their 1
reception 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
imagined 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
disgusted 1
until 1
by 1
my 1
gentle 1
demeanour 1
and 1
conciliating 1
words 1
i 1
should 1
first 1
win 1
their 1
favour 1
and 1
afterwards 1
their 1
love 1
these 1
thoughts 1
exhilarated 1
me 1
and 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
apply 1
with 1
fresh 1
ardour 1
to 1
the 1
acquiring 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
language 1
my 1
organs 1
were 1
indeed 1
harsh 1
but 1
supple 1
and 1
although 1
my 1
voice 1
was 1
very 1
unlike 1
the 1
soft 1
music 1
of 1
their 1
tones 1
yet 1
i 1
pronounced 1
such 1
words 1
as 1
i 1
understood 1
with 1
tolerable 1
ease 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
the 1
ass 1
and 1
the 1
lap 1
dog 1
yet 1
surely 1
the 1
gentle 1
ass 1
whose 1
intentions 1
were 1
affectionate 1
although 1
his 1
manners 1
were 1
rude 1
deserved 1
better 1
treatment 1
than 1
blows 1
and 1
execration 1
the 1
pleasant 1
showers 1
and 1
genial 1
warmth 1
of 1
spring 1
greatly 1
altered 1
the 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
men 1
who 1
before 1
this 1
change 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
hid 1
in 1
caves 1
dispersed 1
themselves 1
and 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
various 1
arts 1
of 1
cultivation 1
the 1
birds 1
sang 1
in 1
more 1
cheerful 1
notes 1
and 1
the 1
leaves 1
began 1
to 1

forth 1

so 1

my 1

by 1
the 1

the 1

part 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
i 1
shall 1
relate 1
events 1
that 1
impressed 1
me 1
with 1
feelings 1
which 1
from 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
have 1
made 1
me 1
what 1
i 1
am 1
spring 1
advanced 1
rapidly 1
the 1
weather 1
became 1
fine 1
and 1
the 1
skies 1
cloudless 1
it 1
surprised 1
me 1
that 1
what 1
before 1
was 1
desert 1
and 1
gloomy 1
should 1
now 1
bloom 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
flowers 1
and 1
verdure 1
my 1
senses 1
were 1
gratified 1
and 1
refreshed 1
by 1
a 1
thousand 1
scents 1
of 1
delight 1
and 1
a 1
thousand 1
sights 1
of 1
beauty 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
days 1
when 1
my 1
cottagers 1
periodically 1
rested 1
from 1
labour 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
played 1
on 1
his 1
guitar 1
and 1
the 1
children 1
listened 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
observed 1
the 1
countenance 1
of 1
felix 1
was 1
melancholy 1
beyond 1
expression 1
he 1
sighed 1
frequently 1
and 1
once 1
his 1
father 1
paused 1
in 1
his 1
music 1
and 1
i 1
conjectured 1
by 1
his 1
manner 1
that 1
he 1
inquired 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
s 1
sorrow 1
felix 1
replied 1
in 1
a 1
cheerful 1
accent 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
recommencing 1
his 1
music 1
when 1
someone 1
tapped 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
lady 1
on 1
horseback 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
country 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
guide 1
the 1
lady 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
dark 1
suit 1
and 1
covered 1
with 1
a 1
thick 1
black 1
veil 1
agatha 1
asked 1
a 1
question 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
stranger 1
only 1
replied 1
by 1
pronouncing 1
in 1
a 1
sweet 1
accent 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
felix 1
her 1
voice 1
was 1
musical 1
but 1
unlike 1
that 1
of 1
either 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
word 1
felix 1
came 1
up 1
hastily 1
to 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
him 1
threw 1
up 1
her 1
veil 1
and 1
i 1
beheld 1
a 1
countenance 1
of 1
angelic 1
beauty 1
and 1
expression 1
her 1
hair 1
of 1
a 1
shining 1
raven 1
black 1
and 1
curiously 1
braided 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
dark 1
but 1
gentle 1
although 1
animated 1
her 1
features 1
of 1
a 1
regular 1
proportion 1
and 1
her 1
complexion 1
wondrously 1
fair 1
each 1
cheek 1
tinged 1
with 1
a 1
lovely 1
pink 1
felix 1
seemed 1
ravished 1
with 1
delight 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
every 1
trait 1
of 1
sorrow 1
vanished 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
it 1
instantly 1
expressed 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
ecstatic 1
joy 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
believed 1
it 1
capable 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
as 1
his 1
cheek 1
flushed 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
thought 1
him 1
as 1
beautiful 1
as 1
the 1
stranger 1
she 1
appeared 1
affected 1
by 1
different 1
feelings 1
wiping 1
a 1
few 1
tears 1
from 1
her 1
lovely 1
eyes 1
she 1
held 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
felix 1
who 1
kissed 1
it 1
rapturously 1
and 1
called 1
her 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
distinguish 1
his 1
sweet 1
arabian 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
understand 1
him 1
but 1
smiled 1
he 1
assisted 1
her 1
to 1
dismount 1
and 1
dismissing 1
her 1
guide 1
conducted 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
some 1
conversation 1
took 1
place 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
stranger 1
knelt 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
feet 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
kissed 1
his 1
hand 1
but 1
he 1
raised 1
her 1
and 1
embraced 1
her 1
affectionately 1
i 1
soon 1
perceived 1
that 1
although 1
the 1
stranger 1
uttered 1
articulate 1
sounds 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
language 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
she 1
was 1
neither 1
understood 1
by 1
nor 1
herself 1
understood 1
the 1
cottagers 1
they 1
made 1
many 1
signs 1
which 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
comprehend 1
but 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
her 1
presence 1
diffused 1
gladness 1
through 1
the 1
cottage 1
dispelling 1
their 1
sorrow 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
dissipates 1
the 1
morning 1
mists 1
felix 1
seemed 1
peculiarly 1
happy 1
and 1
with 1
smiles 1
of 1
delight 1
welcomed 1
his 1
arabian 1
agatha 1
the 1
ever 1
gentle 1
agatha 1
kissed 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
lovely 1
stranger 1
and 1
pointing 1
to 1
her 1
brother 1
made 1
signs 1
which 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
mean 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
sorrowful 1
until 1
she 1
came 1
some 1
hours 1
passed 1
thus 1
while 1
they 1
by 1
their 1
countenances 1
expressed 1
joy 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
comprehend 1
presently 1
i 1
found 1
by 1
the 1
frequent 1
recurrence 1
of 1
some 1
sound 1
which 1
the 1
stranger 1
repeated 1
after 1
them 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
learn 1
their 1
language 1
and 1
the 1
idea 1
instantly 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
instructions 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
end 1
the 1
stranger 1
learned 1
about 1
twenty 1
words 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
lesson 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
indeed 1
were 1
those 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
understood 1
but 1
i 1
profited 1
by 1
the 1
others 1
as 1
night 1
came 1
on 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
arabian 1
retired 1
early 1
when 1
they 1
separated 1
felix 1
kissed 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
and 1
said 1
good 1
night 1
sweet 1
safie 1
he 1
sat 1
up 1
much 1
longer 1
conversing 1
with 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
frequent 1
repetition 1
of 1
her 1
name 1
i 1
conjectured 1
that 1
their 1
lovely 1
guest 1
was 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
their 1
conversation 1
i 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
understand 1
them 1
and 1
bent 1
every 1
faculty 1
towards 1
that 1
purpose 1
but 1
found 1
it 1
utterly 1
impossible 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
felix 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
usual 1
occupations 1
of 1
agatha 1
were 1
finished 1
the 1
arabian 1
sat 1
at 1
the 1
feet 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
taking 1
his 1
guitar 1
played 1
some 1
airs 1
so 1
entrancingly 1
beautiful 1
that 1
they 1
at 1
once 1
drew 1
tears 1
of 1
sorrow 1
and 1
delight 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
she 1
sang 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
flowed 1
in 1
a 1
rich 1
cadence 1
swelling 1
or 1
dying 1
away 1
like 1
a 1
nightingale 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
finished 1
she 1
gave 1
the 1
guitar 1
to 1
agatha 1
who 1
at 1
first 1
declined 1
it 1
she 1
played 1
a 1
simple 1
air 1
and 1
her 1
voice 1
accompanied 1
it 1
in 1
sweet 1
accents 1
but 1
unlike 1
the 1
wondrous 1
strain 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
appeared 1
enraptured 1
and 1
said 1
some 1
words 1
which 1
agatha 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
explain 1
to 1
safie 1
and 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
wish 1
to 1
express 1
that 1
she 1
bestowed 1
on 1
him 1
the 1
greatest 1
delight 1
by 1
her 1
music 1
the 1
days 1
now 1
passed 1
as 1
peaceably 1
as 1
before 1
with 1
the 1
sole 1
alteration 1
that 1
joy 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
of 1
sadness 1
in 1
the 1
countenances 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
safie 1
was 1
always 1
gay 1
and 1
happy 1
she 1
and 1
i 1
improved 1
rapidly 1
in 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
language 1
so 1
that 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
comprehend 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
words 1
uttered 1
by 1
my 1
protectors 1
in 1
the 1
meanwhile 1
also 1
the 1
black 1
ground 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
herbage 1
and 1
the 1
green 1
banks 1
interspersed 1
with 1
innumerable 1
flowers 1
sweet 1
to 1
the 1
scent 1
and 1
the 1
eyes 1
stars 1
of 1
pale 1
radiance 1
among 1
the 1
moonlight 1
woods 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
warmer 1
the 1
nights 1
clear 1
and 1
balmy 1
and 1
my 1
nocturnal 1
rambles 1
were 1
an 1
extreme 1
pleasure 1
to 1
me 1
although 1
they 1
were 1
considerably 1
shortened 1
by 1
the 1
late 1
setting 1
and 1
early 1
rising 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
for 1
i 1
never 1
ventured 1
abroad 1
during 1
daylight 1
fearful 1
of 1
meeting 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
treatment 1
i 1
had 1
formerly 1
endured 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
village 1
which 1
i 1
entered 1
my 1
days 1
were 1
spent 1
in 1
close 1
attention 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
more 1
speedily 1
master 1
the 1
language 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
boast 1
that 1
i 1
improved 1
more 1
rapidly 1
than 1
the 1
arabian 1
who 1
understood 1
very 1
little 1
and 1
conversed 1
in 1
broken 1
accents 1
whilst 1
i 1
comprehended 1
and 1
could 1
imitate 1
almost 1
every 1
word 1
that 1
was 1
spoken 1
while 1
i 1
improved 1
in 1
speech 1
i 1
also 1
learned 1
the 1
science 1
of 1
letters 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
taught 1
to 1
the 1
stranger 1
and 1
this 1
opened 1
before 1
me 1
a 1
wide 1
field 1
for 1
wonder 1
and 1
delight 1
the 1
book 1
from 1
which 1
felix 1
instructed 1
safie 1
was 1
volney 1
s 1
ruins 1
of 1
empires 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
understood 1
the 1
purport 1
of 1
this 1
book 1
had 1
not 1
felix 1
in 1
reading 1
it 1
given 1
very 1
minute 1
explanations 1
he 1
had 1
chosen 1
this 1
work 1
he 1
said 1
because 1
the 1
declamatory 1
style 1
was 1
framed 1
in 1
imitation 1
of 1
the 1
eastern 1
authors 1
through 1
this 1
work 1
i 1
obtained 1
a 1
cursory 1
knowledge 1
of 1
history 1
and 1
a 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
several 1
empires 1
at 1
present 1
existing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
it 1
gave 1
me 1
an 1
insight 1
into 1
the 1
manners 1
governments 1
and 1
religions 1
of 1
the 1
different 1
nations 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
slothful 1
asiatics 1
of 1
the 1
stupendous 1
genius 1
and 1
mental 1
activity 1
of 1
the 1
grecians 1
of 1
the 1
wars 1
and 1
wonderful 1
virtue 1
of 1
the 1
early 1
romans 1
of 1
their 1
subsequent 1
degenerating 1
of 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
that 1
mighty 1
empire 1
of 1
chivalry 1
christianity 1
and 1
kings 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
the 1
american 1
hemisphere 1
and 1
wept 1
with 1
safie 1
over 1
the 1
hapless 1
fate 1
of 1
its 1
original 1
inhabitants 1
these 1
wonderful 1
narrations 1
inspired 1
me 1
with 1
strange 1
feelings 1
was 1
man 1
indeed 1
at 1
once 1
so 1
powerful 1
so 1
virtuous 1
and 1
magnificent 1
yet 1
so 1
vicious 1
and 1
base 1
he 1
appeared 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
a 1
mere 1
scion 1
of 1
the 1
evil 1
principle 1
and 1
at 1
another 1
as 1
all 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
conceived 1
of 1
noble 1
and 1
godlike 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
virtuous 1
man 1
appeared 1
the 1
highest 1
honour 1
that 1
can 1
befall 1
a 1
sensitive 1
being 1
to 1
be 1
base 1
and 1
vicious 1
as 1
many 1
on 1
record 1
have 1
been 1
appeared 1
the 1
lowest 1
degradation 1
a 1
condition 1
more 1
abject 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
blind 1
mole 1
or 1
harmless 1
worm 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
conceive 1
how 1
one 1
man 1
could 1
go 1
forth 1
to 1
murder 1
his 1
fellow 1
or 1
even 1
why 1
there 1
were 1
laws 1
and 1
governments 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
details 1
of 1
vice 1
and 1
bloodshed 1
my 1
wonder 1
ceased 1
and 1
i 1
turned 1
away 1
with 1
disgust 1
and 1
loathing 1
every 1
conversation 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
now 1
opened 1
new 1
wonders 1
to 1
me 1
while 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
instructions 1
which 1
felix 1
bestowed 1
upon 1
the 1
arabian 1
the 1
strange 1
system 1
of 1
human 1
society 1
was 1
explained 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
division 1
of 1
property 1
of 1
immense 1
wealth 1
and 1
squalid 1
poverty 1
of 1
rank 1
descent 1
and 1
noble 1
blood 1
the 1
words 1
induced 1
me 1
to 1
turn 1
towards 1
myself 1
i 1
learned 1
that 1
the 1
possessions 1
most 1
esteemed 1
by 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
were 1
high 1
and 1
unsullied 1
descent 1
united 1
with 1
riches 1
a 1
man 1
might 1
be 1
respected 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
advantages 1
but 1
without 1
either 1
he 1
was 1
considered 1
except 1
in 1
very 1
rare 1
instances 1
as 1
a 1
vagabond 1
and 1
a 1
slave 1
doomed 1
to 1
waste 1
his 1
powers 1
for 1
the 1
profits 1
of 1
the 1
chosen 1
few 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
i 1
of 1
my 1
creation 1
and 1
creator 1
i 1
was 1
absolutely 1
ignorant 1
but 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
possessed 1
no 1
money 1
no 1
friends 1
no 1
kind 1
of 1
property 1
i 1
was 1
besides 1
endued 1
with 1
a 1
figure 1
hideously 1
deformed 1
and 1
loathsome 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
nature 1
as 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
more 1
agile 1
than 1
they 1
and 1
could 1
subsist 1
upon 1
coarser 1
diet 1
i 1
bore 1
the 1
extremes 1
of 1
heat 1
and 1
cold 1
with 1
less 1
injury 1
to 1
my 1
frame 1
my 1
stature 1
far 1
exceeded 1
theirs 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
around 1
i 1
saw 1
and 1
heard 1
of 1
none 1
like 1
me 1
was 1
i 1
then 1
a 1
monster 1
a 1
blot 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
from 1
which 1
all 1
men 1
fled 1
and 1
whom 1
all 1
men 1
disowned 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
agony 1
that 1
these 1
reflections 1
inflicted 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
dispel 1
them 1
but 1
sorrow 1
only 1
increased 1
with 1
knowledge 1
oh 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
forever 1
remained 1
in 1
my 1
native 1
wood 1
nor 1
known 1
nor 1
felt 1
beyond 1
the 1
sensations 1
of 1
hunger 1
thirst 1
and 1
heat 1
of 1
what 1
a 1
strange 1
nature 1
is 1
knowledge 1
it 1
clings 1
to 1
the 1
mind 1
when 1
it 1
has 1
once 1
seized 1
on 1
it 1
like 1
a 1
lichen 1
on 1
the 1
rock 1
i 1
wished 1
sometimes 1
to 1
shake 1
off 1
all 1
thought 1
and 1
feeling 1
but 1
i 1
learned 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
means 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
sensation 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
death 1
a 1
state 1
which 1
i 1
feared 1
yet 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
i 1
admired 1
virtue 1
and 1
good 1
feelings 1
and 1
loved 1
the 1
gentle 1
manners 1
and 1
amiable 1
qualities 1
of 1
my 1
cottagers 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
shut 1
out 1
from 1
intercourse 1
with 1
them 1
except 1
through 1
means 1
which 1
i 1
obtained 1
by 1
stealth 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
unseen 1
and 1
unknown 1
and 1
which 1
rather 1
increased 1
than 1
satisfied 1
the 1
desire 1
i 1
had 1
of 1
becoming 1
one 1
among 1
my 1
fellows 1
the 1
gentle 1
words 1
of 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
animated 1
smiles 1
of 1
the 1
charming 1
arabian 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
mild 1
exhortations 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
lively 1
conversation 1
of 1
the 1
loved 1
felix 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
me 1
miserable 1
unhappy 1
wretch 1
other 1
lessons 1
were 1
impressed 1
upon 1
me 1
even 1
more 1
deeply 1
i 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
difference 1
of 1
sexes 1
and 1
the 1
birth 1
and 1
growth 1
of 1
children 1
how 1
the 1
father 1
doted 1
on 1
the 1
smiles 1
of 1
the 1
infant 1
and 1
the 1
lively 1
sallies 1
of 1
the 1
older 1
child 1
how 1
all 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
cares 1
of 1
the 1
mother 1
were 1
wrapped 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
precious 1
charge 1
how 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
youth 1
expanded 1
and 1
gained 1
knowledge 1
of 1
brother 1
sister 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
various 1
relationships 1
which 1
bind 1
one 1
human 1
being 1
to 1
another 1
in 1
mutual 1
bonds 1
but 1
where 1
were 1
my 1
friends 1
and 1
relations 1
no 1
father 1
had 1
watched 1
my 1
infant 1
days 1
no 1
mother 1
had 1
blessed 1
me 1
with 1
smiles 1
and 1
caresses 1
or 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
my 1
past 1
life 1
was 1
now 1
a 1
blot 1
a 1
blind 1
vacancy 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
distinguished 1
nothing 1
from 1
my 1
earliest 1
remembrance 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
as 1
i 1
then 1
was 1
in 1
height 1
and 1
proportion 1
i 1
had 1
never 1
yet 1
seen 1
a 1
being 1
resembling 1
me 1
or 1
who 1
claimed 1
any 1
intercourse 1
with 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
i 1
the 1
question 1
again 1
recurred 1
to 1
be 1
answered 1
only 1
with 1
groans 1
i 1
will 1
soon 1
explain 1
to 1
what 1
these 1
feelings 1
tended 1
but 1
allow 1
me 1
now 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
cottagers 1
whose 1
story 1
excited 1
in 1
me 1
such 1
various 1
feelings 1
of 1
indignation 1
delight 1
and 1
wonder 1
but 1
which 1
all 1
terminated 1
in 1
additional 1
love 1
and 1
reverence 1
for 1
my 1
protectors 1
for 1
so 1
i 1
loved 1
in 1
an 1
innocent 1
half 1
painful 1
self 1
deceit 1
to 1
call 1
them 1
chapter 1
14 1
some 1
time 1
elapsed 1
before 1
i 1
learned 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
could 1
not 1
fail 1
to 1
impress 1
itself 1
deeply 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
unfolding 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
circumstances 1
each 1
interesting 1
and 1
wonderful 1
to 1
one 1
so 1
utterly 1
inexperienced 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
was 1
de 1
lacey 1
he 1
was 1
descended 1
from 1
a 1
good 1
family 1
in 1
france 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
lived 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
in 1
affluence 1
respected 1
by 1
his 1
superiors 1
and 1
beloved 1
by 1
his 1
equals 1
his 1
son 1
was 1
bred 1
in 1
the 1
service 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
and 1
agatha 1
had 1
ranked 1
with 1
ladies 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
distinction 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
before 1
my 1
arrival 1
they 1
had 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
large 1
and 1
luxurious 1
city 1
called 1
paris 1
surrounded 1
by 1
friends 1
and 1
possessed 1
of 1
every 1
enjoyment 1
which 1
virtue 1
refinement 1
of 1
intellect 1
or 1
taste 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
moderate 1
fortune 1
could 1
afford 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
safie 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
their 1
ruin 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
turkish 1
merchant 1
and 1
had 1
inhabited 1
paris 1
for 1
many 1
years 1
when 1
for 1
some 1
reason 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
learn 1
he 1
became 1
obnoxious 1
to 1
the 1
government 1
he 1
was 1
seized 1
and 1
cast 1
into 1
prison 1
the 1
very 1
day 1
that 1
safie 1
arrived 1
from 1
constantinople 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
tried 1
and 1
condemned 1
to 1
death 1
the 1
injustice 1
of 1
his 1
sentence 1
was 1
very 1
flagrant 1
all 1
paris 1
was 1
indignant 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
judged 1
that 1
his 1
religion 1
and 1
wealth 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
crime 1
alleged 1
against 1
him 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
condemnation 1
felix 1
had 1
accidentally 1
been 1
present 1
at 1
the 1
trial 1
his 1
horror 1
and 1
indignation 1
were 1
uncontrollable 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
decision 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
he 1
made 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
a 1
solemn 1
vow 1
to 1
deliver 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
around 1
for 1
the 1
means 1
after 1
many 1
fruitless 1
attempts 1
to 1
gain 1
admittance 1
to 1
the 1
prison 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
strongly 1
grated 1
window 1
in 1
an 1
unguarded 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
which 1
lighted 1
the 1
dungeon 1
of 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
muhammadan 1
who 1
loaded 1
with 1
chains 1
waited 1
in 1
despair 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
the 1
barbarous 1
sentence 1
felix 1
visited 1
the 1
grate 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
made 1
known 1
to 1
the 1
prisoner 1
his 1
intentions 1
in 1
his 1
favour 1
the 1
turk 1
amazed 1
and 1
delighted 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
kindle 1
the 1
zeal 1
of 1
his 1
deliverer 1
by 1
promises 1
of 1
reward 1
and 1
wealth 1
felix 1
rejected 1
his 1
offers 1
with 1
contempt 1
yet 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
lovely 1
safie 1
who 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
visit 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
who 1
by 1
her 1
gestures 1
expressed 1
her 1
lively 1
gratitude 1
the 1
youth 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
owning 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
the 1
captive 1
possessed 1
a 1
treasure 1
which 1
would 1
fully 1
reward 1
his 1
toil 1
and 1
hazard 1
the 1
turk 1
quickly 1
perceived 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
had 1
made 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
felix 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
secure 1
him 1
more 1
entirely 1
in 1
his 1
interests 1
by 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
her 1
hand 1
in 1
marriage 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
conveyed 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
safety 1
felix 1
was 1
too 1
delicate 1
to 1
accept 1
this 1
offer 1
yet 1
he 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
the 1
probability 1
of 1
the 1
event 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
his 1
happiness 1
during 1
the 1
ensuing 1
days 1
while 1
the 1
preparations 1
were 1
going 1
forward 1
for 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
the 1
merchant 1
the 1
zeal 1
of 1
felix 1
was 1
warmed 1
by 1
several 1
letters 1
that 1
he 1
received 1
from 1
this 1
lovely 1
girl 1
who 1
found 1
means 1
to 1
express 1
her 1
thoughts 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
a 1
servant 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
who 1
understood 1
french 1
she 1
thanked 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
ardent 1
terms 1
for 1
his 1
intended 1
services 1
towards 1
her 1
parent 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
she 1
gently 1
deplored 1
her 1
own 1
fate 1
i 1
have 1
copies 1
of 1
these 1
letters 1
for 1
i 1
found 1
means 1
during 1
my 1
residence 1
in 1
the 1
hovel 1
to 1
procure 1
the 1
implements 1
of 1
writing 1
and 1
the 1
letters 1
were 1
often 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
felix 1
or 1
agatha 1
before 1
i 1
depart 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
they 1
will 1
prove 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
my 1
tale 1
but 1
at 1
present 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
is 1
already 1
far 1
declined 1
i 1
shall 1
only 1
have 1
time 1
to 1
repeat 1
the 1
substance 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
safie 1
related 1
that 1
her 1
mother 1
was 1
a 1
christian 1
arab 1
seized 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
slave 1
by 1
the 1
turks 1
recommended 1
by 1
her 1
beauty 1
she 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1

in 1
high 1
and 1
enthusiastic 1
terms 1
of 1
her 1
mother 1

born 1
in 1
freedom 1
spurned 1
the 1

instructed 1
her 1

in 1
the 1

taught 1
her 1
to 1
aspire 1

this 1
lady 1
died 1
but 1
her 1
lessons 1
were 1
indelibly 1
impressed 1
on 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
safie 1
who 1
sickened 1
at 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
again 1
returning 1
to 1
asia 1
and 1
being 1
immured 1
within 1
the 1
walls 1

only 1
to 1

suited 1
to 1
the 1
temper 1
of 1
her 1
soul 1

accustomed 1
to 1
grand 1
ideas 1
and 1
a 1
noble 1
emulation 1
for 1
virtue 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
marrying 1
a 1
christian 1
and 1
remaining 1
in 1
a 1
country 1
where 1
women 1
were 1
allowed 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
rank 1
in 1
society 1
was 1
enchanting 1
to 1
her 1
the 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
the 1
turk 1
was 1
fixed 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
previous 1
to 1
it 1
he 1
quitted 1
his 1
prison 1
and 1
before 1
morning 1
was 1
distant 1
many 1
leagues 1
from 1
paris 1
felix 1
had 1
procured 1
passports 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
sister 1
and 1
himself 1
he 1
had 1
previously 1
communicated 1
his 1
plan 1
to 1
the 1
former 1
who 1
aided 1
the 1
deceit 1
by 1
quitting 1
his 1
house 1
under 1
the 1
pretence 1
of 1
a 1
journey 1
and 1
concealed 1
himself 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
in 1
an 1
obscure 1
part 1
of 1
paris 1
felix 1
conducted 1
the 1
fugitives 1
through 1
france 1
to 1
lyons 1
and 1
across 1
mont 1
cenis 1
to 1
leghorn 1
where 1
the 1
merchant 1
had 1
decided 1
to 1
wait 1
a 1
favourable 1
opportunity 1
of 1
passing 1
into 1
some 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
turkish 1
dominions 1
safie 1
resolved 1
to 1
remain 1
with 1
her 1
father 1
until 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
his 1
departure 1
before 1
which 1
time 1
the 1
turk 1
renewed 1
his 1
promise 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
united 1
to 1
his 1
deliverer 1
and 1
felix 1
remained 1
with 1
them 1
in 1
expectation 1
of 1
that 1
event 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
the 1
arabian 1
who 1
exhibited 1
towards 1
him 1
the 1
simplest 1
and 1
tenderest 1
affection 1
they 1
conversed 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
through 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
an 1
interpreter 1
and 1
sometimes 1
with 1
the 1
interpretation 1
of 1
looks 1
and 1
safie 1
sang 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
divine 1
airs 1
of 1
her 1
native 1
country 1
the 1
turk 1
allowed 1
this 1
intimacy 1
to 1
take 1
place 1
and 1
encouraged 1
the 1
hopes 1
of 1
the 1
youthful 1
lovers 1
while 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
far 1
other 1
plans 1
he 1
loathed 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
should 1
be 1
united 1
to 1
a 1
christian 1
but 1
he 1
feared 1
the 1
resentment 1
of 1
felix 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
appear 1
lukewarm 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
his 1
deliverer 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
choose 1
to 1
betray 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
italian 1
state 1
which 1
they 1
inhabited 1
he 1
revolved 1
a 1
thousand 1
plans 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
enabled 1
to 1
prolong 1
the 1
deceit 1
until 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
no 1
longer 1
necessary 1
and 1
secretly 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
daughter 1
with 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
departed 1
his 1
plans 1
were 1
facilitated 1
by 1
the 1
news 1
which 1
arrived 1
from 1
paris 1
the 1
government 1
of 1
france 1
were 1
greatly 1
enraged 1
at 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
their 1
victim 1
and 1
spared 1
no 1
pains 1
to 1
detect 1
and 1
punish 1
his 1
deliverer 1
the 1
plot 1
of 1
felix 1
was 1
quickly 1
discovered 1
and 1
de 1
lacey 1
and 1
agatha 1
were 1
thrown 1
into 1
prison 1
the 1
news 1
reached 1
felix 1
and 1
roused 1
him 1
from 1
his 1
dream 1
of 1
pleasure 1
his 1
blind 1
and 1
aged 1
father 1
and 1
his 1
gentle 1
sister 1
lay 1
in 1
a 1
noisome 1
dungeon 1
while 1
he 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
free 1
air 1
and 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
her 1
whom 1
he 1
loved 1
this 1
idea 1
was 1
torture 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
quickly 1
arranged 1
with 1
the 1
turk 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
latter 1
should 1
find 1
a 1
favourable 1
opportunity 1
for 1
escape 1
before 1
felix 1
could 1
return 1
to 1
italy 1
safie 1
should 1
remain 1
as 1
a 1
boarder 1
at 1
a 1
convent 1
at 1
leghorn 1
and 1
then 1
quitting 1
the 1
lovely 1
arabian 1
he 1
hastened 1
to 1
paris 1
and 1
delivered 1
himself 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
vengeance 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
hoping 1
to 1
free 1
de 1
lacey 1
and 1
agatha 1
by 1
this 1
proceeding 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
succeed 1
they 1
remained 1
confined 1
for 1
five 1
months 1
before 1
the 1
trial 1
took 1
place 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
which 1
deprived 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
fortune 1
and 1
condemned 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
perpetual 1
exile 1
from 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
miserable 1
asylum 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
germany 1
where 1
i 1
discovered 1
them 1
felix 1
soon 1
learned 1
that 1
the 1
treacherous 1
turk 1
for 1
whom 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
family 1
endured 1
such 1
unheard 1
of 1
oppression 1
on 1
discovering 1
that 1
his 1
deliverer 1
was 1
thus 1
reduced 1
to 1
poverty 1
and 1
ruin 1
became 1
a 1
traitor 1
to 1
good 1
feeling 1
and 1
honour 1
and 1
had 1
quitted 1
italy 1
with 1
his 1
daughter 1
insultingly 1
sending 1
felix 1
a 1
pittance 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
aid 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
some 1
plan 1
of 1
future 1
maintenance 1
such 1
were 1
the 1
events 1
that 1
preyed 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
felix 1
and 1
rendered 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
him 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
endured 1
poverty 1
and 1
while 1
this 1
distress 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
meed 1
of 1
his 1
virtue 1
he 1
gloried 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
ingratitude 1
of 1
the 1
turk 1
and 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
his 1
beloved 1
safie 1
were 1
misfortunes 1
more 1
bitter 1
and 1
irreparable 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
the 1
arabian 1
now 1
infused 1
new 1
life 1
into 1
his 1
soul 1
when 1
the 1
news 1
reached 1
leghorn 1
that 1
felix 1
was 1
deprived 1
of 1
his 1
wealth 1
and 1
rank 1
the 1
merchant 1
commanded 1
his 1
daughter 1
to 1
think 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
but 1
to 1
prepare 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
her 1
native 1
country 1
the 1
generous 1
nature 1
of 1
safie 1
was 1
outraged 1
by 1
this 1
command 1
she 1
attempted 1
to 1
expostulate 1
with 1
her 1
father 1
but 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
angrily 1
reiterating 1
his 1
tyrannical 1
mandate 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
after 1
the 1
turk 1
entered 1
his 1
daughter 1
s 1
apartment 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
hastily 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
his 1
residence 1
at 1
leghorn 1
had 1
been 1
divulged 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
speedily 1
be 1
delivered 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
french 1
government 1
he 1
had 1
consequently 1
hired 1
a 1
vessel 1
to 1
convey 1
him 1
to 1
constantinople 1
for 1
which 1
city 1
he 1
should 1
sail 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
he 1
intended 1
to 1
leave 1
his 1
daughter 1
under 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
a 1
confidential 1
servant 1
to 1
follow 1
at 1
her 1
leisure 1
with 1
the 1
greater 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
property 1
which 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
arrived 1
at 1
leghorn 1
when 1
alone 1
safie 1
resolved 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
mind 1
the 1
plan 1
of 1
conduct 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
become 1
her 1
to 1
pursue 1
in 1
this 1
emergency 1
a 1
residence 1
in 1
turkey 1
was 1
abhorrent 1
to 1
her 1
her 1
religion 1
and 1
her 1
feelings 1
were 1
alike 1
averse 1
to 1
it 1
by 1
some 1
papers 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
which 1
fell 1
into 1
her 1
hands 1
she 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
exile 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
and 1
learnt 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
then 1
resided 1
she 1
hesitated 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
formed 1
her 1
determination 1
taking 1
with 1
her 1
some 1
jewels 1
that 1
belonged 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
a 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
she 1
quitted 1
italy 1
with 1
an 1
attendant 1
a 1
native 1
of 1
leghorn 1
but 1
who 1
understood 1
the 1
common 1
language 1
of 1
turkey 1
and 1
departed 1
for 1
germany 1
she 1
arrived 1
in 1
safety 1
at 1
a 1
town 1
about 1
twenty 1
leagues 1
from 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
de 1
lacey 1
when 1
her 1
attendant 1
fell 1
dangerously 1
ill 1
safie 1
nursed 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
most 1
devoted 1
affection 1
but 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
died 1
and 1
the 1
arabian 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
utterly 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
customs 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
she 1
fell 1
however 1
into 1
good 1
hands 1
the 1
italian 1
had 1
mentioned 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
spot 1
for 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
bound 1
and 1
after 1
her 1
death 1
the 1
woman 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
lived 1
took 1
care 1
that 1
safie 1
should 1
arrive 1
in 1
safety 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
her 1
lover 1
chapter 1
15 1
such 1
was 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
cottagers 1
it 1
impressed 1
me 1
deeply 1
i 1
learned 1
from 1
the 1
views 1
of 1
social 1
life 1
which 1
it 1
developed 1
to 1
admire 1
their 1
virtues 1
and 1
to 1
deprecate 1
the 1
vices 1
of 1
mankind 1
as 1
yet 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
crime 1
as 1
a 1
distant 1
evil 1
benevolence 1
and 1
generosity 1
were 1
ever 1
present 1
before 1
me 1
inciting 1
within 1
me 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
become 1
an 1
actor 1
in 1
the 1
busy 1
scene 1
where 1
so 1
many 1
admirable 1
qualities 1
were 1
called 1
forth 1
and 1
displayed 1
but 1
in 1
giving 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
my 1
intellect 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
omit 1
a 1
circumstance 1
which 1
occurred 1
in 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
august 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
year 1
one 1
night 1
during 1
my 1
accustomed 1
visit 1
to 1
the 1
neighbouring 1
wood 1
where 1
i 1
collected 1
my 1
own 1
food 1
and 1
brought 1
home 1
firing 1
for 1
my 1
protectors 1
i 1
found 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
a 1
leathern 1
portmanteau 1
containing 1
several 1
articles 1
of 1
dress 1
and 1
some 1
books 1
i 1
eagerly 1
seized 1
the 1
prize 1
and 1
returned 1
with 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
hovel 1
fortunately 1
the 1
books 1
were 1
written 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
the 1
elements 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
acquired 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
they 1
consisted 1
of 1
paradise 1
lost 1
a 1
volume 1
of 1
plutarch 1
s 1
lives 1
and 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
werter 1
the 1
possession 1
of 1
these 1
treasures 1
gave 1
me 1
extreme 1
delight 1
i 1
now 1
continually 1
studied 1
and 1
exercised 1
my 1
mind 1
upon 1
these 1
histories 1
whilst 1
my 1
friends 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
their 1
ordinary 1
occupations 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
these 1
books 1
they 1
produced 1
in 1
me 1
an 1
infinity 1
of 1
new 1
images 1
and 1
feelings 1
that 1
sometimes 1
raised 1
me 1
to 1
ecstasy 1
but 1
more 1
frequently 1
sunk 1
me 1
into 1
the 1
lowest 1
dejection 1
in 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
werter 1
besides 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
its 1
simple 1
and 1
affecting 1
story 1
so 1
many 1
opinions 1
are 1
canvassed 1
and 1
so 1
many 1
lights 1
thrown 1
upon 1
what 1
had 1
hitherto 1
been 1
to 1
me 1
obscure 1
subjects 1
that 1
i 1
found 1
in 1
it 1
a 1
never 1
ending 1
source 1
of 1
speculation 1
and 1
astonishment 1
the 1
gentle 1
and 1
domestic 1
manners 1
it 1
described 1
combined 1
with 1
lofty 1
sentiments 1
and 1
feelings 1
which 1
had 1
for 1
their 1
object 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
self 1
accorded 1
well 1
with 1
my 1
experience 1
among 1
my 1
protectors 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
wants 1
which 1
were 1
forever 1
alive 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
bosom 1
but 1
i 1
thought 1
werter 1
himself 1
a 1
more 1
divine 1
being 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
beheld 1
or 1
imagined 1
his 1
character 1
contained 1
no 1
pretension 1
but 1
it 1
sank 1
deep 1
the 1
disquisitions 1
upon 1
death 1
and 1
suicide 1
were 1
calculated 1
to 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
wonder 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
pretend 1
to 1
enter 1
into 1
the 1
merits 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
yet 1
i 1
inclined 1
towards 1
the 1
opinions 1
of 1
the 1
hero 1
whose 1
extinction 1
i 1
wept 1
without 1
precisely 1
understanding 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
read 1
however 1
i 1
applied 1
much 1
personally 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
feelings 1
and 1
condition 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
similar 1
yet 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
strangely 1
unlike 1
to 1
the 1
beings 1
concerning 1
whom 1
i 1
read 1
and 1
to 1
whose 1
conversation 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
listener 1
i 1
sympathized 1
with 1
and 1
partly 1
understood 1
them 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
unformed 1
in 1
mind 1
i 1
was 1
dependent 1
on 1
none 1
and 1
related 1
to 1
none 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
my 1
departure 1
was 1
free 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
none 1
to 1
lament 1
my 1
annihilation 1
my 1
person 1
was 1
hideous 1
and 1
my 1
stature 1
gigantic 1
what 1
did 1
this 1
mean 1
who 1
was 1
i 1
what 1
was 1
i 1
whence 1
did 1
i 1
come 1
what 1
was 1
my 1
destination 1
these 1
questions 1
continually 1
recurred 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
solve 1
them 1
the 1
volume 1
of 1
plutarch 1
s 1
lives 1
which 1
i 1
possessed 1
contained 1
the 1
histories 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
founders 1
of 1
the 1
ancient 1
republics 1
this 1
book 1
had 1
a 1
far 1
different 1
effect 1
upon 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sorrows 1
of 1
werter 1
i 1
learned 1
from 1
werter 1
s 1
imaginations 1
despondency 1
and 1
gloom 1
but 1
plutarch 1
taught 1
me 1
high 1
thoughts 1
he 1
elevated 1
me 1
above 1
the 1
wretched 1
sphere 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
reflections 1
to 1
admire 1
and 1
love 1
the 1
heroes 1
of 1
past 1
ages 1
many 1
things 1
i 1
read 1
surpassed 1
my 1
understanding 1
and 1
experience 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
confused 1
knowledge 1
of 1
kingdoms 1
wide 1
extents 1
of 1
country 1
mighty 1
rivers 1
and 1
boundless 1
seas 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
perfectly 1
unacquainted 1
with 1
towns 1
and 1
large 1
assemblages 1
of 1
men 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
only 1
school 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
studied 1
human 1
nature 1
but 1
this 1
book 1
developed 1
new 1
and 1
mightier 1
scenes 1
of 1
action 1
i 1
read 1
of 1
men 1
concerned 1
in 1
public 1
affairs 1
governing 1
or 1
massacring 1
their 1
species 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
greatest 1
ardour 1
for 1
virtue 1
rise 1
within 1
me 1
and 1
abhorrence 1
for 1
vice 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
understood 1
the 1
signification 1
of 1
those 1
terms 1
relative 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
as 1
i 1
applied 1
them 1
to 1
pleasure 1
and 1
pain 1
alone 1
induced 1
by 1
these 1
feelings 1
i 1
was 1
of 1
course 1
led 1
to 1
admire 1
peaceable 1
lawgivers 1
numa 1
solon 1
and 1
lycurgus 1
in 1
preference 1
to 1
romulus 1
and 1
theseus 1
the 1
patriarchal 1
lives 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
caused 1
these 1
impressions 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
firm 1
hold 1
on 1
my 1
mind 1
perhaps 1
if 1
my 1
first 1
introduction 1
to 1
humanity 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
by 1
a 1
young 1
soldier 1
burning 1
for 1
glory 1
and 1
slaughter 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
imbued 1
with 1
different 1
sensations 1
but 1
paradise 1
lost 1
excited 1
different 1
and 1
far 1
deeper 1
emotions 1
i 1
read 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
read 1
the 1
other 1
volumes 1
which 1
had 1
fallen 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
as 1
a 1
true 1
history 1
it 1
moved 1
every 1
feeling 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
awe 1
that 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
an 1
omnipotent 1
god 1
warring 1
with 1
his 1
creatures 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
exciting 1
i 1
often 1
referred 1
the 1
several 1
situations 1
as 1
their 1
similarity 1
struck 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
like 1
adam 1
i 1
was 1
apparently 1
united 1
by 1
no 1
link 1
to 1
any 1
other 1
being 1
in 1
existence 1
but 1
his 1
state 1
was 1
far 1
different 1
from 1
mine 1
in 1
every 1
other 1
respect 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
forth 1
from 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
god 1
a 1
perfect 1
creature 1
happy 1
and 1
prosperous 1
guarded 1
by 1
the 1
especial 1
care 1
of 1
his 1
creator 1
he 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
converse 1
with 1
and 1
acquire 1
knowledge 1
from 1
beings 1
of 1
a 1
superior 1
nature 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
wretched 1
helpless 1
and 1
alone 1
many 1
times 1
i 1
considered 1
satan 1
as 1
the 1
fitter 1
emblem 1
of 1
my 1
condition 1
for 1
often 1
like 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
viewed 1
the 1
bliss 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
the 1
bitter 1
gall 1
of 1
envy 1
rose 1
within 1
me 1
another 1
circumstance 1
strengthened 1
and 1
confirmed 1
these 1
feelings 1
soon 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
in 1
the 1
hovel 1
i 1
discovered 1
some 1
papers 1
in 1
the 1
pocket 1
of 1
the 1
dress 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
from 1
your 1
laboratory 1
at 1
first 1
i 1
had 1
neglected 1
them 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
decipher 1
the 1
characters 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
written 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
study 1
them 1
with 1
diligence 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
journal 1
of 1
the 1
four 1
months 1
that 1
preceded 1
my 1
creation 1
you 1
minutely 1
described 1
in 1
these 1
papers 1
every 1
step 1
you 1
took 1
in 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
your 1
work 1
this 1
history 1
was 1
mingled 1
with 1
accounts 1
of 1
domestic 1
occurrences 1
you 1
doubtless 1
recollect 1
these 1
papers 1
here 1
they 1
are 1
everything 1
is 1
related 1
in 1
them 1
which 1
bears 1
reference 1
to 1
my 1
accursed 1
origin 1
the 1
whole 1
detail 1
of 1
that 1
series 1
of 1
disgusting 1
circumstances 1
which 1
produced 1
it 1
is 1
set 1
in 1
view 1
the 1
minutest 1
description 1
of 1
my 1
odious 1
and 1
loathsome 1
person 1
is 1
given 1
in 1
language 1
which 1
painted 1
your 1
own 1
horrors 1
and 1
rendered 1
mine 1
indelible 1
i 1
sickened 1
as 1
i 1
read 1
hateful 1
day 1
when 1
i 1
received 1
life 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
in 1
agony 1
accursed 1
creator 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
form 1
a 1
monster 1
so 1
hideous 1
that 1
even 1
you 1
turned 1
from 1
me 1
in 1
disgust 1
god 1
in 1
pity 1
made 1
man 1
beautiful 1
and 1
alluring 1
after 1
his 1
own 1
image 1
but 1
my 1
form 1
is 1
a 1
filthy 1
type 1
of 1
yours 1
more 1
horrid 1
even 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
resemblance 1
satan 1
had 1
his 1
companions 1
fellow 1
devils 1
to 1
admire 1
and 1
encourage 1
him 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
solitary 1
and 1
abhorred 1
these 1
were 1
the 1
reflections 1
of 1
my 1
hours 1
of 1
despondency 1
and 1
solitude 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
contemplated 1
the 1
virtues 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
their 1
amiable 1
and 1
benevolent 1
dispositions 1
i 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
that 1
when 1
they 1
should 1
become 1
acquainted 1
with 1
my 1
admiration 1
of 1
their 1
virtues 1
they 1
would 1
compassionate 1
me 1
and 1
overlook 1
my 1
personal 1
deformity 1
could 1
they 1
turn 1
from 1
their 1
door 1
one 1
however 1
monstrous 1
who 1
solicited 1
their 1
compassion 1
and 1
friendship 1
i 1
resolved 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
to 1
despair 1
but 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
to 1
fit 1
myself 1
for 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
them 1
which 1
would 1
decide 1
my 1
fate 1
i 1
postponed 1
this 1
attempt 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
longer 1
for 1
the 1
importance 1
attached 1
to 1
its 1
success 1
inspired 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
dread 1
lest 1
i 1
should 1
fail 1
besides 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
my 1
understanding 1
improved 1
so 1
much 1
with 1
every 1
day 1
s 1
experience 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
unwilling 1
to 1
commence 1
this 1
undertaking 1
until 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
months 1
should 1
have 1
added 1
to 1
my 1
sagacity 1
several 1
changes 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
took 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
safie 1
diffused 1
happiness 1
among 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
i 1
also 1
found 1
that 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
of 1
plenty 1
reigned 1
there 1
felix 1
and 1
agatha 1
spent 1
more 1
time 1
in 1
amusement 1
and 1
conversation 1
and 1
were 1
assisted 1
in 1
their 1
labours 1
by 1
servants 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
rich 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
contented 1
and 1
happy 1
their 1
feelings 1
were 1
serene 1
and 1
peaceful 1
while 1
mine 1
became 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
tumultuous 1
increase 1
of 1
knowledge 1
only 1
discovered 1
to 1
me 1
more 1
clearly 1
what 1
a 1
wretched 1
outcast 1
i 1
was 1
i 1
cherished 1
hope 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
it 1
vanished 1
when 1
i 1
beheld 1
my 1
person 1
reflected 1
in 1
water 1
or 1
my 1
shadow 1
in 1
the 1
moonshine 1
even 1
as 1
that 1
frail 1
image 1
and 1
that 1
inconstant 1
shade 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
crush 1
these 1
fears 1
and 1
to 1
fortify 1
myself 1
for 1
the 1
trial 1
which 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
undergo 1
and 1
sometimes 1
i 1
allowed 1
my 1
thoughts 1
unchecked 1
by 1
reason 1
to 1
ramble 1
in 1
the 1
fields 1
of 1
paradise 1
and 1
dared 1
to 1
fancy 1
amiable 1
and 1
lovely 1
creatures 1
sympathizing 1
with 1
my 1
feelings 1
and 1
cheering 1
my 1
gloom 1
their 1
angelic 1
countenances 1
breathed 1
smiles 1
of 1
consolation 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
a 1
dream 1
no 1
eve 1
soothed 1
my 1
sorrows 1
nor 1
shared 1
my 1
thoughts 1
i 1
was 1
alone 1
i 1
remembered 1
adam 1
s 1
supplication 1
to 1
his 1
creator 1
but 1
where 1
was 1
mine 1
he 1
had 1
abandoned 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
bitterness 1
of 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
cursed 1
him 1
autumn 1
passed 1
thus 1
i 1
saw 1
with 1
surprise 1
and 1
grief 1
the 1
leaves 1
decay 1
and 1
fall 1
and 1
nature 1
again 1
assume 1
the 1
barren 1
and 1
bleak 1
appearance 1
it 1
had 1
worn 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
beheld 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
moon 1
yet 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
heed 1
the 1
bleakness 1
of 1
the 1
weather 1
i 1
was 1
better 1
fitted 1
by 1
my 1
conformation 1
for 1
the 1
endurance 1
of 1
cold 1
than 1
heat 1
but 1
my 1
chief 1
delights 1
were 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
flowers 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
gay 1
apparel 1
of 1
summer 1
when 1
those 1
deserted 1
me 1
i 1
turned 1
with 1
more 1
attention 1
towards 1
the 1
cottagers 1
their 1
happiness 1
was 1
not 1
decreased 1
by 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
summer 1
they 1
loved 1
and 1
sympathized 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
their 1
joys 1
depending 1
on 1
each 1
other 1
were 1
not 1
interrupted 1
by 1
the 1
casualties 1
that 1
took 1
place 1
around 1
them 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
saw 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
greater 1
became 1
my 1
desire 1
to 1
claim 1
their 1
protection 1
and 1
kindness 1
my 1
heart 1
yearned 1
to 1
be 1
known 1
and 1
loved 1
by 1
these 1
amiable 1
creatures 1
to 1
see 1
their 1
sweet 1
looks 1
directed 1
towards 1
me 1
with 1
affection 1
was 1
the 1
utmost 1
limit 1
of 1
my 1
ambition 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
turn 1
them 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
disdain 1
and 1
horror 1
the 1
poor 1
that 1
stopped 1
at 1
their 1
door 1
were 1
never 1
driven 1
away 1
i 1
asked 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
for 1
greater 1
treasures 1
than 1
a 1
little 1
food 1
or 1
rest 1
i 1
required 1
kindness 1
and 1
sympathy 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
believe 1
myself 1
utterly 1
unworthy 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
winter 1
advanced 1
and 1
an 1
entire 1
revolution 1
of 1
the 1
seasons 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
since 1
i 1
awoke 1
into 1
life 1
my 1
attention 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
was 1
solely 1
directed 1
towards 1
my 1
plan 1
of 1
introducing 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
i 1
revolved 1
many 1
projects 1
but 1
that 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
finally 1
fixed 1
was 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
dwelling 1
when 1
the 1
blind 1
old 1
man 1
should 1
be 1
alone 1
i 1
had 1
sagacity 1
enough 1
to 1
discover 1
that 1
the 1
unnatural 1
hideousness 1
of 1
my 1
person 1
was 1
the 1
chief 1
object 1
of 1
horror 1
with 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
formerly 1
beheld 1
me 1
my 1
voice 1
although 1
harsh 1
had 1
nothing 1
terrible 1
in 1
it 1
i 1
thought 1
therefore 1
that 1
if 1
in 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
his 1
children 1
i 1
could 1
gain 1
the 1
good 1
will 1
and 1
mediation 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
de 1
lacey 1
i 1
might 1
by 1
his 1
means 1
be 1
tolerated 1
by 1
my 1
younger 1
protectors 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
on 1
the 1
red 1
leaves 1
that 1
strewed 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
diffused 1
cheerfulness 1
although 1
it 1
denied 1
warmth 1
safie 1
agatha 1
and 1
felix 1
departed 1
on 1
a 1
long 1
country 1
walk 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
desire 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
cottage 1
when 1
his 1
children 1
had 1
departed 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
guitar 1
and 1
played 1
several 1
mournful 1
but 1
sweet 1
airs 1
more 1
sweet 1
and 1
mournful 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
him 1
play 1
before 1
at 1
first 1
his 1
countenance 1
was 1
illuminated 1
with 1
pleasure 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
continued 1
thoughtfulness 1
and 1
sadness 1
succeeded 1
at 1
length 1
laying 1
aside 1
the 1
instrument 1
he 1
sat 1
absorbed 1
in 1
reflection 1
my 1
heart 1
beat 1
quick 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
hour 1
and 1
moment 1
of 1
trial 1
which 1
would 1
decide 1
my 1
hopes 1
or 1
realize 1
my 1
fears 1
the 1
servants 1
were 1
gone 1
to 1
a 1
neighbouring 1
fair 1
all 1
was 1
silent 1
in 1
and 1
around 1
the 1
cottage 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
opportunity 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
proceeded 1
to 1
execute 1
my 1
plan 1
my 1
limbs 1
failed 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
again 1
i 1
rose 1
and 1
exerting 1
all 1
the 1
firmness 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
master 1
removed 1
the 1
planks 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
placed 1
before 1
my 1
hovel 1
to 1
conceal 1
my 1
retreat 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
revived 1
me 1
and 1
with 1
renewed 1
determination 1
i 1
approached 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
their 1
cottage 1
i 1
knocked 1
who 1
is 1
there 1
said 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
come 1
in 1
i 1
entered 1
pardon 1
this 1
intrusion 1
said 1
i 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
traveller 1
in 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
rest 1
you 1
would 1
greatly 1
oblige 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
remain 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
enter 1
said 1
de 1
lacey 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
try 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
i 1
can 1
to 1
relieve 1
your 1
wants 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
my 1
children 1
are 1
from 1
home 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
blind 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
shall 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
procure 1
food 1
for 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
trouble 1
yourself 1
my 1
kind 1
host 1
i 1
have 1
food 1
it 1
is 1
warmth 1
and 1
rest 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
need 1
i 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
a 1
silence 1
ensued 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
every 1
minute 1
was 1
precious 1
to 1
me 1
yet 1
i 1
remained 1
irresolute 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
to 1
commence 1
the 1
interview 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
addressed 1
me 1
by 1
your 1
language 1
stranger 1
i 1
suppose 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
countryman 1
are 1
you 1
french 1
no 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
educated 1
by 1
a 1
french 1
family 1
and 1
understand 1
that 1
language 1
only 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
going 1
to 1
claim 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
some 1
friends 1
whom 1
i 1
sincerely 1
love 1
and 1
of 1
whose 1
favour 1
i 1
have 1
some 1
hopes 1
are 1
they 1
germans 1
no 1
they 1
are 1
french 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
change 1
the 1
subject 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
deserted 1
creature 1
i 1
look 1
around 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
relation 1
or 1
friend 1
upon 1
earth 1
these 1
amiable 1
people 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
go 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
me 1
and 1
know 1
little 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
full 1
of 1
fears 1
for 1
if 1
i 1
fail 1
there 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
outcast 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
forever 1
do 1
not 1
despair 1
to 1
be 1
friendless 1
is 1
indeed 1
to 1
be 1
unfortunate 1
but 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
men 1
when 1
unprejudiced 1
by 1
any 1
obvious 1
self 1
interest 1
are 1
full 1
of 1
brotherly 1
love 1
and 1
charity 1
rely 1
therefore 1
on 1
your 1
hopes 1
and 1
if 1
these 1
friends 1
are 1
good 1
and 1
amiable 1
do 1
not 1
despair 1
they 1
are 1
kind 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
most 1
excellent 1
creatures 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
unfortunately 1
they 1
are 1
prejudiced 1
against 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
good 1
dispositions 1
my 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
hitherto 1
harmless 1
and 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
beneficial 1
but 1
a 1
fatal 1
prejudice 1
clouds 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
where 1
they 1
ought 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
feeling 1
and 1
kind 1
friend 1
they 1
behold 1
only 1
a 1
detestable 1
monster 1
that 1
is 1
indeed 1
unfortunate 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
blameless 1
cannot 1
you 1
undeceive 1
them 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
undertake 1
that 1
task 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
that 1
i 1
feel 1
so 1
many 1
overwhelming 1
terrors 1
i 1
tenderly 1
love 1
these 1
friends 1
i 1
have 1
unknown 1
to 1
them 1
been 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
in 1
the 1
habits 1
of 1
daily 1
kindness 1
towards 1
them 1
but 1
they 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
injure 1
them 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
prejudice 1
which 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
overcome 1
where 1
do 1
these 1
friends 1
reside 1
near 1
this 1
spot 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
paused 1
and 1
then 1
continued 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
unreservedly 1
confide 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
your 1
tale 1
i 1
perhaps 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
in 1
undeceiving 1
them 1
i 1
am 1
blind 1
and 1
cannot 1
judge 1
of 1
your 1
countenance 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
your 1
words 1
which 1
persuades 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
sincere 1
i 1
am 1
poor 1
and 1
an 1
exile 1
but 1
it 1
will 1
afford 1
me 1
true 1
pleasure 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
any 1
way 1
serviceable 1
to 1
a 1
human 1
creature 1
excellent 1
man 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
and 1
accept 1
your 1
generous 1
offer 1
you 1
raise 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
dust 1
by 1
this 1
kindness 1
and 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
by 1
your 1
aid 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
driven 1
from 1
the 1
society 1
and 1
sympathy 1
of 1
your 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
heaven 1
forbid 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
really 1
criminal 1
for 1
that 1
can 1
only 1
drive 1
you 1
to 1
desperation 1
and 1
not 1
instigate 1
you 1
to 1
virtue 1
i 1
also 1
am 1
unfortunate 1
i 1
and 1
my 1
family 1
have 1
been 1
condemned 1
although 1
innocent 1
judge 1
therefore 1
if 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
feel 1
for 1
your 1
misfortunes 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
my 1
best 1
and 1
only 1
benefactor 1
from 1
your 1
lips 1
first 1
have 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
kindness 1
directed 1
towards 1
me 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
forever 1
grateful 1
and 1
your 1
present 1
humanity 1
assures 1
me 1
of 1
success 1
with 1
those 1
friends 1
whom 1
i 1
am 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
meeting 1
may 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
and 1
residence 1
of 1
those 1
friends 1
i 1
paused 1
this 1
i 1
thought 1
was 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
decision 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
rob 1
me 1
of 1
or 1
bestow 1
happiness 1
on 1
me 1
forever 1
i 1
struggled 1
vainly 1
for 1
firmness 1
sufficient 1
to 1
answer 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
effort 1
destroyed 1
all 1
my 1
remaining 1
strength 1
i 1
sank 1
on 1
the 1
chair 1
and 1
sobbed 1
aloud 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
my 1
younger 1
protectors 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
lose 1
but 1
seizing 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
i 1
cried 1
now 1
is 1
the 1
time 1
save 1
and 1
protect 1
me 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
family 1
are 1
the 1
friends 1
whom 1
i 1
seek 1
do 1
not 1
you 1
desert 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1

unable 1

to 1
her 1
friend 1
rushed 1
out 1
of 1
the 1

felix 1
darted 1
forward 1
and 1
with 1
supernatural 1
force 1
tore 1
me 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
to 1
whose 1
knees 1
i 1
clung 1
in 1
a 1

dashed 1
me 1
to 1
the 1

struck 1
me 1
violently 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
torn 1
him 1
limb 1
from 1
limb 1
as 1

my 1

sank 1
within 1
me 1
as 1
with 1
bitter 1
sickness 1
and 1
i 1
refrained 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
repeating 1
his 1
blow 1
when 1
overcome 1
by 1
pain 1
and 1
anguish 1
i 1
quitted 1
the 1
cottage 1

not 1
extinguish 1
the 1
spark 1
of 1
existence 1
which 1
you 1
had 1

not 1

me 1
my 1
feelings 1

those 1
of 1
rage 1
and 1
revenge 1
i 1
could 1
with 1
pleasure 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1

and 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
and 1
have 1
glutted 1
myself 1
with 1
their 1
shrieks 1
and 1
misery 1
when 1
night 1
came 1
i 1
quitted 1
my 1
retreat 1
and 1
wandered 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
and 1
now 1
no 1
longer 1
restrained 1
by 1
the 1
fear 1
of 1
discovery 1
i 1
gave 1
vent 1
to 1
my 1
anguish 1
in 1
fearful 1
howlings 1
i 1
was 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
beast 1
that 1
had 1
broken 1
the 1
toils 1
destroying 1
the 1
objects 1
that 1
obstructed 1
me 1
and 1
ranging 1
through 1
the 1
wood 1
with 1
a 1
stag 1
like 1
swiftness 1
oh 1
what 1
a 1
miserable 1
night 1
i 1
passed 1
the 1
cold 1
stars 1
shone 1
in 1
mockery 1
and 1
the 1
bare 1
trees 1
waved 1
their 1
branches 1
above 1
me 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
sweet 1
voice 1
of 1
a 1
bird 1
burst 1
forth 1
amidst 1
the 1
universal 1
stillness 1
all 1
save 1
i 1
were 1
at 1
rest 1
or 1
in 1
enjoyment 1
i 1
like 1
the 1
arch 1
fiend 1
bore 1
a 1
hell 1
within 1
me 1
and 1
finding 1
myself 1
unsympathized 1
with 1
wished 1
to 1
tear 1
up 1
the 1
trees 1
spread 1
havoc 1
and 1
destruction 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
have 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
ruin 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
luxury 1
of 1
sensation 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
i 1
became 1
fatigued 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
bodily 1
exertion 1
and 1
sank 1
on 1
the 1
damp 1
grass 1
in 1
the 1
sick 1
impotence 1
of 1
despair 1
there 1
was 1
none 1
among 1
the 1
myriads 1
of 1
men 1
that 1
existed 1
who 1
would 1
pity 1
or 1
assist 1
me 1
and 1
should 1
i 1
feel 1
kindness 1
towards 1
my 1
enemies 1
no 1
from 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
declared 1
everlasting 1
war 1
against 1
the 1
species 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
against 1
him 1
who 1
had 1
formed 1
me 1
and 1
sent 1
me 1
forth 1
to 1
this 1
insupportable 1
misery 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
voices 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
retreat 1
during 1
that 1
day 1
accordingly 1
i 1
hid 1
myself 1
in 1
some 1
thick 1
underwood 1
determining 1
to 1
devote 1
the 1
ensuing 1
hours 1
to 1
reflection 1
on 1
my 1
situation 1
the 1
pleasant 1
sunshine 1
and 1
the 1
pure 1
air 1
of 1
day 1
restored 1
me 1
to 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
considered 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
at 1
the 1
cottage 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
believing 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
too 1
hasty 1
in 1
my 1
conclusions 1
i 1
had 1
certainly 1
acted 1
imprudently 1
it 1
was 1
apparent 1
that 1
my 1
conversation 1
had 1
interested 1
the 1
father 1
in 1
my 1
behalf 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
fool 1
in 1
having 1
exposed 1
my 1
person 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
his 1
children 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
familiarized 1
the 1
old 1
de 1
lacey 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
by 1
degrees 1
to 1
have 1
discovered 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
family 1
when 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
prepared 1
for 1
my 1
approach 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
believe 1
my 1
errors 1
to 1
be 1
irretrievable 1
and 1
after 1
much 1
consideration 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
seek 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
by 1
my 1
representations 1
win 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
party 1
these 1
thoughts 1
calmed 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
i 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
profound 1
sleep 1
but 1
the 1
fever 1
of 1
my 1
blood 1
did 1
not 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
visited 1
by 1
peaceful 1
dreams 1
the 1
horrible 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
day 1
was 1
forever 1
acting 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
females 1
were 1
flying 1
and 1
the 1
enraged 1
felix 1
tearing 1
me 1
from 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
feet 1
i 1
awoke 1
exhausted 1
and 1
finding 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
night 1
i 1
crept 1
forth 1
from 1
my 1
hiding 1
place 1
and 1
went 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
food 1
when 1
my 1
hunger 1
was 1
appeased 1
i 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
towards 1
the 1
well 1
known 1
path 1
that 1
conducted 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
all 1
there 1
was 1
at 1
peace 1
i 1
crept 1
into 1
my 1
hovel 1
and 1
remained 1
in 1
silent 1
expectation 1
of 1
the 1
accustomed 1
hour 1
when 1
the 1
family 1
arose 1
that 1
hour 1
passed 1
the 1
sun 1
mounted 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
but 1
the 1
cottagers 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
i 1
trembled 1
violently 1
apprehending 1
some 1
dreadful 1
misfortune 1
the 1
inside 1
of 1
the 1
cottage 1
was 1
dark 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
no 1
motion 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
this 1
suspense 1
presently 1
two 1
countrymen 1
passed 1
by 1
but 1
pausing 1
near 1
the 1
cottage 1
they 1
entered 1
into 1
conversation 1
using 1
violent 1
gesticulations 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
as 1
they 1
spoke 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
which 1
differed 1
from 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
protectors 1
soon 1
after 1
however 1
felix 1
approached 1
with 1
another 1
man 1
i 1
was 1
surprised 1
as 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
quitted 1
the 1
cottage 1
that 1
morning 1
and 1
waited 1
anxiously 1
to 1
discover 1
from 1
his 1
discourse 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
these 1
unusual 1
appearances 1
do 1
you 1
consider 1
said 1
his 1
companion 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
obliged 1
to 1
pay 1
three 1
months 1
rent 1
and 1
to 1
lose 1
the 1
produce 1
of 1
your 1
garden 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
take 1
any 1
unfair 1
advantage 1
and 1
i 1
beg 1
therefore 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
take 1
some 1
days 1
to 1
consider 1
of 1
your 1
determination 1
it 1
is 1
utterly 1
useless 1
replied 1
felix 1
we 1
can 1
never 1
again 1
inhabit 1
your 1
cottage 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
greatest 1
danger 1
owing 1
to 1
the 1
dreadful 1
circumstance 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
related 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
my 1
sister 1
will 1
never 1
recover 1
from 1
their 1
horror 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
reason 1
with 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
take 1
possession 1
of 1
your 1
tenement 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
fly 1
from 1
this 1
place 1
felix 1
trembled 1
violently 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
entered 1
the 1
cottage 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
remained 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
and 1
then 1
departed 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
de 1
lacey 1
more 1
i 1
continued 1
for 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
in 1
my 1
hovel 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
utter 1
and 1
stupid 1
despair 1
my 1
protectors 1
had 1
departed 1
and 1
had 1
broken 1
the 1
only 1
link 1
that 1
held 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
revenge 1
and 1
hatred 1
filled 1
my 1
bosom 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
strive 1
to 1
control 1
them 1
but 1
allowing 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
the 1
stream 1
i 1
bent 1
my 1
mind 1
towards 1
injury 1
and 1
death 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
of 1
the 1
mild 1
voice 1
of 1
de 1
lacey 1
the 1
gentle 1
eyes 1
of 1
agatha 1
and 1
the 1
exquisite 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
arabian 1
these 1
thoughts 1
vanished 1
and 1
a 1
gush 1
of 1
tears 1
somewhat 1
soothed 1
me 1
but 1
again 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
spurned 1
and 1
deserted 1
me 1
anger 1
returned 1
a 1
rage 1
of 1
anger 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
injure 1
anything 1
human 1
i 1
turned 1
my 1
fury 1
towards 1
inanimate 1
objects 1
as 1
night 1
advanced 1
i 1
placed 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
combustibles 1
around 1
the 1
cottage 1
and 1
after 1
having 1
destroyed 1
every 1
vestige 1
of 1
cultivation 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
i 1
waited 1
with 1
forced 1
impatience 1
until 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
sunk 1
to 1
commence 1
my 1
operations 1
as 1
the 1
night 1
advanced 1
a 1
fierce 1
wind 1
arose 1
from 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
quickly 1
dispersed 1
the 1
clouds 1
that 1
had 1
loitered 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
the 1
blast 1
tore 1
along 1
like 1
a 1
mighty 1
avalanche 1
and 1
produced 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
insanity 1
in 1
my 1
spirits 1
that 1
burst 1
all 1
bounds 1
of 1
reason 1
and 1
reflection 1
i 1
lighted 1
the 1
dry 1
branch 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
danced 1
with 1
fury 1
around 1
the 1
devoted 1
cottage 1
my 1
eyes 1
still 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
western 1
horizon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
moon 1
nearly 1
touched 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
its 1
orb 1
was 1
at 1
length 1
hid 1
and 1
i 1
waved 1
my 1
brand 1
it 1
sank 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
loud 1
scream 1
i 1
fired 1
the 1
straw 1
and 1
heath 1
and 1
bushes 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
collected 1
the 1
wind 1
fanned 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
the 1
cottage 1
was 1
quickly 1
enveloped 1
by 1
the 1
flames 1
which 1
clung 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
licked 1
it 1
with 1
their 1
forked 1
and 1
destroying 1
tongues 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
no 1
assistance 1
could 1
save 1
any 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
habitation 1
i 1
quitted 1
the 1
scene 1
and 1
sought 1
for 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
now 1
with 1
the 1
world 1
before 1
me 1
whither 1
should 1
i 1
bend 1
my 1
steps 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
fly 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
hated 1
and 1
despised 1
every 1
country 1
must 1
be 1
equally 1
horrible 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
you 1
crossed 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
learned 1
from 1
your 1
papers 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
my 1
father 1
my 1
creator 1
and 1
to 1
whom 1
could 1
i 1
apply 1
with 1
more 1
fitness 1
than 1
to 1
him 1
who 1
had 1
given 1
me 1
life 1
among 1
the 1
lessons 1
that 1
felix 1
had 1
bestowed 1
upon 1
safie 1
geography 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
omitted 1
i 1
had 1
learned 1
from 1
these 1
the 1
relative 1
situations 1
of 1
the 1
different 1
countries 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
you 1
had 1
mentioned 1
geneva 1
as 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
your 1
native 1
town 1
and 1
towards 1
this 1
place 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
proceed 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
i 1
to 1
direct 1
myself 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
travel 1
in 1
a 1
southwesterly 1
direction 1
to 1
reach 1
my 1
destination 1
but 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
my 1
only 1
guide 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
the 1
towns 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
nor 1
could 1
i 1
ask 1
information 1
from 1
a 1
single 1
human 1
being 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
despair 1
from 1
you 1
only 1
could 1
i 1
hope 1
for 1
succour 1
although 1
towards 1
you 1
i 1
felt 1
no 1
sentiment 1
but 1
that 1
of 1
hatred 1
unfeeling 1
heartless 1
creator 1
you 1
had 1
endowed 1
me 1
with 1
perceptions 1
and 1
passions 1
and 1
then 1
cast 1
me 1
abroad 1
an 1
object 1
for 1
the 1
scorn 1
and 1
horror 1
of 1
mankind 1
but 1
on 1
you 1
only 1
had 1
i 1
any 1
claim 1
for 1
pity 1
and 1
redress 1
and 1
from 1
you 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
seek 1
that 1
justice 1
which 1
i 1
vainly 1
attempted 1
to 1
gain 1
from 1
any 1
other 1
being 1
that 1
wore 1
the 1
human 1
form 1
my 1
travels 1
were 1
long 1
and 1
the 1
sufferings 1
i 1
endured 1
intense 1
it 1
was 1
late 1
in 1
autumn 1
when 1
i 1
quitted 1
the 1
district 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
resided 1
i 1
travelled 1
only 1
at 1
night 1
fearful 1
of 1
encountering 1
the 1
visage 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
nature 1
decayed 1
around 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
became 1
heatless 1
rain 1
and 1
snow 1
poured 1
around 1
me 1
mighty 1
rivers 1
were 1
frozen 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
was 1
hard 1
and 1
chill 1
and 1
bare 1
and 1
i 1
found 1
no 1
shelter 1
oh 1
earth 1
how 1
often 1
did 1
i 1
imprecate 1
curses 1
on 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
the 1
mildness 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
had 1
fled 1
and 1
all 1
within 1
me 1
was 1
turned 1
to 1
gall 1
and 1
bitterness 1
the 1
nearer 1
i 1
approached 1
to 1
your 1
habitation 1
the 1
more 1
deeply 1
did 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
revenge 1
enkindled 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
snow 1
fell 1
and 1
the 1
waters 1
were 1
hardened 1
but 1
i 1
rested 1
not 1
a 1
few 1
incidents 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
directed 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
possessed 1
a 1
map 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
but 1
i 1
often 1
wandered 1
wide 1
from 1
my 1
path 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
feelings 1
allowed 1
me 1
no 1
respite 1
no 1
incident 1
occurred 1
from 1
which 1
my 1
rage 1
and 1
misery 1
could 1
not 1
extract 1
its 1
food 1
but 1
a 1
circumstance 1
that 1
happened 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
on 1
the 1
confines 1
of 1
switzerland 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
recovered 1
its 1
warmth 1
and 1
the 1
earth 1
again 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
green 1
confirmed 1
in 1
an 1
especial 1
manner 1
the 1
bitterness 1
and 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
feelings 1
i 1
generally 1
rested 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
travelled 1
only 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
secured 1
by 1
night 1
from 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
man 1
one 1
morning 1
however 1
finding 1
that 1
my 1
path 1
lay 1
through 1
a 1
deep 1
wood 1
i 1
ventured 1
to 1
continue 1
my 1
journey 1
after 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
risen 1
the 1
day 1
which 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
spring 1
cheered 1
even 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
loveliness 1
of 1
its 1
sunshine 1
and 1
the 1
balminess 1
of 1
the 1
air 1
i 1
felt 1
emotions 1
of 1
gentleness 1
and 1
pleasure 1
that 1
had 1
long 1
appeared 1
dead 1
revive 1
within 1
me 1
half 1
surprised 1
by 1
the 1
novelty 1
of 1
these 1
sensations 1
i 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
them 1
and 1
forgetting 1
my 1
solitude 1
and 1
deformity 1
dared 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
soft 1
tears 1
again 1
bedewed 1
my 1
cheeks 1
and 1
i 1
even 1
raised 1
my 1
humid 1
eyes 1
with 1
thankfulness 1
towards 1
the 1
blessed 1
sun 1
which 1
bestowed 1
such 1
joy 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
continued 1
to 1
wind 1
among 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
until 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
its 1
boundary 1
which 1
was 1
skirted 1
by 1
a 1
deep 1
and 1
rapid 1
river 1
into 1
which 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
bent 1
their 1
branches 1
now 1
budding 1
with 1
the 1
fresh 1
spring 1
here 1
i 1
paused 1
not 1
exactly 1
knowing 1
what 1
path 1
to 1
pursue 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
that 1
induced 1
me 1
to 1
conceal 1
myself 1
under 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
a 1
cypress 1
i 1
was 1
scarcely 1
hid 1
when 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
came 1
running 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
i 1
was 1
concealed 1
laughing 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
ran 1
from 1
someone 1
in 1
sport 1
she 1
continued 1
her 1
course 1
along 1
the 1
precipitous 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
when 1
suddenly 1
her 1
foot 1
slipped 1
and 1
she 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
rapid 1
stream 1
i 1
rushed 1
from 1
my 1
hiding 1
place 1
and 1
with 1
extreme 1
labour 1
from 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
saved 1
her 1
and 1
dragged 1
her 1
to 1
shore 1
she 1
was 1
senseless 1
and 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
every 1
means 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
restore 1
animation 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
suddenly 1
interrupted 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
a 1
rustic 1
who 1
was 1
probably 1
the 1
person 1
from 1
whom 1
she 1
had 1
playfully 1
fled 1
on 1
seeing 1
me 1
he 1
darted 1
towards 1
me 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
girl 1
from 1
my 1
arms 1
hastened 1
towards 1
the 1
deeper 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
wood 1
i 1
followed 1
speedily 1
i 1
hardly 1
knew 1
why 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
man 1
saw 1
me 1
draw 1
near 1
he 1
aimed 1
a 1
gun 1
which 1
he 1
carried 1
at 1
my 1
body 1
and 1
fired 1
i 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
my 1
injurer 1
with 1
increased 1
swiftness 1
escaped 1
into 1
the 1
wood 1
this 1
was 1
then 1
the 1
reward 1
of 1
my 1
benevolence 1
i 1
had 1
saved 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
from 1
destruction 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
recompense 1
i 1
now 1
writhed 1
under 1
the 1
miserable 1
pain 1
of 1
a 1
wound 1
which 1
shattered 1
the 1
flesh 1
and 1
bone 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
gentleness 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
entertained 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
before 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
hellish 1
rage 1
and 1
gnashing 1
of 1
teeth 1
inflamed 1
by 1
pain 1
i 1
vowed 1
eternal 1
hatred 1
and 1
vengeance 1
to 1
all 1
mankind 1
but 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
my 1
wound 1
overcame 1
me 1
my 1
pulses 1
paused 1
and 1
i 1
fainted 1
for 1
some 1
weeks 1
i 1
led 1
a 1
miserable 1
life 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
cure 1
the 1
wound 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
received 1
the 1
ball 1
had 1
entered 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
not 1
whether 1
it 1
had 1
remained 1
there 1
or 1
passed 1
through 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
means 1
of 1
extracting 1
it 1
my 1
sufferings 1
were 1
augmented 1
also 1
by 1
the 1
oppressive 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
injustice 1
and 1
ingratitude 1
of 1
their 1
infliction 1
my 1
daily 1
vows 1
rose 1
for 1
revenge 1
a 1
deep 1
and 1
deadly 1
revenge 1
such 1
as 1
would 1
alone 1
compensate 1
for 1
the 1
outrages 1
and 1
anguish 1
i 1
had 1
endured 1
after 1
some 1
weeks 1
my 1
wound 1
healed 1
and 1
i 1
continued 1
my 1
journey 1
the 1
labours 1
i 1
endured 1
were 1
no 1
longer 1
to 1
be 1
alleviated 1
by 1
the 1
bright 1
sun 1
or 1
gentle 1
breezes 1
of 1
spring 1
all 1
joy 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
mockery 1
which 1
insulted 1
my 1
desolate 1
state 1
and 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
more 1
painfully 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
enjoyment 1
of 1
pleasure 1
but 1
my 1
toils 1
now 1
drew 1
near 1
a 1
close 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
from 1
this 1
time 1
i 1
reached 1
the 1
environs 1
of 1
geneva 1
it 1
was 1
evening 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
and 1
i 1
retired 1
to 1
a 1
hiding 1
place 1
among 1
the 1
fields 1
that 1
surround 1
it 1
to 1
meditate 1
in 1
what 1
manner 1
i 1
should 1
apply 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
was 1
oppressed 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
hunger 1
and 1
far 1
too 1
unhappy 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
gentle 1
breezes 1
of 1
evening 1
or 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
the 1
sun 1
setting 1
behind 1
the 1
stupendous 1
mountains 1
of 1
jura 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
a 1
slight 1
sleep 1
relieved 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
pain 1
of 1
reflection 1
which 1
was 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
a 1
beautiful 1
child 1
who 1
came 1
running 1
into 1
the 1
recess 1
i 1
had 1
chosen 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
sportiveness 1
of 1
infancy 1
suddenly 1
as 1
i 1
gazed 1
on 1
him 1
an 1
idea 1
seized 1
me 1
that 1
this 1
little 1
creature 1
was 1
unprejudiced 1
and 1
had 1
lived 1
too 1
short 1
a 1
time 1
to 1
have 1
imbibed 1
a 1
horror 1
of 1
deformity 1
if 1
therefore 1
i 1
could 1
seize 1
him 1
and 1
educate 1
him 1
as 1
my 1
companion 1
and 1
friend 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
desolate 1
in 1
this 1
peopled 1
earth 1
urged 1
by 1
this 1
impulse 1
i 1
seized 1
on 1
the 1
boy 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
and 1
drew 1
him 1
towards 1
me 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
beheld 1
my 1
form 1
he 1
placed 1
his 1
hands 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
uttered 1
a 1
shrill 1
scream 1
i 1
drew 1
his 1
hand 1
forcibly 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
said 1
child 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
hurt 1
you 1
listen 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
struggled 1
violently 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
he 1
cried 1
monster 1
ugly 1
wretch 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
eat 1
me 1
and 1
tear 1
me 1
to 1
pieces 1
you 1
are 1
an 1
ogre 1
let 1
me 1
go 1

your 1
father 1
again 1
you 1

come 1
with 1
me 1
hideous 1
monster 1

papa 1

will 1
punish 1

not 1
keep 1
me 1
frankenstein 1
you 1

then 1
to 1
my 1
enemy 1
to 1
him 1
towards 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
sworn 1
eternal 1
revenge 1
you 1
shall 1
be 1
my 1
first 1
victim 1
the 1
child 1
still 1
struggled 1
and 1
loaded 1
me 1
with 1
epithets 1
which 1
carried 1
despair 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
grasped 1
his 1
throat 1
to 1
silence 1
him 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
lay 1
dead 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
i 1
gazed 1
on 1
my 1
victim 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
swelled 1
with 1
exultation 1
and 1
hellish 1
triumph 1
clapping 1
my 1
hands 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
i 1
too 1
can 1
create 1
desolation 1
my 1
enemy 1
is 1
not 1
invulnerable 1
this 1
death 1
will 1
carry 1
despair 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
thousand 1
other 1
miseries 1
shall 1
torment 1
and 1
destroy 1
him 1
as 1
i 1
fixed 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
child 1
i 1
saw 1
something 1
glittering 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
i 1
took 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
portrait 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
lovely 1
woman 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
my 1
malignity 1
it 1
softened 1
and 1
attracted 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
i 1
gazed 1
with 1
delight 1
on 1
her 1
dark 1
eyes 1
fringed 1
by 1
deep 1
lashes 1
and 1
her 1
lovely 1
lips 1
but 1
presently 1
my 1
rage 1
returned 1
i 1
remembered 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
forever 1
deprived 1
of 1
the 1
delights 1
that 1
such 1
beautiful 1
creatures 1
could 1
bestow 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
whose 1
resemblance 1
i 1
contemplated 1
would 1
in 1
regarding 1
me 1
have 1
changed 1
that 1
air 1
of 1
divine 1
benignity 1
to 1
one 1
expressive 1
of 1
disgust 1
and 1
affright 1
can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
such 1
thoughts 1
transported 1
me 1
with 1
rage 1
i 1
only 1
wonder 1
that 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
instead 1
of 1
venting 1
my 1
sensations 1
in 1
exclamations 1
and 1
agony 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
rush 1
among 1
mankind 1
and 1
perish 1
in 1
the 1
attempt 1
to 1
destroy 1
them 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
these 1
feelings 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
committed 1
the 1
murder 1
and 1
seeking 1
a 1
more 1
secluded 1
hiding 1
place 1
i 1
entered 1
a 1
barn 1
which 1
had 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
empty 1
a 1
woman 1
was 1
sleeping 1
on 1
some 1
straw 1
she 1
was 1
young 1
not 1
indeed 1
so 1
beautiful 1
as 1
her 1
whose 1
portrait 1
i 1
held 1
but 1
of 1
an 1
agreeable 1
aspect 1
and 1
blooming 1
in 1
the 1
loveliness 1
of 1
youth 1
and 1
health 1
here 1
i 1
thought 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
whose 1
joy 1
imparting 1
smiles 1
are 1
bestowed 1
on 1
all 1
but 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
bent 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
whispered 1
awake 1
fairest 1
thy 1
lover 1
is 1
near 1
he 1
who 1
would 1
give 1
his 1
life 1
but 1
to 1
obtain 1
one 1
look 1
of 1
affection 1
from 1
thine 1
eyes 1
my 1
beloved 1
awake 1
the 1
sleeper 1
stirred 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
terror 1
ran 1
through 1
me 1
should 1
she 1
indeed 1
awake 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
and 1
curse 1
me 1
and 1
denounce 1
the 1
murderer 1
thus 1
would 1
she 1
assuredly 1
act 1
if 1
her 1
darkened 1
eyes 1
opened 1
and 1
she 1
beheld 1
me 1
the 1
thought 1
was 1
madness 1
it 1
stirred 1
the 1
fiend 1
within 1
me 1
not 1
i 1
but 1
she 1
shall 1
suffer 1
the 1
murder 1
i 1
have 1
committed 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
forever 1
robbed 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
give 1
me 1
she 1
shall 1
atone 1
the 1
crime 1
had 1
its 1
source 1
in 1
her 1
be 1
hers 1
the 1
punishment 1
thanks 1
to 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
felix 1
and 1
the 1
sanguinary 1
laws 1
of 1
man 1
i 1
had 1
learned 1
now 1
to 1
work 1
mischief 1
i 1
bent 1
over 1
her 1
and 1
placed 1
the 1
portrait 1
securely 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
folds 1
of 1
her 1
dress 1
she 1
moved 1
again 1
and 1
i 1
fled 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
i 1
haunted 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
these 1
scenes 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
sometimes 1
wishing 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
sometimes 1
resolved 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
its 1
miseries 1
forever 1
at 1
length 1
i 1
wandered 1
towards 1
these 1
mountains 1
and 1
have 1
ranged 1
through 1
their 1
immense 1
recesses 1
consumed 1
by 1
a 1
burning 1
passion 1
which 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
gratify 1
we 1
may 1
not 1
part 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
promised 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
my 1
requisition 1
i 1
am 1
alone 1
and 1
miserable 1
man 1
will 1
not 1
associate 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
one 1
as 1
deformed 1
and 1
horrible 1
as 1
myself 1
would 1
not 1
deny 1
herself 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
companion 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
species 1
and 1
have 1
the 1
same 1
defects 1
this 1
being 1
you 1
must 1
create 1
chapter 1
17 1
the 1
being 1
finished 1
speaking 1
and 1
fixed 1
his 1
looks 1
upon 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
expectation 1
of 1
a 1
reply 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
bewildered 1
perplexed 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
arrange 1
my 1
ideas 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
full 1
extent 1
of 1
his 1
proposition 1
he 1
continued 1
you 1
must 1
create 1
a 1
female 1
for 1
me 1
with 1
whom 1
i 1
can 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
interchange 1
of 1
those 1
sympathies 1
necessary 1
for 1
my 1
being 1
this 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
do 1
and 1
i 1
demand 1
it 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
right 1
which 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
refuse 1
to 1
concede 1
the 1
latter 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
tale 1
had 1
kindled 1
anew 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
anger 1
that 1
had 1
died 1
away 1
while 1
he 1
narrated 1
his 1
peaceful 1
life 1
among 1
the 1
cottagers 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
i 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
suppress 1
the 1
rage 1
that 1
burned 1
within 1
me 1
i 1
do 1
refuse 1
it 1
i 1
replied 1
and 1
no 1
torture 1
shall 1
ever 1
extort 1
a 1
consent 1
from 1
me 1
you 1
may 1
render 1
me 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
men 1
but 1
you 1
shall 1
never 1
make 1
me 1
base 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
shall 1
i 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
yourself 1
whose 1
joint 1
wickedness 1
might 1
desolate 1
the 1
world 1
begone 1
i 1
have 1
answered 1
you 1
you 1
may 1
torture 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
never 1
consent 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
replied 1
the 1
fiend 1
and 1
instead 1
of 1
threatening 1
i 1
am 1
content 1
to 1
reason 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
am 1
malicious 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
miserable 1
am 1
i 1
not 1
shunned 1
and 1
hated 1
by 1
all 1
mankind 1
you 1
my 1
creator 1
would 1
tear 1
me 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
triumph 1
remember 1
that 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
pity 1
man 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
pities 1
me 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
call 1
it 1
murder 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
precipitate 1
me 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
ice 1
rifts 1
and 1
destroy 1
my 1
frame 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
hands 1
shall 1
i 1
respect 1
man 1
when 1
he 1
condemns 1
me 1
let 1
him 1
live 1
with 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
interchange 1
of 1
kindness 1
and 1
instead 1
of 1
injury 1
i 1
would 1
bestow 1
every 1
benefit 1
upon 1
him 1
with 1
tears 1
of 1
gratitude 1
at 1
his 1
acceptance 1
but 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
human 1
senses 1
are 1
insurmountable 1
barriers 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
yet 1
mine 1
shall 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
submission 1
of 1
abject 1
slavery 1
i 1
will 1
revenge 1
my 1
injuries 1
if 1
i 1
cannot 1
inspire 1
love 1
i 1
will 1
cause 1
fear 1
and 1
chiefly 1
towards 1
you 1
my 1
arch 1
enemy 1
because 1
my 1
creator 1
do 1
i 1
swear 1
inextinguishable 1
hatred 1
have 1
a 1
care 1
i 1
will 1
work 1
at 1
your 1
destruction 1
nor 1
finish 1
until 1
i 1
desolate 1
your 1
heart 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
shall 1
curse 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
your 1
birth 1
a 1
fiendish 1
rage 1
animated 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
this 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
wrinkled 1
into 1
contortions 1
too 1
horrible 1
for 1
human 1
eyes 1
to 1
behold 1
but 1
presently 1
he 1
calmed 1
himself 1
and 1
proceeded 1
i 1
intended 1
to 1
reason 1
this 1
passion 1
is 1
detrimental 1
to 1
me 1
for 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
reflect 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
its 1
excess 1
if 1
any 1
being 1
felt 1
emotions 1
of 1
benevolence 1
towards 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
return 1
them 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
a 1
hundredfold 1
for 1
that 1
one 1
creature 1
s 1
sake 1
i 1
would 1
make 1
peace 1
with 1
the 1
whole 1
kind 1
but 1
i 1
now 1
indulge 1
in 1
dreams 1
of 1
bliss 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
realized 1
what 1
i 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
is 1
reasonable 1
and 1
moderate 1
i 1
demand 1
a 1
creature 1
of 1
another 1
sex 1
but 1
as 1
hideous 1
as 1
myself 1
the 1
gratification 1
is 1
small 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
receive 1
and 1
it 1
shall 1
content 1
me 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
monsters 1
cut 1
off 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
but 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
more 1
attached 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
our 1
lives 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
happy 1
but 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
harmless 1
and 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
misery 1
i 1
now 1
feel 1
oh 1
my 1
creator 1
make 1
me 1
happy 1
let 1
me 1
feel 1
gratitude 1
towards 1
you 1
for 1
one 1
benefit 1
let 1
me 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
excite 1
the 1
sympathy 1
of 1
some 1
existing 1
thing 1
do 1
not 1
deny 1
me 1
my 1
request 1
i 1
was 1
moved 1
i 1
shuddered 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
possible 1
consequences 1
of 1
my 1
consent 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
justice 1
in 1
his 1
argument 1
his 1
tale 1
and 1
the 1
feelings 1
he 1
now 1
expressed 1
proved 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
creature 1
of 1
fine 1
sensations 1
and 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
as 1
his 1
maker 1
owe 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
portion 1
of 1
happiness 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
bestow 1
he 1
saw 1
my 1
change 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
continued 1
if 1
you 1
consent 1
neither 1
you 1
nor 1
any 1
other 1
human 1
being 1
shall 1
ever 1
see 1
us 1
again 1
i 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
vast 1
wilds 1
of 1
south 1
america 1
my 1
food 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
of 1
man 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
destroy 1
the 1
lamb 1
and 1
the 1
kid 1
to 1
glut 1
my 1
appetite 1
acorns 1
and 1
berries 1
afford 1
me 1
sufficient 1
nourishment 1
my 1
companion 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
nature 1
as 1
myself 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
content 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
fare 1
we 1
shall 1
make 1
our 1
bed 1
of 1
dried 1
leaves 1
the 1
sun 1
will 1
shine 1
on 1
us 1

on 1
man 1

will 1
ripen 1
our 1
food 1
the 1
picture 1
i 1
present 1
to 1
you 1
is 1
peaceful 1
and 1
human 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
feel 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
deny 1
it 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
wantonness 1
of 1
power 1
and 1
cruelty 1
pitiless 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
towards 1
me 1
i 1
now 1
see 1
compassion 1
in 1
your 1
eyes 1
let 1
me 1
seize 1
the 1
favourable 1
moment 1
and 1
persuade 1
you 1
to 1
promise 1
what 1
i 1
so 1
ardently 1
desire 1
you 1
propose 1
replied 1
i 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
the 1
habitations 1
of 1
man 1
to 1
dwell 1
in 1
those 1
wilds 1
where 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
field 1
will 1
be 1
your 1
only 1
companions 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
who 1
long 1
for 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
sympathy 1
of 1
man 1
persevere 1
in 1
this 1
exile 1
you 1
will 1
return 1
and 1
again 1
seek 1
their 1
kindness 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
meet 1
with 1
their 1
detestation 1
your 1
evil 1
passions 1
will 1
be 1
renewed 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
have 1
a 1
companion 1
to 1
aid 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
destruction 1
this 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
cease 1
to 1
argue 1
the 1
point 1
for 1
i 1
cannot 1
consent 1
how 1
inconstant 1
are 1
your 1
feelings 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
ago 1
you 1
were 1
moved 1
by 1
my 1
representations 1
and 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
again 1
harden 1
yourself 1
to 1
my 1
complaints 1
i 1
swear 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
the 1
earth 1
which 1
i 1
inhabit 1
and 1
by 1
you 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
that 1
with 1
the 1
companion 1
you 1
bestow 1
i 1
will 1
quit 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
dwell 1
as 1
it 1
may 1
chance 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
savage 1
of 1
places 1
my 1
evil 1
passions 1
will 1
have 1
fled 1
for 1
i 1
shall 1
meet 1
with 1
sympathy 1
my 1
life 1
will 1
flow 1
quietly 1
away 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
dying 1
moments 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
curse 1
my 1
maker 1
his 1
words 1
had 1
a 1
strange 1
effect 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
compassionated 1
him 1
and 1
sometimes 1
felt 1
a 1
wish 1
to 1
console 1
him 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
him 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
filthy 1
mass 1
that 1
moved 1
and 1
talked 1
my 1
heart 1
sickened 1
and 1
my 1
feelings 1
were 1
altered 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
hatred 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
stifle 1
these 1
sensations 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sympathize 1
with 1
him 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
withhold 1
from 1
him 1
the 1
small 1
portion 1
of 1
happiness 1
which 1
was 1
yet 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
bestow 1
you 1
swear 1
i 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
harmless 1
but 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
already 1
shown 1
a 1
degree 1
of 1
malice 1
that 1
should 1
reasonably 1
make 1
me 1
distrust 1
you 1
may 1
not 1
even 1
this 1
be 1
a 1
feint 1
that 1
will 1
increase 1
your 1
triumph 1
by 1
affording 1
a 1
wider 1
scope 1
for 1
your 1
revenge 1
how 1
is 1
this 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
trifled 1
with 1
and 1
i 1
demand 1
an 1
answer 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
ties 1
and 1
no 1
affections 1
hatred 1
and 1
vice 1
must 1
be 1
my 1
portion 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
another 1
will 1
destroy 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
my 1
crimes 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
become 1
a 1
thing 1
of 1
whose 1
existence 1
everyone 1
will 1
be 1
ignorant 1
my 1
vices 1
are 1
the 1
children 1
of 1
a 1
forced 1
solitude 1
that 1
i 1
abhor 1
and 1
my 1
virtues 1
will 1
necessarily 1
arise 1
when 1
i 1
live 1
in 1
communion 1
with 1
an 1
equal 1
i 1
shall 1
feel 1
the 1
affections 1
of 1
a 1
sensitive 1
being 1
and 1
become 1
linked 1
to 1
the 1
chain 1
of 1
existence 1
and 1
events 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
excluded 1
i 1
paused 1
some 1
time 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
all 1
he 1
had 1
related 1
and 1
the 1
various 1
arguments 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
employed 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
virtues 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
displayed 1
on 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
his 1
existence 1
and 1
the 1
subsequent 1
blight 1
of 1
all 1
kindly 1
feeling 1
by 1
the 1
loathing 1
and 1
scorn 1
which 1
his 1
protectors 1
had 1
manifested 1
towards 1
him 1
his 1
power 1
and 1
threats 1
were 1
not 1
omitted 1
in 1
my 1
calculations 1
a 1
creature 1
who 1
could 1
exist 1
in 1
the 1
ice 1
caves 1
of 1
the 1
glaciers 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
from 1
pursuit 1
among 1
the 1
ridges 1
of 1
inaccessible 1
precipices 1
was 1
a 1
being 1
possessing 1
faculties 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
vain 1
to 1
cope 1
with 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
pause 1
of 1
reflection 1
i 1
concluded 1
that 1
the 1
justice 1
due 1
both 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
demanded 1
of 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
request 1
turning 1
to 1
him 1
therefore 1
i 1
said 1
i 1
consent 1
to 1
your 1
demand 1
on 1
your 1
solemn 1
oath 1
to 1
quit 1
europe 1
forever 1
and 1
every 1
other 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
i 1
shall 1
deliver 1
into 1
your 1
hands 1
a 1
female 1
who 1
will 1
accompany 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
exile 1
i 1
swear 1
he 1
cried 1
by 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
blue 1
sky 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
of 1
love 1
that 1
burns 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
grant 1
my 1
prayer 1
while 1
they 1
exist 1
you 1
shall 1
never 1
behold 1
me 1
again 1
depart 1
to 1
your 1
home 1
and 1
commence 1
your 1
labours 1
i 1
shall 1
watch 1
their 1
progress 1
with 1
unutterable 1
anxiety 1
and 1
fear 1
not 1
but 1
that 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
ready 1
i 1
shall 1
appear 1
saying 1
this 1
he 1
suddenly 1
quitted 1
me 1
fearful 1
perhaps 1
of 1
any 1
change 1
in 1
my 1
sentiments 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
descend 1
the 1
mountain 1
with 1
greater 1
speed 1
than 1
the 1
flight 1
of 1
an 1
eagle 1
and 1
quickly 1
lost 1
among 1
the 1
undulations 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
his 1
tale 1
had 1
occupied 1
the 1
whole 1
day 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
the 1
horizon 1
when 1
he 1
departed 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
hasten 1
my 1
descent 1
towards 1
the 1
valley 1
as 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
be 1
encompassed 1
in 1
darkness 1
but 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
heavy 1
and 1
my 1
steps 1
slow 1
the 1
labour 1
of 1
winding 1
among 1
the 1
little 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
fixing 1
my 1
feet 1
firmly 1
as 1
i 1
advanced 1
perplexed 1
me 1
occupied 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
by 1
the 1
emotions 1
which 1
the 1
occurrences 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
had 1
produced 1
night 1
was 1
far 1
advanced 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
halfway 1
resting 1
place 1
and 1
seated 1
myself 1
beside 1
the 1
fountain 1
the 1
stars 1
shone 1
at 1
intervals 1
as 1
the 1
clouds 1
passed 1
from 1
over 1
them 1
the 1
dark 1
pines 1
rose 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
every 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
a 1
broken 1
tree 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
scene 1
of 1
wonderful 1
solemnity 1
and 1
stirred 1
strange 1
thoughts 1
within 1
me 1
i 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
and 1
clasping 1
my 1
hands 1
in 1
agony 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
oh 1
stars 1
and 1
clouds 1
and 1
winds 1
ye 1
are 1
all 1
about 1
to 1
mock 1
me 1
if 1
ye 1
really 1
pity 1
me 1
crush 1
sensation 1
and 1
memory 1
let 1
me 1
become 1
as 1
nought 1
but 1
if 1
not 1
depart 1
depart 1
and 1
leave 1
me 1
in 1
darkness 1
these 1
were 1
wild 1
and 1
miserable 1
thoughts 1
but 1
i 1
cannot 1
describe 1
to 1
you 1
how 1
the 1
eternal 1
twinkling 1
of 1
the 1
stars 1
weighed 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
how 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
every 1
blast 1
of 1
wind 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
dull 1
ugly 1
siroc 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
to 1
consume 1
me 1
morning 1
dawned 1
before 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
chamounix 1
i 1
took 1
no 1
rest 1
but 1
returned 1
immediately 1
to 1
geneva 1
even 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
i 1
could 1
give 1
no 1
expression 1
to 1
my 1
sensations 1
they 1
weighed 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
mountain 1
s 1
weight 1
and 1
their 1
excess 1
destroyed 1
my 1
agony 1
beneath 1
them 1
thus 1
i 1
returned 1
home 1
and 1
entering 1
the 1
house 1
presented 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
family 1
my 1
haggard 1
and 1
wild 1
appearance 1
awoke 1
intense 1
alarm 1
but 1
i 1
answered 1
no 1
question 1
scarcely 1
did 1
i 1
speak 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
placed 1
under 1
a 1
ban 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
claim 1
their 1
sympathies 1
as 1
if 1
never 1
more 1
might 1
i 1
enjoy 1
companionship 1
with 1
them 1
yet 1
even 1
thus 1
i 1
loved 1
them 1
to 1
adoration 1
and 1
to 1
save 1
them 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
dedicate 1
myself 1
to 1
my 1
most 1
abhorred 1
task 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
such 1
an 1
occupation 1
made 1
every 1
other 1
circumstance 1
of 1
existence 1
pass 1
before 1
me 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
that 1
thought 1
only 1
had 1
to 1
me 1

reality 1
of 1
life 1

after 1
day 1
week 1
after 1
week 1
passed 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
to 1
geneva 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
collect 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
recommence 1
my 1
work 1
i 1
feared 1
the 1
vengeance 1
of 1
the 1
disappointed 1
fiend 1
yet 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
overcome 1
my 1
repugnance 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
which 1
was 1
enjoined 1
me 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
compose 1
a 1
female 1
without 1
again 1
devoting 1
several 1
months 1
to 1
profound 1
study 1
and 1
laborious 1
disquisition 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
some 1
discoveries 1
having 1
been 1
made 1
by 1
an 1
english 1
philosopher 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
material 1
to 1
my 1
success 1
and 1
i 1
sometimes 1
thought 1
of 1
obtaining 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
consent 1
to 1
visit 1
england 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
but 1
i 1
clung 1
to 1
every 1
pretence 1
of 1
delay 1
and 1
shrank 1
from 1
taking 1
the 1
first 1
step 1
in 1
an 1
undertaking 1
whose 1
immediate 1
necessity 1
began 1
to 1
appear 1
less 1
absolute 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
change 1
indeed 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
me 1
my 1
health 1
which 1
had 1
hitherto 1
declined 1
was 1
now 1
much 1
restored 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
when 1
unchecked 1
by 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
my 1
unhappy 1
promise 1
rose 1
proportionably 1
my 1
father 1
saw 1
this 1
change 1
with 1
pleasure 1
and 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
thoughts 1
towards 1
the 1
best 1
method 1
of 1
eradicating 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
melancholy 1
which 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
would 1
return 1
by 1
fits 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
devouring 1
blackness 1
overcast 1
the 1
approaching 1
sunshine 1
at 1
these 1
moments 1
i 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
perfect 1
solitude 1
i 1
passed 1
whole 1
days 1
on 1
the 1
lake 1
alone 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
boat 1
watching 1
the 1
clouds 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
rippling 1
of 1
the 1
waves 1
silent 1
and 1
listless 1
but 1
the 1
fresh 1
air 1
and 1
bright 1
sun 1
seldom 1
failed 1
to 1
restore 1
me 1
to 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
composure 1
and 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
i 1
met 1
the 1
salutations 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
with 1
a 1
readier 1
smile 1
and 1
a 1
more 1
cheerful 1
heart 1
it 1
was 1
after 1
my 1
return 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
rambles 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
calling 1
me 1
aside 1
thus 1
addressed 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
happy 1
to 1
remark 1
my 1
dear 1
son 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
resumed 1
your 1
former 1
pleasures 1
and 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
returning 1
to 1
yourself 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
are 1
still 1
unhappy 1
and 1
still 1
avoid 1
our 1
society 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
i 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
conjecture 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
this 1
but 1
yesterday 1
an 1
idea 1
struck 1
me 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
founded 1
i 1
conjure 1
you 1
to 1
avow 1
it 1
reserve 1
on 1
such 1
a 1
point 1
would 1
be 1
not 1
only 1
useless 1
but 1
draw 1
down 1
treble 1
misery 1
on 1
us 1
all 1
i 1
trembled 1
violently 1
at 1
his 1
exordium 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
continued 1
i 1
confess 1
my 1
son 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
your 1
marriage 1
with 1
our 1
dear 1
elizabeth 1
as 1
the 1
tie 1
of 1
our 1
domestic 1
comfort 1
and 1
the 1
stay 1
of 1
my 1
declining 1
years 1
you 1
were 1
attached 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
from 1
your 1
earliest 1
infancy 1
you 1
studied 1
together 1
and 1
appeared 1
in 1
dispositions 1
and 1
tastes 1
entirely 1
suited 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
but 1
so 1
blind 1
is 1
the 1
experience 1
of 1
man 1
that 1
what 1
i 1
conceived 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
best 1
assistants 1
to 1
my 1
plan 1
may 1
have 1
entirely 1
destroyed 1
it 1
you 1
perhaps 1
regard 1
her 1
as 1
your 1
sister 1
without 1
any 1
wish 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
become 1
your 1
wife 1
nay 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
met 1
with 1
another 1
whom 1
you 1
may 1
love 1
and 1
considering 1
yourself 1
as 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
elizabeth 1
this 1
struggle 1
may 1
occasion 1
the 1
poignant 1
misery 1
which 1
you 1
appear 1
to 1
feel 1
my 1
dear 1
father 1
reassure 1
yourself 1
i 1
love 1
my 1
cousin 1
tenderly 1
and 1
sincerely 1
i 1
never 1
saw 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
excited 1
as 1
elizabeth 1
does 1
my 1
warmest 1
admiration 1
and 1
affection 1
my 1
future 1
hopes 1
and 1
prospects 1
are 1
entirely 1
bound 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
expectation 1
of 1
our 1
union 1
the 1
expression 1
of 1
your 1
sentiments 1
of 1
this 1
subject 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
gives 1
me 1
more 1
pleasure 1
than 1
i 1
have 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
experienced 1
if 1
you 1
feel 1
thus 1
we 1
shall 1
assuredly 1
be 1
happy 1
however 1
present 1
events 1
may 1
cast 1
a 1
gloom 1
over 1
us 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
this 1
gloom 1
which 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
so 1
strong 1
a 1
hold 1
of 1
your 1
mind 1
that 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
dissipate 1
tell 1
me 1
therefore 1
whether 1
you 1
object 1
to 1
an 1
immediate 1
solemnization 1
of 1
the 1
marriage 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
recent 1
events 1
have 1
drawn 1
us 1
from 1
that 1
everyday 1
tranquillity 1
befitting 1
my 1
years 1
and 1
infirmities 1
you 1
are 1
younger 1
yet 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
suppose 1
possessed 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
of 1
a 1
competent 1
fortune 1
that 1
an 1
early 1
marriage 1
would 1
at 1
all 1
interfere 1
with 1
any 1
future 1
plans 1
of 1
honour 1
and 1
utility 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
formed 1
do 1
not 1
suppose 1
however 1
that 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
dictate 1
happiness 1
to 1
you 1
or 1
that 1
a 1
delay 1
on 1
your 1
part 1
would 1
cause 1
me 1
any 1
serious 1
uneasiness 1
interpret 1
my 1
words 1
with 1
candour 1
and 1
answer 1
me 1
i 1
conjure 1
you 1
with 1
confidence 1
and 1
sincerity 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
in 1
silence 1
and 1
remained 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
incapable 1
of 1
offering 1
any 1
reply 1
i 1
revolved 1
rapidly 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
thoughts 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
some 1
conclusion 1
alas 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
an 1
immediate 1
union 1
with 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
dismay 1
i 1
was 1
bound 1
by 1
a 1
solemn 1
promise 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
fulfilled 1
and 1
dared 1
not 1
break 1
or 1
if 1
i 1
did 1
what 1
manifold 1
miseries 1
might 1
not 1
impend 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
devoted 1
family 1
could 1
i 1
enter 1
into 1
a 1
festival 1
with 1
this 1
deadly 1
weight 1
yet 1
hanging 1
round 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
bowing 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
i 1
must 1
perform 1
my 1
engagement 1
and 1
let 1
the 1
monster 1
depart 1
with 1
his 1
mate 1
before 1
i 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
delight 1
of 1
a 1
union 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
expected 1
peace 1
i 1
remembered 1
also 1
the 1
necessity 1
imposed 1
upon 1
me 1
of 1
either 1
journeying 1
to 1
england 1
or 1
entering 1
into 1
a 1
long 1
correspondence 1
with 1
those 1
philosophers 1
of 1
that 1
country 1
whose 1
knowledge 1
and 1
discoveries 1
were 1
of 1
indispensable 1
use 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
present 1
undertaking 1
the 1
latter 1
method 1
of 1
obtaining 1
the 1
desired 1
intelligence 1
was 1
dilatory 1
and 1
unsatisfactory 1
besides 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
insurmountable 1
aversion 1
to 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
engaging 1
myself 1
in 1
my 1
loathsome 1
task 1
in 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
while 1
in 1
habits 1
of 1
familiar 1
intercourse 1
with 1
those 1
i 1
loved 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
a 1
thousand 1
fearful 1
accidents 1
might 1
occur 1
the 1
slightest 1
of 1
which 1
would 1
disclose 1
a 1
tale 1
to 1
thrill 1
all 1
connected 1
with 1
me 1
with 1
horror 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
also 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
often 1
lose 1
all 1
self 1
command 1
all 1
capacity 1
of 1
hiding 1
the 1
harrowing 1
sensations 1
that 1
would 1
possess 1
me 1
during 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
my 1
unearthly 1
occupation 1
i 1
must 1
absent 1
myself 1
from 1
all 1
i 1
loved 1
while 1
thus 1
employed 1
once 1
commenced 1
it 1
would 1
quickly 1
be 1
achieved 1
and 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
restored 1
to 1
my 1
family 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
happiness 1
my 1
promise 1
fulfilled 1
the 1
monster 1
would 1
depart 1
forever 1
or 1
so 1
my 1
fond 1
fancy 1
imaged 1
some 1
accident 1
might 1
meanwhile 1
occur 1
to 1
destroy 1
him 1
and 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
my 1
slavery 1
forever 1
these 1
feelings 1
dictated 1
my 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
expressed 1
a 1
wish 1
to 1
visit 1
england 1
but 1
concealing 1
the 1
true 1
reasons 1
of 1
this 1
request 1
i 1
clothed 1
my 1
desires 1
under 1
a 1
guise 1
which 1
excited 1
no 1
suspicion 1
while 1
i 1
urged 1
my 1
desire 1
with 1
an 1
earnestness 1
that 1
easily 1
induced 1
my 1
father 1
to 1
comply 1
after 1
so 1
long 1
a 1
period 1
of 1
an 1
absorbing 1
melancholy 1
that 1
resembled 1
madness 1
in 1
its 1
intensity 1
and 1
effects 1
he 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
taking 1
pleasure 1
in 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
journey 1
and 1
he 1
hoped 1
that 1
change 1
of 1
scene 1
and 1
varied 1
amusement 1
would 1
before 1
my 1
return 1
have 1
restored 1
me 1
entirely 1
to 1
myself 1
the 1
duration 1
of 1
my 1
absence 1
was 1
left 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
choice 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
or 1
at 1
most 1
a 1
year 1
was 1
the 1
period 1
contemplated 1
one 1
paternal 1
kind 1
precaution 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
to 1
ensure 1
my 1
having 1
a 1
companion 1
without 1
previously 1
communicating 1
with 1
me 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
concert 1
with 1
elizabeth 1
arranged 1
that 1
clerval 1
should 1
join 1
me 1
at 1
strasbourg 1
this 1
interfered 1
with 1
the 1
solitude 1
i 1
coveted 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
of 1
my 1
task 1
yet 1
at 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
could 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
be 1
an 1
impediment 1
and 1
truly 1
i 1
rejoiced 1
that 1
thus 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
saved 1
many 1
hours 1
of 1
lonely 1
maddening 1
reflection 1
nay 1
henry 1
might 1
stand 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
intrusion 1
of 1
my 1
foe 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
alone 1
would 1
he 1
not 1
at 1
times 1
force 1
his 1
abhorred 1
presence 1
on 1
me 1
to 1
remind 1
me 1
of 1
my 1
task 1
or 1
to 1
contemplate 1
its 1
progress 1
to 1
england 1
therefore 1
i 1
was 1
bound 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
understood 1
that 1
my 1
union 1
with 1
elizabeth 1
should 1
take 1
place 1
immediately 1
on 1
my 1
return 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
age 1
rendered 1
him 1
extremely 1
averse 1
to 1
delay 1
for 1
myself 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
reward 1
i 1
promised 1
myself 1
from 1
my 1
detested 1
toils 1
one 1
consolation 1
for 1
my 1
unparalleled 1
sufferings 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
that 1
day 1
when 1
enfranchised 1
from 1
my 1
miserable 1
slavery 1
i 1
might 1
claim 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
forget 1
the 1
past 1
in 1
my 1
union 1
with 1
her 1
i 1
now 1
made 1
arrangements 1
for 1
my 1
journey 1
but 1
one 1
feeling 1
haunted 1
me 1
which 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
agitation 1
during 1
my 1
absence 1
i 1
should 1
leave 1
my 1
friends 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
their 1
enemy 1
and 1
unprotected 1
from 1
his 1
attacks 1
exasperated 1
as 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
by 1
my 1
departure 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
follow 1
me 1
wherever 1
i 1
might 1
go 1
and 1
would 1
he 1
not 1
accompany 1
me 1
to 1
england 1
this 1
imagination 1
was 1
dreadful 1
in 1
itself 1
but 1
soothing 1
inasmuch 1
as 1
it 1
supposed 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
my 1
friends 1
i 1
was 1
agonized 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
possibility 1
that 1
the 1
reverse 1
of 1
this 1
might 1
happen 1
but 1
through 1
the 1
whole 1
period 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
my 1
creature 1
i 1
allowed 1
myself 1
to 1
be 1
governed 1
by 1
the 1
impulses 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
and 1
my 1
present 1
sensations 1
strongly 1
intimated 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
would 1
follow 1
me 1
and 1
exempt 1
my 1
family 1
from 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
his 1
machinations 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
end 1
of 1
september 1
that 1
i 1
again 1
quitted 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
my 1
journey 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
own 1
suggestion 1
and 1
elizabeth 1
therefore 1
acquiesced 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
disquiet 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
my 1
suffering 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
the 1
inroads 1
of 1
misery 1
and 1
grief 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
her 1
care 1
which 1
provided 1
me 1
a 1
companion 1
in 1
clerval 1
and 1
yet 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
blind 1
to 1
a 1
thousand 1
minute 1
circumstances 1
which 1
call 1
forth 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
sedulous 1
attention 1
she 1
longed 1
to 1
bid 1
me 1
hasten 1
my 1
return 1
a 1
thousand 1
conflicting 1
emotions 1
rendered 1
her 1
mute 1
as 1
she 1
bade 1
me 1
a 1
tearful 1
silent 1
farewell 1
i 1
threw 1
myself 1
into 1
the 1
carriage 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
convey 1
me 1
away 1
hardly 1
knowing 1
whither 1
i 1
was 1
going 1
and 1
careless 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
passing 1
around 1
i 1
remembered 1
only 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
bitter 1
anguish 1
that 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
it 1
to 1
order 1
that 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
should 1
be 1
packed 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
me 1
filled 1
with 1
dreary 1
imaginations 1
i 1
passed 1
through 1
many 1
beautiful 1
and 1
majestic 1
scenes 1
but 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
fixed 1
and 1
unobserving 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
bourne 1
of 1
my 1
travels 1
and 1
the 1
work 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
occupy 1
me 1
whilst 1
they 1
endured 1
after 1
some 1
days 1
spent 1
in 1
listless 1
indolence 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
traversed 1
many 1
leagues 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
strasbourg 1
where 1
i 1
waited 1
two 1
days 1
for 1
clerval 1
he 1
came 1
alas 1
how 1
great 1
was 1
the 1
contrast 1
between 1
us 1
he 1
was 1
alive 1
to 1
every 1
new 1
scene 1
joyful 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
and 1
more 1
happy 1
when 1
he 1
beheld 1
it 1
rise 1
and 1
recommence 1
a 1
new 1
day 1
he 1
pointed 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
shifting 1
colours 1
of 1
the 1
landscape 1
and 1
the 1
appearances 1
of 1
the 1
sky 1
this 1
is 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
live 1
he 1
cried 1
how 1
i 1
enjoy 1
existence 1
but 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
frankenstein 1
wherefore 1
are 1
you 1
desponding 1
and 1
sorrowful 1
in 1
truth 1
i 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
gloomy 1
thoughts 1
and 1
neither 1
saw 1
the 1
descent 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
star 1
nor 1
the 1
golden 1
sunrise 1
reflected 1
in 1
the 1
rhine 1
and 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
would 1
be 1
far 1
more 1
amused 1
with 1
the 1
journal 1
of 1
clerval 1
who 1
observed 1
the 1
scenery 1
with 1
an 1
eye 1
of 1
feeling 1
and 1
delight 1
than 1
in 1
listening 1
to 1
my 1
reflections 1
i 1
a 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
haunted 1
by 1
a 1
curse 1
that 1
shut 1
up 1
every 1
avenue 1
to 1
enjoyment 1
we 1
had 1
agreed 1
to 1
descend 1
the 1
rhine 1
in 1
a 1
boat 1
from 1
strasbourg 1
to 1
rotterdam 1
whence 1
we 1
might 1
take 1
shipping 1
for 1
london 1
during 1
this 1
voyage 1
we 1
passed 1
many 1
willowy 1
islands 1
and 1
saw 1
several 1
beautiful 1
towns 1
we 1
stayed 1
a 1
day 1
at 1
mannheim 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
fifth 1
from 1
our 1
departure 1
from 1
strasbourg 1
arrived 1
at 1
mainz 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
rhine 1
below 1
mainz 1
becomes 1
much 1
more 1
picturesque 1
the 1
river 1
descends 1
rapidly 1
and 1
winds 1
between 1
hills 1
not 1
high 1
but 1
steep 1
and 1
of 1
beautiful 1
forms 1
we 1
saw 1
many 1
ruined 1
castles 1
standing 1
on 1
the 1
edges 1
of 1
precipices 1
surrounded 1
by 1
black 1
woods 1
high 1
and 1
inaccessible 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
rhine 1
indeed 1
presents 1
a 1
singularly 1
variegated 1
landscape 1
in 1
one 1
spot 1
you 1
view 1
rugged 1
hills 1
ruined 1
castles 1
overlooking 1
tremendous 1
precipices 1
with 1
the 1
dark 1
rhine 1
rushing 1
beneath 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
sudden 1
turn 1
of 1
a 1
promontory 1
flourishing 1
vineyards 1
with 1
green 1
sloping 1
banks 1
and 1
a 1
meandering 1
river 1
and 1
populous 1
towns 1
occupy 1
the 1
scene 1
we 1
travelled 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
vintage 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
song 1
of 1
the 1
labourers 1
as 1
we 1
glided 1
down 1
the 1
stream 1
even 1
i 1
depressed 1
in 1
mind 1
and 1
my 1
spirits 1
continually 1
agitated 1
by 1
gloomy 1
feelings 1
even 1
i 1
was 1
pleased 1
i 1
lay 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
gazed 1
on 1
the 1
cloudless 1
blue 1
sky 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
drink 1
in 1
a 1
tranquillity 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
if 1
these 1
were 1
my 1
sensations 1
who 1
can 1
describe 1
those 1
of 1
henry 1
he 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
transported 1
to 1
fairy 1
land 1
and 1
enjoyed 1
a 1
happiness 1
seldom 1
tasted 1
by 1
man 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
he 1
said 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
scenes 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
country 1
i 1
have 1
visited 1
the 1
lakes 1
of 1
lucerne 1
and 1
uri 1
where 1
the 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
descend 1
almost 1
perpendicularly 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
casting 1
black 1
and 1
impenetrable 1
shades 1
which 1
would 1
cause 1
a 1
gloomy 1
and 1
mournful 1
appearance 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
verdant 1
islands 1
that 1
believe 1
the 1
eye 1
by 1
their 1
gay 1
appearance 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
this 1
lake 1
agitated 1
by 1
a 1
tempest 1
when 1
the 1
wind 1
tore 1
up 1
whirlwinds 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
gave 1
you 1
an 1
idea 1
of 1
what 1
the 1
water 1
spout 1
must 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
great 1
ocean 1
and 1
the 1
waves 1
dash 1
with 1
fury 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
where 1
the 1
priest 1
and 1
his 1
mistress 1
were 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
an 1
avalanche 1
and 1
where 1
their 1
dying 1
voices 1
are 1
still 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
amid 1
the 1
pauses 1
of 1
the 1
nightly 1
wind 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
la 1
valais 1
and 1
the 1
pays 1
de 1
vaud 1
but 1
this 1
country 1
victor 1
pleases 1
me 1
more 1
than 1
all 1
those 1
wonders 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
switzerland 1
are 1
more 1
majestic 1
and 1
strange 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
charm 1
in 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
this 1
divine 1
river 1
that 1
i 1
never 1
before 1
saw 1
equalled 1
look 1
at 1
that 1
castle 1
which 1
overhangs 1
yon 1
precipice 1
and 1
that 1
also 1
on 1
the 1
island 1
almost 1
concealed 1
amongst 1
the 1
foliage 1
of 1
those 1
lovely 1
trees 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
group 1
of 1
labourers 1
coming 1
from 1
among 1
their 1
vines 1
and 1
that 1
village 1
half 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
recess 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
oh 1
surely 1
the 1
spirit 1
that 1
inhabits 1
and 1
guards 1
this 1
place 1
has 1
a 1
soul 1
more 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
man 1
than 1
those 1
who 1
pile 1
the 1
glacier 1
or 1
retire 1
to 1
the 1
inaccessible 1
peaks 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
country 1
clerval 1
beloved 1
friend 1
even 1
now 1
it 1
delights 1
me 1
to 1
record 1
your 1
words 1
and 1
to 1
dwell 1
on 1
the 1
praise 1
of 1
which 1
you 1
are 1
so 1
eminently 1
deserving 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
being 1
formed 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
poetry 1
of 1
nature 1
his 1
wild 1
and 1
enthusiastic 1
imagination 1
was 1
chastened 1
by 1
the 1
sensibility 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
his 1
soul 1
overflowed 1
with 1
ardent 1
affections 1
and 1
his 1
friendship 1
was 1
of 1
that 1
devoted 1
and 1
wondrous 1
nature 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
minded 1
teach 1
us 1
to 1
look 1
for 1
only 1
in 1
the 1
imagination 1
but 1
even 1
human 1
sympathies 1
were 1
not 1
sufficient 1
to 1
satisfy 1
his 1
eager 1
mind 1
the 1
scenery 1
of 1
external 1
nature 1
which 1
others 1
regard 1
only 1
with 1
admiration 1
he 1
loved 1
with 1
ardour 1
the 1
sounding 1
cataract 1
haunted 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
passion 1
the 1
tall 1
rock 1
the 1
mountain 1
and 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
gloomy 1
wood 1
their 1
colours 1
and 1
their 1
forms 1
were 1
then 1
to 1
him 1
an 1
appetite 1
a 1
feeling 1
and 1
a 1
love 1
that 1
had 1
no 1
need 1
of 1
a 1
remoter 1
charm 1
by 1
thought 1
supplied 1
or 1
any 1
interest 1
unborrow 1
d 1
from 1
the 1
eye 1
wordsworth 1
s 1
tintern 1
abbey 1
and 1
where 1
does 1
he 1
now 1
exist 1
is 1
this 1
gentle 1
and 1
lovely 1
being 1
lost 1
forever 1
has 1
this 1
mind 1
so 1
replete 1
with 1
ideas 1
imaginations 1
fanciful 1
and 1
magnificent 1
which 1
formed 1
a 1
world 1
whose 1
existence 1
depended 1
on 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
its 1
creator 1
has 1
this 1
mind 1
perished 1
does 1
it 1
now 1
only 1
exist 1
in 1
my 1
memory 1
no 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
thus 1
your 1
form 1
so 1
divinely 1
wrought 1
and 1
beaming 1
with 1
beauty 1
has 1
decayed 1
but 1
your 1
spirit 1
still 1
visits 1
and 1
consoles 1
your 1
unhappy 1
friend 1
pardon 1
this 1
gush 1
of 1
sorrow 1
these 1
ineffectual 1
words 1
are 1
but 1
a 1
slight 1
tribute 1
to 1
the 1
unexampled 1
worth 1
of 1
henry 1
but 1
they 1
soothe 1
my 1
heart 1
overflowing 1
with 1
the 1
anguish 1
which 1
his 1
remembrance 1
creates 1
i 1
will 1
proceed 1
with 1
my 1
tale 1
beyond 1
cologne 1
we 1
descended 1
to 1
the 1
plains 1
of 1
holland 1
and 1
we 1
resolved 1
to 1
post 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
our 1
way 1
for 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
contrary 1
and 1
the 1
stream 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
was 1
too 1
gentle 1
to 1
aid 1
us 1
our 1
journey 1
here 1
lost 1
the 1
interest 1
arising 1
from 1
beautiful 1
scenery 1
but 1
we 1
arrived 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
at 1
rotterdam 1
whence 1
we 1
proceeded 1
by 1
sea 1
to 1
england 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
clear 1
morning 1
in 1
the 1
latter 1
days 1
of 1
december 1
that 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
the 1
white 1
cliffs 1
of 1
britain 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
thames 1
presented 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
they 1
were 1
flat 1
but 1
fertile 1
and 1
almost 1
every 1
town 1
was 1
marked 1
by 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
some 1
story 1
we 1
saw 1
tilbury 1
fort 1
and 1
remembered 1
the 1
spanish 1
armada 1
gravesend 1
woolwich 1
and 1
greenwich 1
places 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
even 1
in 1
my 1
country 1
at 1
length 1
we 1
saw 1
the 1
numerous 1
steeples 1
of 1
london 1
st 1
paul 1
s 1
towering 1
above 1
all 1
and 1
the 1
tower 1
famed 1
in 1
english 1
history 1
chapter 1
19 1
london 1
was 1
our 1
present 1
point 1
of 1
rest 1
we 1
determined 1
to 1
remain 1
several 1
months 1
in 1
this 1
wonderful 1
and 1
celebrated 1
city 1
clerval 1
desired 1
the 1
intercourse 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
genius 1
and 1
talent 1
who 1
flourished 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
with 1
me 1
a 1
secondary 1
object 1
i 1
was 1
principally 1
occupied 1
with 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
obtaining 1
the 1
information 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
and 1
quickly 1
availed 1
myself 1
of 1
the 1
letters 1
of 1
introduction 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
me 1
addressed 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
distinguished 1
natural 1
philosophers 1
if 1
this 1
journey 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
during 1
my 1
days 1
of 1
study 1
and 1
happiness 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
afforded 1
me 1
inexpressible 1
pleasure 1
but 1
a 1
blight 1
had 1
come 1
over 1
my 1
existence 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
visited 1
these 1
people 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
the 1
information 1
they 1
might 1
give 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
in 1
which 1
my 1
interest 1
was 1
so 1
terribly 1
profound 1
company 1
was 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
alone 1
i 1
could 1
fill 1
my 1
mind 1
with 1
the 1
sights 1
of 1
heaven 1
and 1
earth 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
henry 1
soothed 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
thus 1
cheat 1
myself 1
into 1
a 1
transitory 1
peace 1
but 1
busy 1
uninteresting 1
joyous 1
faces 1
brought 1
back 1
despair 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
i 1
saw 1
an 1
insurmountable 1
barrier 1
placed 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
men 1
this 1
barrier 1
was 1
sealed 1
with 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
william 1
and 1
justine 1
and 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
the 1
events 1
connected 1
with 1
those 1
names 1
filled 1
my 1
soul 1
with 1
anguish 1
but 1
in 1
clerval 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
my 1
former 1
self 1
he 1
was 1
inquisitive 1
and 1
anxious 1
to 1
gain 1
experience 1
and 1
instruction 1
the 1
difference 1
of 1
manners 1
which 1
he 1
observed 1
was 1
to 1
him 1
an 1
inexhaustible 1
source 1
of 1
instruction 1
and 1
amusement 1
he 1
was 1
also 1
pursuing 1
an 1
object 1
he 1
had 1
long 1
had 1
in 1
view 1
his 1
design 1
was 1
to 1
visit 1
india 1
in 1
the 1
belief 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
his 1
knowledge 1
of 1
its 1
various 1
languages 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
views 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
of 1
its 1
society 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
materially 1
assisting 1
the 1
progress 1
of 1
european 1
colonization 1
and 1
trade 1
in 1
britain 1
only 1
could 1
he 1
further 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
his 1
plan 1
he 1
was 1
forever 1
busy 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
check 1
to 1
his 1
enjoyments 1
was 1
my 1
sorrowful 1
and 1
dejected 1
mind 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
conceal 1
this 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
not 1
debar 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
pleasures 1
natural 1
to 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
entering 1
on 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
of 1
life 1
undisturbed 1
by 1
any 1
care 1
or 1
bitter 1
recollection 1
i 1
often 1
refused 1
to 1
accompany 1
him 1
alleging 1
another 1
engagement 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
remain 1
alone 1
i 1
now 1
also 1
began 1
to 1
collect 1
the 1
materials 1
necessary 1
for 1
my 1
new 1
creation 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
the 1
torture 1
of 1
single 1
drops 1
of 1
water 1
continually 1
falling 1
on 1
the 1
head 1
every 1
thought 1
that 1
was 1
devoted 1
to 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
extreme 1
anguish 1
and 1
every 1
word 1
that 1
i 1
spoke 1
in 1
allusion 1
to 1
it 1
caused 1
my 1
lips 1
to 1
quiver 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
palpitate 1
after 1
passing 1
some 1
months 1
in 1
london 1
we 1
received 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
a 1
person 1
in 1
scotland 1
who 1
had 1
formerly 1
been 1
our 1
visitor 1
at 1
geneva 1
he 1
mentioned 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
his 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
asked 1
us 1
if 1
those 1
were 1
not 1
sufficient 1
allurements 1
to 1
induce 1
us 1
to 1
prolong 1
our 1
journey 1
as 1
far 1
north 1
as 1
perth 1
where 1
he 1
resided 1
clerval 1
eagerly 1
desired 1
to 1
accept 1
this 1
invitation 1
and 1
i 1
although 1
i 1
abhorred 1
society 1
wished 1
to 1
view 1
again 1
mountains 1
and 1
streams 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
wondrous 1
works 1
with 1
which 1
nature 1
adorns 1
her 1
chosen 1
dwelling 1
places 1
we 1
had 1
arrived 1
in 1
england 1
at 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
october 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
february 1
we 1
accordingly 1
determined 1
to 1
commence 1
our 1
journey 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
at 1
the 1
expiration 1
of 1
another 1
month 1
in 1
this 1
expedition 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
great 1
road 1
to 1
edinburgh 1
but 1
to 1
visit 1
windsor 1
oxford 1
matlock 1
and 1
the 1
cumberland 1
lakes 1
resolving 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
this 1
tour 1
about 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
july 1
i 1
packed 1
up 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
and 1
the 1
materials 1
i 1
had 1
collected 1
resolving 1
to 1
finish 1
my 1
labours 1
in 1
some 1
obscure 1
nook 1
in 1
the 1
northern 1
highlands 1
of 1
scotland 1
we 1
quitted 1
london 1
on 1
the 1
27th 1
of 1
march 1
and 1
remained 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
at 1
windsor 1
rambling 1
in 1
its 1
beautiful 1
forest 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
scene 1
to 1
us 1
mountaineers 1
the 1
majestic 1
oaks 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
game 1
and 1
the 1
herds 1
of 1
stately 1
deer 1
were 1
all 1
novelties 1
to 1
us 1
from 1
thence 1
we 1
proceeded 1
to 1
oxford 1
as 1
we 1
entered 1
this 1
city 1
our 1
minds 1
were 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
the 1
events 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
transacted 1
there 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
century 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
that 1
charles 1
i 1
had 1
collected 1
his 1
forces 1
this 1
city 1
had 1
remained 1
faithful 1
to 1
him 1
after 1
the 1
whole 1
nation 1
had 1
forsaken 1
his 1
cause 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
standard 1
of 1
parliament 1
and 1
liberty 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
that 1
unfortunate 1
king 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
the 1
amiable 1
falkland 1
the 1
insolent 1
goring 1
his 1
queen 1
and 1
son 1
gave 1
a 1
peculiar 1
interest 1
to 1
every 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
which 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
inhabited 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
elder 1
days 1
found 1
a 1
dwelling 1
here 1
and 1
we 1
delighted 1
to 1
trace 1
its 1
footsteps 1
if 1
these 1
feelings 1
had 1
not 1
found 1
an 1
imaginary 1
gratification 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
had 1
yet 1
in 1
itself 1
sufficient 1
beauty 1
to 1
obtain 1
our 1
admiration 1
the 1
colleges 1
are 1
ancient 1
and 1
picturesque 1
the 1
streets 1
are 1
almost 1
magnificent 1
and 1
the 1
lovely 1
isis 1
which 1
flows 1
beside 1
it 1
through 1
meadows 1
of 1
exquisite 1
verdure 1
is 1
spread 1
forth 1
into 1
a 1
placid 1
expanse 1
of 1
waters 1
which 1
reflects 1
its 1
majestic 1
assemblage 1
of 1
towers 1
and 1
spires 1
and 1
domes 1
embosomed 1
among 1
aged 1
trees 1
i 1
enjoyed 1
this 1
scene 1
and 1
yet 1
my 1
enjoyment 1
was 1
embittered 1
both 1
by 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
the 1
anticipation 1
of 1
the 1
future 1
i 1
was 1
formed 1
for 1
peaceful 1
happiness 1
during 1
my 1
youthful 1
days 1
discontent 1
never 1
visited 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
ever 1
overcome 1
by 1
ennui 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
beautiful 1
in 1
nature 1
or 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
excellent 1
and 1
sublime 1
in 1
the 1
productions 1
of 1
man 1
could 1
always 1
interest 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
communicate 1
elasticity 1
to 1
my 1
spirits 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
blasted 1
tree 1
the 1
bolt 1
has 1
entered 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
then 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
survive 1
to 1
exhibit 1
what 1
i 1
shall 1
soon 1
cease 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
miserable 1
spectacle 1
of 1
wrecked 1
humanity 1
pitiable 1
to 1
others 1
and 1
intolerable 1
to 1
myself 1
we 1
passed 1
a 1
considerable 1
period 1
at 1
oxford 1
rambling 1
among 1
its 1
environs 1
and 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
identify 1
every 1
spot 1
which 1
might 1
relate 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
animating 1
epoch 1
of 1
english 1
history 1
our 1
little 1
voyages 1
of 1
discovery 1
were 1
often 1
prolonged 1
by 1
the 1
successive 1
objects 1
that 1
presented 1
themselves 1
we 1
visited 1
the 1
tomb 1
of 1
the 1
illustrious 1
hampden 1
and 1
the 1
field 1
on 1
which 1
that 1
patriot 1
fell 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
my 1
soul 1
was 1
elevated 1
from 1
its 1
debasing 1
and 1
miserable 1
fears 1
to 1
contemplate 1
the 1
divine 1
ideas 1
of 1
liberty 1
and 1
self 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
which 1
these 1
sights 1
were 1
the 1
monuments 1
and 1
the 1
remembrancers 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
i 1
dared 1
to 1
shake 1
off 1
my 1
chains 1
and 1
look 1
around 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
free 1
and 1
lofty 1
spirit 1
but 1
the 1
iron 1
had 1
eaten 1
into 1
my 1
flesh 1
and 1
i 1
sank 1
again 1
trembling 1
and 1
hopeless 1
into 1
my 1
miserable 1
self 1
we 1
left 1
oxford 1
with 1
regret 1
and 1
proceeded 1
to 1
matlock 1
which 1
was 1
our 1
next 1
place 1
of 1
rest 1
the 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
this 1
village 1
resembled 1
to 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
the 1
scenery 1
of 1
switzerland 1
but 1
everything 1
is 1
on 1
a 1
lower 1
scale 1
and 1
the 1
green 1
hills 1
want 1
the 1
crown 1
of 1
distant 1
white 1
alps 1
which 1
always 1
attend 1
on 1
the 1
piny 1
mountains 1
of 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
we 1
visited 1
the 1
wondrous 1
cave 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
cabinets 1
of 1
natural 1
history 1
where 1
the 1
curiosities 1
are 1
disposed 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
collections 1
at 1
servox 1
and 1
chamounix 1
the 1
latter 1
name 1
made 1
me 1
tremble 1
when 1
pronounced 1
by 1
henry 1
and 1
i 1
hastened 1
to 1
quit 1
matlock 1
with 1
which 1
that 1
terrible 1
scene 1
was 1
thus 1
associated 1
from 1
derby 1
still 1
journeying 1
northwards 1
we 1
passed 1
two 1
months 1
in 1
cumberland 1
and 1
westmorland 1
i 1
could 1
now 1
almost 1
fancy 1
myself 1
among 1
the 1
swiss 1
mountains 1
the 1
little 1
patches 1
of 1
snow 1
which 1
yet 1
lingered 1
on 1
the 1
northern 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
mountains 1
the 1
lakes 1
and 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
rocky 1
streams 1
were 1
all 1
familiar 1
and 1
dear 1
sights 1
to 1
me 1
here 1
also 1
we 1
made 1
some 1
acquaintances 1
who 1
almost 1
contrived 1
to 1
cheat 1
me 1
into 1
happiness 1
the 1
delight 1
of 1
clerval 1
was 1
proportionably 1
greater 1
than 1
mine 1
his 1
mind 1
expanded 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
men 1
of 1
talent 1
and 1
he 1
found 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
nature 1
greater 1
capacities 1
and 1
resources 1
than 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
imagined 1
himself 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
while 1
he 1
associated 1
with 1
his 1
inferiors 1
i 1
could 1
pass 1
my 1
life 1
here 1
said 1
he 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
among 1
these 1
mountains 1
i 1
should 1
scarcely 1
regret 1
switzerland 1
and 1
the 1
rhine 1
but 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
a 1
traveller 1
s 1
life 1
is 1
one 1
that 1
includes 1
much 1
pain 1
amidst 1
its 1
enjoyments 1
his 1
feelings 1
are 1
forever 1
on 1
the 1
stretch 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
begins 1
to 1
sink 1
into 1
repose 1
he 1
finds 1
himself 1
obliged 1
to 1
quit 1
that 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
rests 1
in 1
pleasure 1
for 1
something 1
new 1
which 1
again 1
engages 1
his 1
attention 1
and 1
which 1
also 1
he 1
forsakes 1
for 1
other 1
novelties 1
we 1
had 1
scarcely 1
visited 1
the 1
various 1
lakes 1
of 1
cumberland 1
and 1
westmorland 1
and 1
conceived 1
an 1
affection 1
for 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
when 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
our 1
appointment 1
with 1
our 1
scotch 1
friend 1
approached 1
and 1
we 1
left 1
them 1
to 1
travel 1
on 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
part 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
sorry 1
i 1
had 1
now 1
neglected 1
my 1
promise 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
i 1
feared 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
s 1
disappointment 1
he 1
might 1
remain 1
in 1
switzerland 1
and 1
wreak 1
his 1
vengeance 1
on 1
my 1
relatives 1
this 1
idea 1
pursued 1
me 1
and 1
tormented 1
me 1
at 1
every 1
moment 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
might 1
otherwise 1
have 1
snatched 1
repose 1
and 1
peace 1
i 1
waited 1
for 1
my 1
letters 1
with 1
feverish 1
impatience 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
delayed 1
i 1
was 1
miserable 1
and 1
overcome 1
by 1
a 1
thousand 1
fears 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
arrived 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
superscription 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
or 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
hardly 1
dared 1
to 1
read 1
and 1
ascertain 1
my 1
fate 1
sometimes 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
followed 1
me 1
and 1
might 1
expedite 1
my 1
remissness 1
by 1
murdering 1
my 1
companion 1
when 1
these 1
thoughts 1
possessed 1
me 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
quit 1
henry 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
followed 1
him 1
as 1
his 1
shadow 1
to 1
protect 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
fancied 1
rage 1
of 1
his 1
destroyer 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
committed 1
some 1
great 1
crime 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
which 1
haunted 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
guiltless 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
indeed 1
drawn 1
down 1
a 1
horrible 1
curse 1
upon 1
my 1
head 1
as 1
mortal 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
crime 1
i 1
visited 1
edinburgh 1
with 1
languid 1
eyes 1
and 1
mind 1
and 1
yet 1
that 1
city 1
might 1
have 1
interested 1
the 1
most 1
unfortunate 1
being 1
clerval 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
it 1
so 1
well 1
as 1
oxford 1
for 1
the 1
antiquity 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
city 1
was 1
more 1
pleasing 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
beauty 1
and 1
regularity 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
town 1
of 1
edinburgh 1
its 1
romantic 1
castle 1
and 1
its 1
environs 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
arthur 1
s 1
seat 1
st 1
bernard 1
s 1
well 1
and 1
the 1
pentland 1
hills 1
compensated 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
change 1
and 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
cheerfulness 1
and 1
admiration 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
impatient 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
the 1
termination 1
of 1
my 1
journey 1
we 1
left 1
edinburgh 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
passing 1
through 1
coupar 1
st 1
andrew 1
s 1
and 1
along 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
the 1
tay 1
to 1
perth 1
where 1
our 1
friend 1
expected 1
us 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
no 1
mood 1
to 1
laugh 1
and 1
talk 1
with 1
strangers 1
or 1
enter 1
into 1
their 1
feelings 1
or 1
plans 1
with 1
the 1
good 1
humour 1
expected 1
from 1
a 1
guest 1
and 1
accordingly 1
i 1
told 1
clerval 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
tour 1
of 1
scotland 1
alone 1
do 1
you 1
said 1
i 1
enjoy 1
yourself 1
and 1
let 1
this 1
be 1
our 1
rendezvous 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
absent 1
a 1
month 1
or 1
two 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
interfere 1
with 1
my 1
motions 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
leave 1
me 1
to 1
peace 1
and 1
solitude 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
return 1
i 1
hope 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
with 1
a 1
lighter 1
heart 1
more 1
congenial 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
temper 1
henry 1
wished 1
to 1
dissuade 1
me 1
but 1
seeing 1
me 1
bent 1
on 1
this 1
plan 1
ceased 1
to 1
remonstrate 1
he 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
write 1
often 1
i 1
had 1
rather 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
your 1
solitary 1
rambles 1
than 1
with 1
these 1
scotch 1
people 1
whom 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
hasten 1
then 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
to 1
return 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
again 1
feel 1
myself 1
somewhat 1
at 1
home 1
which 1
i 1
cannot 1
do 1
in 1
your 1
absence 1
having 1
parted 1
from 1
my 1
friend 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
visit 1
some 1
remote 1
spot 1
of 1
scotland 1
and 1
finish 1
my 1
work 1
in 1
solitude 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
monster 1
followed 1
me 1
and 1
would 1
discover 1
himself 1
to 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
finished 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
receive 1
his 1
companion 1
with 1
this 1
resolution 1
i 1
traversed 1
the 1
northern 1
highlands 1
and 1
fixed 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
remotest 1
of 1
the 1
orkneys 1
as 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
place 1
fitted 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
work 1
being 1
hardly 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
rock 1
whose 1
high 1
sides 1
were 1
continually 1
beaten 1
upon 1
by 1
the 1
waves 1
the 1
soil 1
was 1
barren 1
scarcely 1
affording 1
pasture 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
miserable 1
cows 1
and 1
oatmeal 1
for 1
its 1
inhabitants 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
five 1
persons 1
whose 1
gaunt 1
and 1
scraggy 1
limbs 1
gave 1
tokens 1
of 1
their 1
miserable 1
fare 1
vegetables 1
and 1
bread 1
when 1
they 1
indulged 1
in 1
such 1
luxuries 1
and 1
even 1
fresh 1
water 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
procured 1
from 1
the 1
mainland 1
which 1
was 1
about 1
five 1
miles 1
distant 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
island 1
there 1
were 1
but 1
three 1
miserable 1
huts 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
was 1
vacant 1
when 1
i 1
arrived 1
this 1
i 1
hired 1
it 1
contained 1
but 1
two 1
rooms 1
and 1
these 1
exhibited 1
all 1
the 1
squalidness 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
penury 1
the 1
thatch 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
unplastered 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
off 1
its 1
hinges 1
i 1
ordered 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
repaired 1
bought 1
some 1
furniture 1
and 1
took 1
possession 1
an 1
incident 1
which 1
would 1
doubtless 1
have 1
occasioned 1
some 1
surprise 1
had 1
not 1
all 1
the 1
senses 1
of 1
the 1
cottagers 1
been 1
benumbed 1
by 1
want 1
and 1
squalid 1
poverty 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
lived 1
ungazed 1
at 1
and 1
unmolested 1
hardly 1
thanked 1
for 1
the 1
pittance 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
clothes 1
which 1
i 1
gave 1
so 1
much 1
does 1
suffering 1
blunt 1
even 1
the 1
coarsest 1
sensations 1
of 1
men 1
in 1
this 1
retreat 1
i 1
devoted 1
the 1
morning 1
to 1
labour 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
when 1
the 1
weather 1
permitted 1
i 1
walked 1
on 1
the 1
stony 1
beach 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
the 1
waves 1
as 1
they 1
roared 1
and 1
dashed 1
at 1
my 1
feet 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
monotonous 1
yet 1
ever 1
changing 1
scene 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
switzerland 1
it 1
was 1
far 1
different 1
from 1
this 1
desolate 1
and 1
appalling 1
landscape 1
its 1
hills 1
are 1
covered 1
with 1
vines 1
and 1
its 1
cottages 1
are 1
scattered 1
thickly 1
in 1
the 1
plains 1
its 1
fair 1
lakes 1
reflect 1
a 1
blue 1
and 1
gentle 1
sky 1
and 1
when 1
troubled 1
by 1
the 1
winds 1
their 1
tumult 1
is 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
play 1
of 1
a 1
lively 1
infant 1
when 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
roarings 1
of 1
the 1
giant 1
ocean 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
i 1
distributed 1
my 1
occupations 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
arrived 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
proceeded 1
in 1
my 1
labour 1
it 1
became 1
every 1
day 1
more 1
horrible 1
and 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
sometimes 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
prevail 1
on 1
myself 1
to 1
enter 1
my 1
laboratory 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
and 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
i 1
toiled 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
complete 1
my 1
work 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
filthy 1
process 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
during 1
my 1
first 1
experiment 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
enthusiastic 1
frenzy 1
had 1
blinded 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
employment 1
my 1
mind 1
was 1
intently 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
my 1
labour 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
were 1
shut 1
to 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
my 1
proceedings 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
it 1
in 1
cold 1
blood 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
often 1
sickened 1
at 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
thus 1
situated 1
employed 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
detestable 1
occupation 1
immersed 1
in 1
a 1
solitude 1
where 1
nothing 1
could 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
call 1
my 1
attention 1
from 1
the 1
actual 1
scene 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
my 1
spirits 1
became 1
unequal 1
i 1
grew 1
restless 1
and 1
nervous 1
every 1
moment 1
i 1
feared 1
to 1
meet 1
my 1
persecutor 1
sometimes 1
i 1
sat 1
with 1
my 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
fearing 1
to 1
raise 1
them 1
lest 1
they 1
should 1
encounter 1
the 1
object 1
which 1
i 1
so 1
much 1
dreaded 1
to 1
behold 1
i 1
feared 1
to 1
wander 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
lest 1
when 1
alone 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
claim 1
his 1
companion 1
in 1
the 1
mean 1
time 1
i 1
worked 1
on 1
and 1
my 1
labour 1
was 1
already 1
considerably 1
advanced 1
i 1
looked 1
towards 1
its 1
completion 1
with 1
a 1
tremulous 1
and 1
eager 1
hope 1
which 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
trust 1
myself 1
to 1
question 1
but 1
which 1
was 1
intermixed 1
with 1
obscure 1
forebodings 1
of 1
evil 1
that 1
made 1
my 1
heart 1
sicken 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
chapter 1
20 1
i 1
sat 1
one 1
evening 1
in 1
my 1
laboratory 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
set 1
and 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
just 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
sea 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
sufficient 1
light 1
for 1
my 1
employment 1
and 1
i 1
remained 1
idle 1
in 1
a 1
pause 1
of 1
consideration 1
of 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
leave 1
my 1
labour 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
or 1
hasten 1
its 1
conclusion 1
by 1
an 1
unremitting 1
attention 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
sat 1
a 1
train 1
of 1
reflection 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
which 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
consider 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
doing 1
three 1
years 1
before 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
manner 1
and 1
had 1
created 1
a 1
fiend 1
whose 1
unparalleled 1
barbarity 1
had 1
desolated 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
filled 1
it 1
forever 1
with 1
the 1
bitterest 1
remorse 1
i 1
was 1
now 1
about 1
to 1
form 1
another 1
being 1
of 1
whose 1
dispositions 1
i 1
was 1
alike 1
ignorant 1
she 1
might 1
become 1
ten 1
thousand 1
times 1
more 1
malignant 1
than 1
her 1
mate 1
and 1
delight 1
for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
in 1
murder 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
he 1
had 1
sworn 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
in 1
deserts 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
and 1
she 1
who 1
in 1
all 1
probability 1
was 1
to 1
become 1
a 1
thinking 1
and 1
reasoning 1
animal 1
might 1
refuse 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
a 1
compact 1
made 1
before 1
her 1
creation 1
they 1
might 1
even 1
hate 1
each 1
other 1
the 1
creature 1
who 1
already 1
lived 1
loathed 1
his 1
own 1
deformity 1
and 1
might 1
he 1
not 1
conceive 1
a 1
greater 1
abhorrence 1
for 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
in 1
the 1
female 1
form 1
she 1
also 1
might 1
turn 1
with 1
disgust 1
from 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
superior 1
beauty 1
of 1
man 1
she 1
might 1
quit 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
be 1
again 1
alone 1
exasperated 1
by 1
the 1
fresh 1
provocation 1
of 1
being 1
deserted 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
species 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
leave 1
europe 1
and 1
inhabit 1
the 1
deserts 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
world 1
yet 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
results 1
of 1
those 1
sympathies 1
for 1
which 1
the 1
daemon 1
thirsted 1
would 1
be 1
children 1
and 1
a 1
race 1
of 1
devils 1
would 1
be 1
propagated 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
who 1
might 1
make 1
the 1
very 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
species 1
of 1
man 1
a 1
condition 1
precarious 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
terror 1
had 1
i 1
right 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
benefit 1
to 1
inflict 1
this 1
curse 1
upon 1
everlasting 1
generations 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
moved 1
by 1
the 1
sophisms 1
of 1
the 1
being 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
struck 1
senseless 1
by 1
his 1
fiendish 1
threats 1
but 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
wickedness 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
burst 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
shuddered 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
future 1
ages 1
might 1
curse 1
me 1
as 1
their 1
pest 1
whose 1
selfishness 1
had 1
not 1
hesitated 1
to 1
buy 1
its 1
own 1
peace 1
at 1
the 1
price 1
perhaps 1
of 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
human 1
race 1
i 1
trembled 1
and 1
my 1
heart 1
failed 1
within 1
me 1
when 1
on 1
looking 1
up 1
i 1
saw 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
the 1
daemon 1
at 1
the 1
casement 1
a 1
ghastly 1
grin 1
wrinkled 1
his 1
lips 1
as 1
he 1
gazed 1
on 1
me 1
where 1
i 1
sat 1
fulfilling 1
the 1
task 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
allotted 1
to 1
me 1
yes 1
he 1
had 1
followed 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
travels 1
he 1
had 1
loitered 1
in 1
forests 1
hid 1
himself 1
in 1
caves 1
or 1
taken 1
refuge 1
in 1
wide 1
and 1
desert 1
heaths 1
and 1
he 1
now 1
came 1
to 1
mark 1
my 1
progress 1
and 1
claim 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
my 1
promise 1
as 1
i 1
looked 1
on 1
him 1
his 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
the 1
utmost 1
extent 1
of 1
malice 1
and 1
treachery 1
i 1
thought 1
with 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
madness 1
on 1
my 1
promise 1
of 1
creating 1
another 1
like 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
trembling 1
with 1
passion 1
tore 1
to 1
pieces 1
the 1
thing 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
engaged 1
the 1
wretch 1
saw 1
me 1
destroy 1
the 1
creature 1
on 1
whose 1
future 1
existence 1
he 1
depended 1
for 1
happiness 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
howl 1
of 1
devilish 1
despair 1
and 1
revenge 1
withdrew 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
locking 1
the 1
door 1
made 1
a 1
solemn 1
vow 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
never 1
to 1
resume 1
my 1
labours 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
trembling 1
steps 1
i 1
sought 1
my 1
own 1
apartment 1
i 1
was 1
alone 1
none 1
were 1
near 1
me 1
to 1
dissipate 1
the 1
gloom 1
and 1
relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
sickening 1
oppression 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
terrible 1
reveries 1
several 1
hours 1
passed 1
and 1
i 1
remained 1
near 1
my 1
window 1
gazing 1
on 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
was 1
almost 1
motionless 1
for 1
the 1
winds 1
were 1
hushed 1
and 1
all 1
nature 1
reposed 1
under 1
the 1
eye 1
of 1
the 1
quiet 1
moon 1
a 1
few 1
fishing 1
vessels 1
alone 1
specked 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
wafted 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
as 1
the 1
fishermen 1
called 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
silence 1
although 1
i 1
was 1
hardly 1
conscious 1
of 1
its 1
extreme 1
profundity 1
until 1
my 1
ear 1
was 1
suddenly 1
arrested 1
by 1
the 1
paddling 1
of 1
oars 1
near 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
a 1
person 1
landed 1
close 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
after 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
creaking 1
of 1
my 1
door 1
as 1
if 1
some 1
one 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
softly 1
i 1
trembled 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
presentiment 1
of 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
rouse 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
peasants 1
who 1
dwelt 1
in 1
a 1
cottage 1
not 1
far 1
from 1
mine 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
the 1
sensation 1
of 1
helplessness 1
so 1
often 1
felt 1
in 1
frightful 1
dreams 1
when 1
you 1
in 1
vain 1
endeavour 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
an 1
impending 1
danger 1
and 1
was 1
rooted 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
presently 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
footsteps 1
along 1
the 1
passage 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
the 1
wretch 1
whom 1
i 1
dreaded 1
appeared 1
shutting 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
approached 1
me 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
smothered 1
voice 1
you 1
have 1
destroyed 1
the 1
work 1
which 1
you 1
began 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
intend 1
do 1
you 1
dare 1
to 1
break 1
your 1
promise 1
i 1
have 1
endured 1
toil 1
and 1
misery 1
i 1
left 1
switzerland 1
with 1
you 1
i 1
crept 1
along 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
the 1
rhine 1
among 1
its 1
willow 1
islands 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
summits 1
of 1
its 1
hills 1
i 1
have 1
dwelt 1
many 1
months 1
in 1
the 1
heaths 1
of 1
england 1
and 1
among 1
the 1
deserts 1
of 1
scotland 1
i 1
have 1
endured 1
incalculable 1
fatigue 1
and 1
cold 1
and 1
hunger 1
do 1
you 1
dare 1
destroy 1
my 1
hopes 1
begone 1
i 1
do 1
break 1
my 1
promise 1
never 1
will 1
i 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
yourself 1
equal 1
in 1
deformity 1
and 1
wickedness 1
slave 1
i 1
before 1
reasoned 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
proved 1
yourself 1
unworthy 1
of 1
my 1
condescension 1
remember 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
power 1
you 1
believe 1
yourself 1
miserable 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
make 1
you 1
so 1
wretched 1
that 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
will 1
be 1
hateful 1
to 1
you 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
creator 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
your 1
master 1
obey 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
my 1
irresolution 1
is 1
past 1
and 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
your 1
power 1
is 1
arrived 1
your 1
threats 1
cannot 1
move 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
wickedness 1
but 1
they 1
confirm 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
determination 1
of 1
not 1
creating 1
you 1
a 1
companion 1
in 1
vice 1
shall 1
i 1
in 1
cool 1
blood 1
set 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
earth 1
a 1
daemon 1
whose 1
delight 1
is 1
in 1
death 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
begone 1
i 1
am 1
firm 1
and 1
your 1
words 1
will 1
only 1
exasperate 1
my 1
rage 1
the 1
monster 1
saw 1
my 1
determination 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
gnashed 1
his 1
teeth 1
in 1
the 1
impotence 1
of 1
anger 1
shall 1
each 1
man 1
cried 1
he 1
find 1
a 1
wife 1
for 1
his 1
bosom 1
and 1
each 1
beast 1
have 1
his 1
mate 1
and 1
i 1
be 1
alone 1
i 1
had 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
requited 1
by 1
detestation 1
and 1
scorn 1
man 1
you 1
may 1
hate 1
but 1
beware 1
your 1
hours 1
will 1
pass 1
in 1
dread 1
and 1
misery 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
bolt 1
will 1
fall 1
which 1
must 1
ravish 1
from 1
you 1
your 1
happiness 1
forever 1
are 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
happy 1
while 1
i 1
grovel 1
in 1
the 1
intensity 1
of 1
my 1
wretchedness 1
you 1
can 1
blast 1
my 1
other 1
passions 1
but 1
revenge 1
remains 1
revenge 1
henceforth 1
dearer 1
than 1
light 1
or 1
food 1
i 1
may 1
die 1
but 1
first 1
you 1
my 1
tyrant 1
and 1
tormentor 1
shall 1
curse 1
the 1
sun 1
that 1
gazes 1
on 1
your 1
misery 1
beware 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
fearless 1
and 1
therefore 1
powerful 1
i 1
will 1
watch 1
with 1
the 1
wiliness 1
of 1
a 1
snake 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
sting 1
with 1
its 1
venom 1
man 1
you 1
shall 1
repent 1
of 1
the 1
injuries 1
you 1
inflict 1
devil 1
cease 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
poison 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
these 1
sounds 1
of 1
malice 1
i 1
have 1
declared 1
my 1
resolution 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
coward 1
to 1
bend 1
beneath 1
words 1
leave 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
inexorable 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
i 1
go 1
but 1
remember 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
wedding 1
night 1
i 1
started 1
forward 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
villain 1
before 1
you 1
sign 1
my 1
death 1
warrant 1
be 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
yourself 1
safe 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
seized 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
eluded 1
me 1
and 1
quitted 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
precipitation 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
boat 1
which 1
shot 1
across 1
the 1
waters 1
with 1
an 1
arrowy 1
swiftness 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
lost 1
amidst 1
the 1
waves 1
all 1
was 1
again 1
silent 1
but 1
his 1
words 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
i 1
burned 1
with 1
rage 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
my 1
peace 1
and 1
precipitate 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
i 1
walked 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
my 1
room 1
hastily 1
and 1
perturbed 1
while 1
my 1
imagination 1
conjured 1
up 1
a 1
thousand 1
images 1
to 1
torment 1
and 1
sting 1
me 1
why 1
had 1
i 1
not 1
followed 1
him 1
and 1
closed 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
mortal 1
strife 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
suffered 1
him 1
to 1
depart 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
directed 1
his 1
course 1
towards 1
the 1
mainland 1
i 1
shuddered 1
to 1
think 1
who 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
victim 1
sacrificed 1
to 1
his 1
insatiate 1
revenge 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
again 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
wedding 1
night 1
that 1
then 1
was 1
the 1
period 1
fixed 1
for 1
the 1
fulfilment 1
of 1
my 1
destiny 1
in 1
that 1
hour 1
i 1
should 1
die 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
satisfy 1
and 1
extinguish 1
his 1
malice 1
the 1
prospect 1
did 1
not 1
move 1
me 1
to 1
fear 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
elizabeth 1
of 1
her 1
tears 1
and 1
endless 1
sorrow 1
when 1
she 1
should 1
find 1
her 1
lover 1
so 1
barbarously 1
snatched 1
from 1
her 1
tears 1
the 1
first 1
i 1
had 1
shed 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
streamed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
i 1
resolved 1
not 1
to 1
fall 1
before 1
my 1
enemy 1
without 1
a 1
bitter 1
struggle 1
the 1
night 1
passed 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
ocean 1
my 1
feelings 1
became 1
calmer 1
if 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
called 1
calmness 1
when 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
rage 1
sinks 1
into 1
the 1
depths 1
of 1
despair 1
i 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
the 1
horrid 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
night 1
s 1
contention 1
and 1
walked 1
on 1
the 1
beach 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
which 1
i 1
almost 1
regarded 1
as 1
an 1
insuperable 1
barrier 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
nay 1
a 1
wish 1
that 1
such 1
should 1
prove 1
the 1
fact 1
stole 1
across 1
me 1
i 1
desired 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
pass 1
my 1
life 1
on 1
that 1
barren 1
rock 1
wearily 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
but 1
uninterrupted 1
by 1
any 1
sudden 1
shock 1
of 1
misery 1
if 1
i 1
returned 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
sacrificed 1
or 1
to 1
see 1
those 1
whom 1
i 1
most 1
loved 1
die 1
under 1
the 1
grasp 1
of 1
a 1
daemon 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
myself 1
created 1
i 1
walked 1
about 1
the 1
isle 1
like 1
a 1
restless 1
spectre 1
separated 1
from 1
all 1
it 1
loved 1
and 1
miserable 1
in 1
the 1
separation 1
when 1
it 1
became 1
noon 1
and 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
higher 1
i 1
lay 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
was 1
overpowered 1
by 1
a 1
deep 1
sleep 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
awake 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1
preceding 1
night 1
my 1
nerves 1
were 1
agitated 1
and 1
my 1
eyes 1
inflamed 1
by 1
watching 1
and 1
misery 1
the 1
sleep 1
into 1
which 1
i 1
now 1
sank 1
refreshed 1
me 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
i 1
again 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
belonged 1
to 1
a 1
race 1
of 1
human 1
beings 1
like 1
myself 1
and 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
upon 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
with 1
greater 1
composure 1
yet 1
still 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
like 1
a 1
death 1
knell 1
they 1
appeared 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
yet 1
distinct 1
and 1
oppressive 1
as 1
a 1
reality 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
far 1
descended 1
and 1
i 1
still 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
satisfying 1
my 1
appetite 1
which 1
had 1
become 1
ravenous 1
with 1
an 1
oaten 1
cake 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
fishing 1
boat 1
land 1
close 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
brought 1
me 1
a 1
packet 1
it 1
contained 1
letters 1
from 1
geneva 1
and 1
one 1
from 1
clerval 1
entreating 1
me 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
wearing 1
away 1
his 1
time 1
fruitlessly 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
that 1
letters 1
from 1
the 1
friends 1
he 1
had 1
formed 1
in 1
london 1
desired 1
his 1
return 1
to 1
complete 1
the 1
negotiation 1
they 1
had 1
entered 1
into 1
for 1
his 1
indian 1
enterprise 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
any 1
longer 1
delay 1
his 1
departure 1
but 1
as 1
his 1
journey 1
to 1
london 1
might 1
be 1
followed 1
even 1
sooner 1
than 1
he 1
now 1
conjectured 1
by 1
his 1
longer 1
voyage 1
he 1
entreated 1
me 1
to 1
bestow 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
my 1
society 1
on 1
him 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
spare 1
he 1
besought 1
me 1
therefore 1
to 1
leave 1
my 1
solitary 1
isle 1
and 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
at 1
perth 1
that 1
we 1
might 1
proceed 1
southwards 1
together 1
this 1
letter 1
in 1
a 1
degree 1
recalled 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
and 1
i 1
determined 1
to 1
quit 1
my 1
island 1
at 1
the 1
expiration 1
of 1
two 1
days 1
yet 1
before 1
i 1
departed 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
task 1
to 1
perform 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
shuddered 1
to 1
reflect 1
i 1
must 1
pack 1
up 1
my 1
chemical 1
instruments 1
and 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
i 1
must 1
enter 1
the 1
room 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
my 1
odious 1
work 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
handle 1
those 1
utensils 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
sickening 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
at 1
daybreak 1
i 1
summoned 1
sufficient 1
courage 1
and 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
laboratory 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
half 1
finished 1
creature 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
destroyed 1
lay 1
scattered 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
i 1
almost 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
mangled 1
the 1
living 1
flesh 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
i 1
paused 1
to 1
collect 1
myself 1
and 1
then 1
entered 1
the 1
chamber 1
with 1
trembling 1
hand 1
i 1
conveyed 1
the 1
instruments 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
i 1
reflected 1
that 1
i 1
ought 1
not 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
relics 1
of 1
my 1
work 1
to 1
excite 1
the 1
horror 1
and 1
suspicion 1
of 1
the 1
peasants 1
and 1
i 1
accordingly 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
basket 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
quantity 1
of 1
stones 1
and 1
laying 1
them 1
up 1
determined 1
to 1
throw 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
that 1
very 1
night 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
i 1
sat 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
employed 1
in 1
cleaning 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
chemical 1
apparatus 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
complete 1
than 1
the 1
alteration 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
my 1
feelings 1
since 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
regarded 1
my 1
promise 1
with 1
a 1
gloomy 1
despair 1
as 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
with 1
whatever 1
consequences 1
must 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
but 1
i 1
now 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
film 1
had 1
been 1
taken 1
from 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
saw 1
clearly 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
renewing 1
my 1
labours 1
did 1
not 1
for 1
one 1
instant 1
occur 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
threat 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
weighed 1
on 1
my 1
thoughts 1
but 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
reflect 1
that 1
a 1
voluntary 1
act 1
of 1
mine 1
could 1
avert 1
it 1
i 1
had 1
resolved 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
mind 1
that 1
to 1
create 1
another 1
like 1
the 1
fiend 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
made 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
the 1
basest 1
and 1
most 1
atrocious 1
selfishness 1
and 1
i 1
banished 1
from 1
my 1
mind 1
every 1
thought 1
that 1
could 1
lead 1
to 1
a 1
different 1
conclusion 1
between 1
two 1
and 1
three 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
moon 1
rose 1
and 1
i 1
then 1
putting 1
my 1
basket 1
aboard 1
a 1
little 1
skiff 1
sailed 1
out 1
about 1
four 1
miles 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
perfectly 1
solitary 1
a 1
few 1
boats 1
were 1
returning 1
towards 1
land 1
but 1
i 1
sailed 1
away 1
from 1
them 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
a 1
dreadful 1
crime 1
and 1
avoided 1
with 1
shuddering 1
anxiety 1
any 1
encounter 1
with 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
the 1
moon 1
which 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
clear 1
was 1
suddenly 1
overspread 1
by 1
a 1
thick 1
cloud 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
darkness 1
and 1
cast 1
my 1
basket 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
i 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
gurgling 1
sound 1
as 1
it 1
sank 1
and 1
then 1
sailed 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
the 1
sky 1
became 1
clouded 1
but 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
pure 1
although 1
chilled 1
by 1
the 1
northeast 1
breeze 1
that 1
was 1
then 1
rising 1
but 1
it 1
refreshed 1
me 1
and 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
such 1
agreeable 1
sensations 1
that 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
prolong 1
my 1
stay 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
fixing 1
the 1
rudder 1
in 1
a 1
direct 1
position 1
stretched 1
myself 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
clouds 1
hid 1
the 1
moon 1
everything 1
was 1
obscure 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
only 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
as 1
its 1
keel 1
cut 1
through 1
the 1
waves 1
the 1
murmur 1
lulled 1
me 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
i 1
slept 1
soundly 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
long 1
i 1
remained 1
in 1
this 1
situation 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
awoke 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
already 1
mounted 1
considerably 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
high 1
and 1
the 1
waves 1
continually 1
threatened 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
my 1
little 1
skiff 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
northeast 1
and 1
must 1
have 1
driven 1
me 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
coast 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
embarked 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
course 1
but 1
quickly 1
found 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
again 1
made 1
the 1
attempt 1
the 1
boat 1
would 1
be 1
instantly 1
filled 1
with 1
water 1
thus 1
situated 1
my 1
only 1
resource 1
was 1
to 1
drive 1
before 1
the 1
wind 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
few 1
sensations 1
of 1
terror 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
compass 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
so 1
slenderly 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
geography 1
of 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
of 1
little 1
benefit 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
might 1
be 1
driven 1
into 1
the 1
wide 1
atlantic 1
and 1
feel 1
all 1
the 1
tortures 1
of 1
starvation 1
or 1
be 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
immeasurable 1
waters 1
that 1
roared 1
and 1
buffeted 1
around 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
out 1
many 1
hours 1
and 1
felt 1
the 1
torment 1
of 1
a 1
burning 1
thirst 1
a 1
prelude 1
to 1
my 1
other 1
sufferings 1
i 1
looked 1
on 1
the 1
heavens 1
which 1
were 1
covered 1
by 1
clouds 1
that 1
flew 1
before 1
the 1
wind 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
replaced 1
by 1
others 1
i 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
sea 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
grave 1
fiend 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
your 1
task 1
is 1
already 1
fulfilled 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
of 1
clerval 1
all 1
left 1
behind 1
on 1
whom 1
the 1
monster 1
might 1
satisfy 1
his 1
sanguinary 1
and 1
merciless 1
passions 1
this 1
idea 1
plunged 1
me 1
into 1
a 1
reverie 1
so 1
despairing 1
and 1
frightful 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
when 1
the 1
scene 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
closing 1
before 1
me 1
forever 1
i 1
shudder 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
it 1
some 1
hours 1
passed 1
thus 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
declined 1
towards 1
the 1
horizon 1
the 1
wind 1
died 1
away 1
into 1
a 1
gentle 1
breeze 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
became 1
free 1
from 1
breakers 1
but 1
these 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
a 1
heavy 1
swell 1
i 1
felt 1
sick 1
and 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
hold 1
the 1
rudder 1
when 1
suddenly 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
high 1
land 1
towards 1
the 1
south 1
almost 1
spent 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
by 1
fatigue 1
and 1
the 1
dreadful 1
suspense 1
i 1
endured 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
this 1
sudden 1
certainty 1
of 1
life 1
rushed 1
like 1
a 1
flood 1
of 1
warm 1
joy 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
tears 1
gushed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
how 1
mutable 1
are 1
our 1
feelings 1
and 1
how 1
strange 1
is 1
that 1
clinging 1
love 1
we 1
have 1
of 1
life 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
misery 1
i 1
constructed 1
another 1
sail 1
with 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
dress 1
and 1
eagerly 1
steered 1
my 1
course 1
towards 1
the 1
land 1
it 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
and 1
rocky 1
appearance 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
approached 1
nearer 1
i 1
easily 1
perceived 1
the 1
traces 1
of 1
cultivation 1
i 1
saw 1
vessels 1
near 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
found 1
myself 1
suddenly 1
transported 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
civilized 1
man 1
i 1
carefully 1
traced 1
the 1
windings 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
hailed 1
a 1
steeple 1
which 1
i 1
at 1
length 1
saw 1
issuing 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
small 1
promontory 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
extreme 1
debility 1
i 1
resolved 1
to 1
sail 1
directly 1
towards 1
the 1
town 1
as 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
could 1
most 1
easily 1
procure 1
nourishment 1
fortunately 1
i 1
had 1
money 1
with 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
turned 1
the 1
promontory 1
i 1
perceived 1
a 1
small 1
neat 1
town 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
harbour 1
which 1
i 1
entered 1
my 1
heart 1
bounding 1
with 1
joy 1
at 1
my 1
unexpected 1
escape 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
occupied 1
in 1
fixing 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
arranging 1
the 1
sails 1
several 1
people 1
crowded 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
they 1
seemed 1
much 1
surprised 1
at 1
my 1
appearance 1
but 1
instead 1
of 1
offering 1
me 1
any 1
assistance 1
whispered 1
together 1
with 1
gestures 1
that 1
at 1
any 1
other 1
time 1
might 1
have 1
produced 1
in 1
me 1
a 1
slight 1
sensation 1
of 1
alarm 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
merely 1
remarked 1
that 1
they 1
spoke 1
english 1
and 1
i 1
therefore 1
addressed 1
them 1
in 1
that 1
language 1
my 1
good 1
friends 1
said 1
i 1
will 1
you 1
be 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
this 1
town 1
and 1
inform 1
me 1
where 1
i 1
am 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
that 1
soon 1
enough 1
replied 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
hoarse 1
voice 1
maybe 1
you 1
are 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
that 1
will 1
not 1
prove 1
much 1
to 1
your 1
taste 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
consulted 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
quarters 1
i 1
promise 1
you 1
i 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
surprised 1
on 1
receiving 1
so 1
rude 1
an 1
answer 1
from 1
a 1
stranger 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
also 1
disconcerted 1
on 1
perceiving 1
the 1
frowning 1
and 1
angry 1
countenances 1
of 1
his 1
companions 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
answer 1
me 1
so 1
roughly 1
i 1
replied 1
surely 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
englishmen 1
to 1
receive 1
strangers 1
so 1
inhospitably 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
said 1
the 1
man 1
what 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
the 1
english 1
may 1
be 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
the 1
irish 1
to 1
hate 1
villains 1
while 1
this 1
strange 1
dialogue 1
continued 1
i 1
perceived 1
the 1
crowd 1
rapidly 1
increase 1
their 1
faces 1
expressed 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
curiosity 1
and 1
anger 1
which 1
annoyed 1
and 1
in 1
some 1
degree 1
alarmed 1
me 1
i 1
inquired 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
replied 1
i 1
then 1
moved 1
forward 1
and 1
a 1
murmuring 1
sound 1
arose 1
from 1
the 1
crowd 1
as 1
they 1
followed 1
and 1
surrounded 1
me 1
when 1
an 1
ill 1
looking 1
man 1
approaching 1
tapped 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
shoulder 1
and 1
said 1
come 1
sir 1
you 1
must 1
follow 1
me 1
to 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
s 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
yourself 1
who 1
is 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
why 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
myself 1
is 1
not 1
this 1
a 1
free 1
country 1
ay 1
sir 1
free 1
enough 1
for 1
honest 1
folks 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
is 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
give 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
a 1
gentleman 1
who 1
was 1
found 1
murdered 1
here 1
last 1
night 1
this 1
answer 1
startled 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
presently 1
recovered 1
myself 1
i 1
was 1
innocent 1
that 1
could 1
easily 1
be 1
proved 1
accordingly 1
i 1
followed 1
my 1
conductor 1
in 1
silence 1
and 1
was 1
led 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
houses 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
i 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
sink 1
from 1
fatigue 1
and 1
hunger 1
but 1
being 1
surrounded 1
by 1
a 1
crowd 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
politic 1
to 1
rouse 1
all 1
my 1
strength 1
that 1
no 1
physical 1
debility 1
might 1
be 1
construed 1
into 1
apprehension 1
or 1
conscious 1
guilt 1
little 1
did 1
i 1
then 1
expect 1
the 1
calamity 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
me 1
and 1
extinguish 1
in 1
horror 1
and 1
despair 1
all 1
fear 1
of 1
ignominy 1
or 1
death 1
i 1
must 1
pause 1
here 1
for 1
it 1
requires 1
all 1
my 1
fortitude 1
to 1
recall 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
frightful 1
events 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
to 1
relate 1
in 1
proper 1
detail 1
to 1
my 1
recollection 1
chapter 1
21 1
i 1
was 1
soon 1
introduced 1
into 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
magistrate 1
an 1
old 1
benevolent 1
man 1
with 1
calm 1
and 1
mild 1
manners 1
he 1
looked 1
upon 1
me 1
however 1
with 1
some 1
degree 1
of 1
severity 1
and 1
then 1
turning 1
towards 1
my 1
conductors 1
he 1
asked 1
who 1
appeared 1
as 1
witnesses 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
about 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
men 1
came 1
forward 1
and 1
one 1
being 1
selected 1
by 1
the 1
magistrate 1
he 1
deposed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
fishing 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
with 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
brother 1
in 1
law 1
daniel 1
nugent 1
when 1
about 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
they 1
observed 1
a 1
strong 1
northerly 1
blast 1
rising 1
and 1
they 1
accordingly 1
put 1
in 1
for 1
port 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
dark 1
night 1
as 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
risen 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
land 1
at 1
the 1
harbour 1
but 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
accustomed 1
at 1
a 1
creek 1
about 1
two 1
miles 1
below 1
he 1
walked 1
on 1
first 1
carrying 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
fishing 1
tackle 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
followed 1
him 1
at 1
some 1
distance 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
proceeding 1
along 1
the 1
sands 1
he 1
struck 1
his 1
foot 1
against 1
something 1
and 1
fell 1
at 1
his 1
length 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
his 1
companions 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
assist 1
him 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
their 1
lantern 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
fallen 1
on 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
to 1
all 1
appearance 1
dead 1
their 1
first 1
supposition 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
some 1
person 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
drowned 1
and 1
was 1
thrown 1
on 1
shore 1
by 1
the 1
waves 1
but 1
on 1
examination 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
clothes 1
were 1
not 1
wet 1
and 1
even 1
that 1
the 1
body 1
was 1
not 1
then 1
cold 1
they 1
instantly 1
carried 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
cottage 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
restore 1
it 1
to 1
life 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
handsome 1
young 1
man 1
about 1
five 1
and 1
twenty 1
years 1
of 1
age 1
he 1
had 1
apparently 1
been 1
strangled 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
any 1
violence 1
except 1
the 1
black 1
mark 1
of 1
fingers 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
the 1
first 1
part 1
of 1
this 1
deposition 1
did 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
interest 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
mark 1
of 1
the 1
fingers 1
was 1
mentioned 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
my 1
brother 1
and 1
felt 1
myself 1
extremely 1
agitated 1
my 1
limbs 1
trembled 1
and 1
a 1
mist 1
came 1
over 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
obliged 1
me 1
to 1
lean 1
on 1
a 1
chair 1
for 1
support 1
the 1
magistrate 1
observed 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
keen 1
eye 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
drew 1
an 1
unfavourable 1
augury 1
from 1
my 1
manner 1
the 1
son 1
confirmed 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
account 1
but 1
when 1
daniel 1
nugent 1
was 1
called 1
he 1
swore 1
positively 1
that 1
just 1
before 1
the 1
fall 1
of 1
his 1
companion 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
at 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
judge 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
stars 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
boat 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
just 1
landed 1
a 1
woman 1
deposed 1
that 1
she 1
lived 1
near 1
the 1
beach 1
and 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
her 1
cottage 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
return 1
of 1
the 1
fishermen 1
about 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
she 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
man 1
in 1
it 1
push 1
off 1
from 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
shore 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
was 1
afterwards 1
found 1
another 1
woman 1
confirmed 1
the 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
fishermen 1
having 1
brought 1
the 1
body 1
into 1
her 1
house 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
cold 1
they 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
and 1
daniel 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
town 1
for 1
an 1
apothecary 1
but 1
life 1
was 1
quite 1
gone 1
several 1
other 1
men 1
were 1
examined 1
concerning 1
my 1
landing 1
and 1
they 1
agreed 1
that 1
with 1
the 1
strong 1
north 1
wind 1
that 1
had 1
arisen 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
probable 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
beaten 1
about 1
for 1
many 1
hours 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
obliged 1
to 1
return 1
nearly 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
spot 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
departed 1
besides 1
they 1
observed 1
that 1
it 1
appeared 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
brought 1
the 1
body 1
from 1
another 1
place 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
likely 1
that 1
as 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
shore 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
put 1
into 1
the 1
harbour 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
of 1
from 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
had 1
deposited 1
the 1
corpse 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
evidence 1
desired 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
body 1
lay 1
for 1
interment 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
observed 1
what 1
effect 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
it 1
would 1
produce 1
upon 1
me 1
this 1
idea 1
was 1
probably 1
suggested 1
by 1
the 1
extreme 1
agitation 1
i 1
had 1
exhibited 1
when 1
the 1
mode 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
had 1
been 1
described 1
i 1
was 1
accordingly 1
conducted 1
by 1
the 1
magistrate 1
and 1
several 1
other 1
persons 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
being 1
struck 1
by 1
the 1
strange 1
coincidences 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
during 1
this 1
eventful 1
night 1
but 1
knowing 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
conversing 1
with 1
several 1
persons 1
in 1
the 1
island 1
i 1
had 1
inhabited 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
body 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
i 1
was 1
perfectly 1
tranquil 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
i 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
lay 1
and 1
was 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
coffin 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
describe 1
my 1
sensations 1
on 1
beholding 1
it 1
i 1
feel 1
yet 1
parched 1
with 1
horror 1
nor 1
can 1
i 1
reflect 1
on 1
that 1
terrible 1
moment 1
without 1
shuddering 1
and 1
agony 1
the 1
examination 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
magistrate 1
and 1
witnesses 1
passed 1
like 1
a 1
dream 1
from 1
my 1
memory 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
henry 1
clerval 1
stretched 1
before 1
me 1
i 1
gasped 1
for 1
breath 1
and 1
throwing 1
myself 1
on 1
the 1
body 1
i 1
exclaimed 1
have 1
my 1
murderous 1
machinations 1
deprived 1
you 1
also 1
my 1
dearest 1
henry 1
of 1
life 1
two 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
destroyed 1
other 1
victims 1
await 1
their 1
destiny 1
but 1
you 1
clerval 1
my 1
friend 1
my 1
benefactor 1
the 1
human 1
frame 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
support 1
the 1
agonies 1
that 1
i 1
endured 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
carried 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
strong 1
convulsions 1
a 1
fever 1
succeeded 1
to 1
this 1
i 1
lay 1
for 1
two 1
months 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
death 1
my 1
ravings 1
as 1
i 1
afterwards 1
heard 1
were 1
frightful 1
i 1
called 1
myself 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
william 1
of 1
justine 1
and 1
of 1
clerval 1
sometimes 1
i 1
entreated 1
my 1
attendants 1
to 1
assist 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
by 1
whom 1
i 1
was 1
tormented 1
and 1
at 1
others 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
fingers 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
already 1
grasping 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
screamed 1
aloud 1
with 1
agony 1
and 1
terror 1
fortunately 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
my 1
native 1
language 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
alone 1
understood 1
me 1
but 1
my 1
gestures 1
and 1
bitter 1
cries 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
affright 1
the 1
other 1
witnesses 1
why 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
die 1
more 1
miserable 1
than 1
man 1
ever 1
was 1
before 1
why 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
sink 1
into 1
forgetfulness 1
and 1
rest 1
death 1
snatches 1
away 1
many 1
blooming 1
children 1
the 1
only 1
hopes 1
of 1
their 1
doting 1
parents 1
how 1
many 1
brides 1
and 1
youthful 1
lovers 1
have 1
been 1
one 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
bloom 1
of 1
health 1
and 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
a 1
prey 1
for 1
worms 1
and 1
the 1
decay 1
of 1
the 1
tomb 1
of 1
what 1
materials 1
was 1
i 1
made 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
thus 1
resist 1
so 1
many 1
shocks 1
which 1
like 1
the 1
turning 1
of 1
the 1
wheel 1
continually 1
renewed 1
the 1
torture 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
doomed 1
to 1
live 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
months 1
found 1
myself 1
as 1
awaking 1
from 1
a 1
dream 1
in 1
a 1
prison 1
stretched 1
on 1
a 1
wretched 1
bed 1
surrounded 1
by 1
jailers 1
turnkeys 1
bolts 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
miserable 1
apparatus 1
of 1
a 1
dungeon 1
it 1
was 1
morning 1
i 1
remember 1
when 1
i 1
thus 1
awoke 1
to 1
understanding 1
i 1
had 1
forgotten 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
only 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
some 1
great 1
misfortune 1
had 1
suddenly 1
overwhelmed 1
me 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
looked 1
around 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
barred 1
windows 1
and 1
the 1
squalidness 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
all 1
flashed 1
across 1
my 1
memory 1
and 1
i 1
groaned 1
bitterly 1
this 1
sound 1
disturbed 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
who 1
was 1
sleeping 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
beside 1
me 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
hired 1
nurse 1
the 1
wife 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
turnkeys 1
and 1
her 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
all 1
those 1
bad 1
qualities 1
which 1
often 1
characterize 1
that 1
class 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
her 1
face 1
were 1
hard 1
and 1
rude 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
persons 1
accustomed 1
to 1
see 1
without 1
sympathizing 1
in 1
sights 1
of 1
misery 1
her 1
tone 1
expressed 1
her 1
entire 1
indifference 1
she 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
english 1
and 1
the 1
voice 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
one 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
during 1
my 1
sufferings 1
are 1
you 1
better 1
now 1
sir 1
said 1
she 1
i 1
replied 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
language 1
with 1
a 1
feeble 1
voice 1
i 1
believe 1
i 1
am 1
but 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
all 1
true 1
if 1
indeed 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
dream 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
still 1
alive 1
to 1
feel 1
this 1
misery 1
and 1
horror 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
replied 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
if 1
you 1
mean 1
about 1
the 1
gentleman 1
you 1
murdered 1
i 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
were 1
better 1
for 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
dead 1
for 1
i 1
fancy 1
it 1
will 1
go 1
hard 1
with 1
you 1
however 1
that 1
s 1
none 1
of 1
my 1
business 1
i 1
am 1
sent 1
to 1
nurse 1
you 1
and 1
get 1
you 1
well 1
i 1
do 1
my 1
duty 1
with 1
a 1
safe 1
conscience 1
it 1
were 1
well 1
if 1
everybody 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
i 1
turned 1
with 1
loathing 1
from 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
could 1
utter 1
so 1
unfeeling 1
a 1
speech 1
to 1
a 1
person 1
just 1
saved 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
edge 1
of 1
death 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
languid 1
and 1
unable 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
whole 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
dream 1
i 1
sometimes 1
doubted 1
if 1
indeed 1
it 1
were 1
all 1
true 1
for 1
it 1
never 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
mind 1
with 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
reality 1
as 1
the 1
images 1
that 1
floated 1
before 1
me 1
became 1
more 1
distinct 1
i 1
grew 1
feverish 1
a 1
darkness 1
pressed 1
around 1
me 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
near 1
me 1
who 1
soothed 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
gentle 1
voice 1
of 1
love 1
no 1
dear 1
hand 1
supported 1
me 1
the 1
physician 1
came 1
and 1
prescribed 1
medicines 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
prepared 1
them 1
for 1
me 1
but 1
utter 1
carelessness 1
was 1
visible 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
the 1
expression 1
of 1
brutality 1
was 1
strongly 1
marked 1
in 1
the 1
visage 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
who 1
could 1
be 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
a 1
murderer 1
but 1
the 1
hangman 1
who 1
would 1
gain 1
his 1
fee 1
these 1
were 1
my 1
first 1
reflections 1
but 1
i 1
soon 1
learned 1
that 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
had 1
shown 1
me 1
extreme 1
kindness 1
he 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
best 1
room 1
in 1
the 1
prison 1
to 1
be 1
prepared 1
for 1
me 1
wretched 1
indeed 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
had 1
provided 1
a 1
physician 1
and 1
a 1
nurse 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
he 1
seldom 1
came 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
for 1
although 1
he 1
ardently 1
desired 1
to 1
relieve 1
the 1
sufferings 1
of 1
every 1
human 1
creature 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
present 1
at 1
the 1
agonies 1
and 1
miserable 1
ravings 1
of 1
a 1
murderer 1
he 1
came 1
therefore 1
sometimes 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
neglected 1
but 1
his 1
visits 1
were 1
short 1
and 1
with 1
long 1
intervals 1
one 1
day 1
while 1
i 1
was 1
gradually 1
recovering 1
i 1
was 1
seated 1
in 1
a 1
chair 1
my 1
eyes 1
half 1
open 1
and 1
my 1
cheeks 1
livid 1
like 1
those 1
in 1
death 1
i 1
was 1
overcome 1
by 1
gloom 1
and 1
misery 1
and 1
often 1
reflected 1
i 1
had 1
better 1
seek 1
death 1
than 1
desire 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
a 1
world 1
which 1
to 1
me 1
was 1
replete 1
with 1
wretchedness 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
i 1
considered 1
whether 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
declare 1
myself 1
guilty 1
and 1
suffer 1
the 1
penalty 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
less 1
innocent 1
than 1
poor 1
justine 1
had 1
been 1
such 1
were 1
my 1
thoughts 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
apartment 1
was 1
opened 1
and 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
entered 1
his 1
countenance 1
expressed 1
sympathy 1
and 1
compassion 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
chair 1
close 1
to 1
mine 1
and 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
french 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
this 1
place 1
is 1
very 1
shocking 1
to 1
you 1
can 1
i 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
make 1
you 1
more 1
comfortable 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
mention 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
earth 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
comfort 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
capable 1
of 1
receiving 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
sympathy 1
of 1
a 1
stranger 1
can 1
be 1
but 1
of 1
little 1
relief 1
to 1
one 1
borne 1
down 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
by 1
so 1
strange 1
a 1
misfortune 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
i 1
hope 1
soon 1
quit 1
this 1
melancholy 1
abode 1
for 1
doubtless 1
evidence 1
can 1
easily 1
be 1
brought 1
to 1
free 1
you 1
from 1
the 1
criminal 1
charge 1
that 1
is 1
my 1
least 1
concern 1
i 1
am 1
by 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
strange 1
events 1
become 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
of 1
mortals 1
persecuted 1
and 1
tortured 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
and 1
have 1
been 1
can 1
death 1
be 1
any 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
nothing 1
indeed 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
agonizing 1
than 1
the 1
strange 1
chances 1
that 1
have 1
lately 1
occurred 1
you 1
were 1
thrown 1
by 1
some 1
surprising 1
accident 1
on 1
this 1
shore 1
renowned 1
for 1
its 1
hospitality 1
seized 1
immediately 1
and 1
charged 1
with 1
murder 1
the 1
first 1
sight 1
that 1
was 1
presented 1
to 1
your 1
eyes 1
was 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
your 1
friend 1
murdered 1
in 1
so 1
unaccountable 1
a 1
manner 1
and 1
placed 1
as 1
it 1
were 1
by 1
some 1
fiend 1
across 1
your 1
path 1
as 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
said 1
this 1
notwithstanding 1
the 1
agitation 1
i 1
endured 1
on 1
this 1
retrospect 1
of 1
my 1
sufferings 1
i 1
also 1
felt 1
considerable 1
surprise 1
at 1
the 1
knowledge 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
possess 1
concerning 1
me 1
i 1
suppose 1
some 1
astonishment 1
was 1
exhibited 1
in 1
my 1
countenance 1
for 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
hastened 1
to 1
say 1
immediately 1
upon 1
your 1
being 1
taken 1
ill 1
all 1
the 1
papers 1
that 1
were 1
on 1
your 1
person 1
were 1
brought 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
examined 1
them 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
discover 1
some 1
trace 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
send 1
to 1
your 1
relations 1
an 1
account 1
of 1
your 1
misfortune 1
and 1
illness 1
i 1
found 1
several 1
letters 1
and 1
among 1
others 1
one 1
which 1
i 1
discovered 1
from 1
its 1
commencement 1
to 1
be 1
from 1
your 1
father 1
i 1
instantly 1
wrote 1
to 1
geneva 1
nearly 1
two 1
months 1
have 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
departure 1
of 1
my 1
letter 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
ill 1
even 1
now 1
you 1
tremble 1
you 1
are 1
unfit 1
for 1
agitation 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
this 1
suspense 1
is 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
worse 1
than 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
event 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
new 1
scene 1
of 1
death 1
has 1
been 1
acted 1
and 1
whose 1
murder 1
i 1
am 1
now 1
to 1
lament 1
your 1
family 1
is 1
perfectly 1
well 1
said 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
with 1
gentleness 1
and 1
someone 1
a 1
friend 1
is 1
come 1
to 1
visit 1
you 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
by 1
what 1
chain 1
of 1
thought 1
the 1
idea 1
presented 1
itself 1
but 1
it 1
instantly 1
darted 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
the 1
murderer 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
mock 1
at 1
my 1
misery 1
and 1
taunt 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
clerval 1
as 1
a 1
new 1
incitement 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
his 1
hellish 1
desires 1
i 1
put 1
my 1
hand 1
before 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
cried 1
out 1
in 1
agony 1
oh 1
take 1
him 1
away 1
i 1
cannot 1
see 1
him 1
for 1
god 1
s 1
sake 1
do 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
enter 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
regarded 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
troubled 1
countenance 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
regarding 1
my 1
exclamation 1
as 1
a 1
presumption 1
of 1
my 1
guilt 1
and 1
said 1
in 1
rather 1
a 1
severe 1
tone 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
thought 1
young 1
man 1
that 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
your 1
father 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
welcome 1
instead 1
of 1
inspiring 1
such 1
violent 1
repugnance 1
my 1
father 1
cried 1
i 1
while 1
every 1
feature 1
and 1
every 1
muscle 1
was 1
relaxed 1
from 1
anguish 1
to 1
pleasure 1
is 1
my 1
father 1
indeed 1
come 1
how 1
kind 1
how 1
very 1
kind 1
but 1
where 1
is 1
he 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
not 1
hasten 1
to 1
me 1
my 1
change 1
of 1
manner 1
surprised 1
and 1
pleased 1
the 1
magistrate 1
perhaps 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
my 1
former 1
exclamation 1
was 1
a 1
momentary 1
return 1
of 1
delirium 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
instantly 1
resumed 1
his 1
former 1
benevolence 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
quitted 1
the 1
room 1
with 1
my 1
nurse 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
my 1
father 1
entered 1
it 1
nothing 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
could 1
have 1
given 1
me 1
greater 1
pleasure 1
than 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
i 1
stretched 1
out 1
my 1
hand 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
cried 1
are 1
you 1
then 1
safe 1
and 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
ernest 1
my 1
father 1
calmed 1
me 1
with 1
assurances 1
of 1
their 1
welfare 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
by 1
dwelling 1
on 1
these 1
subjects 1
so 1
interesting 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
to 1
raise 1
my 1
desponding 1
spirits 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
felt 1
that 1
a 1
prison 1
cannot 1
be 1
the 1
abode 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
what 1
a 1
place 1
is 1
this 1
that 1
you 1
inhabit 1
my 1
son 1
said 1
he 1
looking 1
mournfully 1
at 1
the 1
barred 1
windows 1
and 1
wretched 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
you 1
travelled 1
to 1
seek 1
happiness 1
but 1
a 1
fatality 1
seems 1
to 1
pursue 1
you 1
and 1
poor 1
clerval 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
and 1
murdered 1
friend 1
was 1
an 1
agitation 1
too 1
great 1
to 1
be 1
endured 1
in 1
my 1
weak 1
state 1
i 1
shed 1
tears 1
alas 1
yes 1
my 1
father 1
replied 1
i 1
some 1
destiny 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
kind 1
hangs 1
over 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
live 1
to 1
fulfil 1
it 1
or 1
surely 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
died 1
on 1
the 1
coffin 1
of 1
henry 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
allowed 1
to 1
converse 1
for 1
any 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
for 1
the 1
precarious 1
state 1
of 1
my 1
health 1
rendered 1
every 1
precaution 1
necessary 1
that 1
could 1
ensure 1
tranquillity 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
came 1
in 1
and 1
insisted 1
that 1
my 1
strength 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
exhausted 1
by 1
too 1
much 1
exertion 1
but 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
to 1
me 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
good 1
angel 1
and 1
i 1
gradually 1
recovered 1
my 1
health 1
as 1
my 1
sickness 1
quitted 1
me 1
i 1
was 1
absorbed 1
by 1
a 1
gloomy 1
and 1
black 1
melancholy 1
that 1
nothing 1
could 1
dissipate 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
clerval 1
was 1
forever 1
before 1
me 1
ghastly 1
and 1
murdered 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
the 1
agitation 1
into 1
which 1
these 1
reflections 1
threw 1
me 1
made 1
my 1
friends 1
dread 1
a 1
dangerous 1
relapse 1
alas 1
why 1
did 1
they 1
preserve 1
so 1
miserable 1
and 1
detested 1
a 1
life 1
it 1
was 1
surely 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
fulfil 1
my 1
destiny 1
which 1
is 1
now 1
drawing 1
to 1
a 1
close 1
soon 1
oh 1
very 1
soon 1
will 1
death 1
extinguish 1
these 1
throbbings 1
and 1
relieve 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
mighty 1
weight 1
of 1
anguish 1
that 1
bears 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
dust 1
and 1
in 1
executing 1
the 1
award 1
of 1
justice 1
i 1
shall 1
also 1
sink 1
to 1
rest 1
then 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
death 1
was 1
distant 1
although 1
the 1
wish 1
was 1
ever 1
present 1
to 1
my 1
thoughts 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
sat 1
for 1
hours 1
motionless 1
and 1
speechless 1
wishing 1
for 1
some 1
mighty 1
revolution 1
that 1
might 1
bury 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
destroyer 1
in 1
its 1
ruins 1
the 1
season 1
of 1
the 1
assizes 1
approached 1
i 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
three 1
months 1
in 1
prison 1
and 1
although 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
weak 1
and 1
in 1
continual 1
danger 1
of 1
a 1
relapse 1
i 1
was 1
obliged 1
to 1
travel 1
nearly 1
a 1
hundred 1
miles 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
town 1
where 1
the 1
court 1
was 1
held 1
mr 1
kirwin 1
charged 1
himself 1
with 1
every 1
care 1
of 1
collecting 1
witnesses 1
and 1
arranging 1
my 1
defence 1
i 1
was 1
spared 1
the 1
disgrace 1
of 1
appearing 1
publicly 1
as 1
a 1
criminal 1
as 1
the 1
case 1
was 1
not 1
brought 1
before 1
the 1
court 1
that 1
decides 1
on 1
life 1
and 1
death 1
the 1
grand 1
jury 1
rejected 1
the 1
bill 1
on 1
its 1
being 1
proved 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
orkney 1
islands 1
at 1
the 1
hour 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
was 1
found 1
and 1
a 1
fortnight 1
after 1
my 1
removal 1
i 1
was 1
liberated 1
from 1
prison 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
enraptured 1
on 1
finding 1
me 1
freed 1
from 1
the 1
vexations 1
of 1
a 1
criminal 1
charge 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
again 1
allowed 1
to 1
breathe 1
the 1
fresh 1
atmosphere 1
and 1
permitted 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
participate 1
in 1
these 1
feelings 1
for 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
a 1
dungeon 1
or 1
a 1
palace 1
were 1
alike 1
hateful 1
the 1
cup 1
of 1
life 1
was 1
poisoned 1
forever 1
and 1
although 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
upon 1
me 1
as 1
upon 1
the 1
happy 1
and 1
gay 1
of 1
heart 1
i 1
saw 1
around 1
me 1
nothing 1
but 1
a 1
dense 1
and 1
frightful 1
darkness 1
penetrated 1
by 1
no 1
light 1
but 1
the 1
glimmer 1
of 1
two 1
eyes 1
that 1
glared 1
upon 1
me 1
sometimes 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
expressive 1
eyes 1
of 1
henry 1
languishing 1
in 1
death 1
the 1
dark 1
orbs 1
nearly 1
covered 1
by 1
the 1
lids 1
and 1
the 1
long 1
black 1
lashes 1
that 1
fringed 1
them 1
sometimes 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
watery 1
clouded 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
as 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
them 1
in 1
my 1
chamber 1
at 1
ingolstadt 1
my 1
father 1
tried 1
to 1
awaken 1
in 1
me 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
affection 1
he 1
talked 1
of 1
geneva 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
visit 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
ernest 1
but 1
these 1
words 1
only 1
drew 1
deep 1
groans 1
from 1
me 1
sometimes 1
indeed 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
wish 1
for 1
happiness 1
and 1
thought 1
with 1
melancholy 1
delight 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
cousin 1
or 1
longed 1
with 1
a 1
devouring 1
maladie 1
du 1
pays 1
to 1
see 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
blue 1
lake 1
and 1
rapid 1
rhone 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
early 1
childhood 1
but 1
my 1
general 1
state 1
of 1
feeling 1
was 1
a 1
torpor 1
in 1
which 1
a 1
prison 1
was 1
as 1
welcome 1
a 1
residence 1
as 1
the 1
divinest 1
scene 1
in 1
nature 1
and 1
these 1
fits 1
were 1
seldom 1
interrupted 1
but 1
by 1
paroxysms 1
of 1
anguish 1
and 1
despair 1
at 1
these 1
moments 1
i 1
often 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
existence 1
i 1
loathed 1
and 1
it 1
required 1
unceasing 1
attendance 1
and 1
vigilance 1
to 1
restrain 1
me 1
from 1
committing 1
some 1
dreadful 1
act 1
of 1
violence 1
yet 1
one 1
duty 1
remained 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
which 1
finally 1
triumphed 1
over 1
my 1
selfish 1
despair 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
return 1
without 1
delay 1
to 1
geneva 1
there 1
to 1
watch 1
over 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
those 1
i 1
so 1
fondly 1
loved 1
and 1
to 1
lie 1
in 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
murderer 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
chance 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
his 1
concealment 1
or 1
if 1
he 1
dared 1
again 1
to 1
blast 1
me 1
by 1
his 1
presence 1
i 1
might 1
with 1
unfailing 1
aim 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
monstrous 1
image 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
endued 1
with 1
the 1
mockery 1
of 1
a 1
soul 1
still 1
more 1
monstrous 1
my 1
father 1
still 1
desired 1
to 1
delay 1
our 1
departure 1
fearful 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sustain 1
the 1
fatigues 1
of 1
a 1
journey 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
shattered 1
wreck 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
my 1
strength 1
was 1
gone 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
mere 1
skeleton 1
and 1
fever 1
night 1
and 1
day 1
preyed 1
upon 1
my 1
wasted 1
frame 1
still 1
as 1
i 1
urged 1
our 1
leaving 1
ireland 1
with 1
such 1
inquietude 1
and 1
impatience 1
my 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
best 1
to 1
yield 1
we 1
took 1
our 1
passage 1
on 1
board 1
a 1
vessel 1
bound 1
for 1
havre 1
de 1
grace 1
and 1
sailed 1
with 1
a 1
fair 1
wind 1
from 1
the 1
irish 1
shores 1
it 1
was 1
midnight 1
i 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
deck 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
stars 1
and 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
dashing 1
of 1
the 1
waves 1
i 1
hailed 1
the 1
darkness 1
that 1
shut 1
ireland 1
from 1
my 1
sight 1
and 1
my 1
pulse 1
beat 1
with 1
a 1
feverish 1
joy 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
see 1
geneva 1
the 1
past 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
frightful 1
dream 1
yet 1
the 1
vessel 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
wind 1
that 1
blew 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
detested 1
shore 1
of 1
ireland 1
and 1
the 1
sea 1
which 1
surrounded 1
me 1
told 1
me 1
too 1
forcibly 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
deceived 1
by 1
no 1
vision 1
and 1
that 1
clerval 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
dearest 1
companion 1
had 1
fallen 1
a 1
victim 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
monster 1
of 1
my 1
creation 1
i 1
repassed 1
in 1
my 1
memory 1
my 1
whole 1
life 1
my 1
quiet 1
happiness 1
while 1
residing 1
with 1
my 1
family 1
in 1
geneva 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
my 1
departure 1
for 1
ingolstadt 1
i 1
remembered 1
shuddering 1
the 1
mad 1
enthusiasm 1
that 1
hurried 1
me 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
my 1
hideous 1
enemy 1
and 1
i 1
called 1
to 1
mind 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
first 1
lived 1
i 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
train 1
of 1
thought 1
a 1
thousand 1
feelings 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
ever 1
since 1
my 1
recovery 1
from 1
the 1
fever 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
custom 1
of 1
taking 1
every 1
night 1
a 1
small 1
quantity 1
of 1
laudanum 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
this 1
drug 1
only 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
enabled 1
to 1
gain 1
the 1
rest 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
preservation 1
of 1
life 1
oppressed 1
by 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
my 1
various 1
misfortunes 1
i 1
now 1
swallowed 1
double 1
my 1
usual 1
quantity 1
and 1
soon 1
slept 1
profoundly 1
but 1
sleep 1
did 1
not 1
afford 1
me 1
respite 1
from 1
thought 1
and 1
misery 1
my 1
dreams 1
presented 1
a 1
thousand 1
objects 1
that 1
scared 1
me 1
towards 1
morning 1
i 1
was 1
possessed 1
by 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
nightmare 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
fiend 1
s 1
grasp 1
in 1
my 1
neck 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
free 1
myself 1
from 1
it 1
groans 1
and 1
cries 1
rang 1
in 1
my 1
ears 1
my 1
father 1
who 1
was 1
watching 1
over 1
me 1
perceiving 1
my 1
restlessness 1
awoke 1
me 1
the 1
dashing 1
waves 1
were 1
around 1
the 1
cloudy 1

above 1
the 1
fiend 1
was 1
not 1
here 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
security 1
a 1
feeling 1
that 1
a 1
truce 1
was 1
established 1
between 1
the 1
present 1
hour 1
and 1
the 1
irresistible 1
disastrous 1
future 1
imparted 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
calm 1
forgetfulness 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
is 1

structure 1

the 1
voyage 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
end 1
we 1
landed 1
and 1
proceeded 1
to 1
paris 1
i 1
soon 1
found 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
overtaxed 1
my 1
strength 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
repose 1
before 1
i 1
could 1
continue 1
my 1
journey 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
care 1
and 1
attentions 1
were 1
indefatigable 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
origin 1
of 1
my 1
sufferings 1
and 1
sought 1
erroneous 1
methods 1
to 1
remedy 1
the 1
incurable 1
ill 1
he 1
wished 1
me 1
to 1
seek 1
amusement 1
in 1
society 1
i 1
abhorred 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
man 1
oh 1
not 1
abhorred 1
they 1
were 1
my 1
brethren 1
my 1
fellow 1
beings 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
attracted 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
repulsive 1
among 1
them 1
as 1
to 1
creatures 1
of 1
an 1
angelic 1
nature 1
and 1
celestial 1
mechanism 1
but 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
right 1
to 1
share 1
their 1
intercourse 1
i 1
had 1
unchained 1
an 1
enemy 1
among 1
them 1
whose 1
joy 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
shed 1
their 1
blood 1
and 1
to 1
revel 1
in 1
their 1
groans 1
how 1
they 1
would 1
each 1
and 1
all 1
abhor 1
me 1
and 1
hunt 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
did 1
they 1
know 1
my 1
unhallowed 1
acts 1
and 1
the 1
crimes 1
which 1
had 1
their 1
source 1
in 1
me 1
my 1
father 1
yielded 1
at 1
length 1
to 1
my 1
desire 1
to 1
avoid 1
society 1
and 1
strove 1
by 1
various 1
arguments 1
to 1
banish 1
my 1
despair 1
sometimes 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
felt 1
deeply 1
the 1
degradation 1
of 1
being 1
obliged 1
to 1
answer 1
a 1
charge 1
of 1
murder 1
and 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
prove 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
futility 1
of 1
pride 1
alas 1
my 1
father 1
said 1
i 1
how 1
little 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
human 1
beings 1
their 1
feelings 1
and 1
passions 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
degraded 1
if 1
such 1
a 1
wretch 1
as 1
i 1
felt 1
pride 1
justine 1
poor 1
unhappy 1
justine 1
was 1
as 1
innocent 1
as 1
i 1
and 1
she 1
suffered 1
the 1
same 1
charge 1
she 1
died 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
this 1
i 1
murdered 1
her 1
william 1
justine 1
and 1
henry 1
they 1
all 1
died 1
by 1
my 1
hands 1
my 1
father 1
had 1
often 1
during 1
my 1
imprisonment 1
heard 1
me 1
make 1
the 1
same 1
assertion 1
when 1
i 1
thus 1
accused 1
myself 1
he 1
sometimes 1
seemed 1
to 1
desire 1
an 1
explanation 1
and 1
at 1
others 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
consider 1
it 1
as 1
the 1
offspring 1
of 1
delirium 1
and 1
that 1
during 1
my 1
illness 1
some 1
idea 1
of 1
this 1
kind 1
had 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
imagination 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
preserved 1
in 1
my 1
convalescence 1
i 1
avoided 1
explanation 1
and 1
maintained 1
a 1
continual 1
silence 1
concerning 1
the 1
wretch 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
persuasion 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
supposed 1
mad 1
and 1
this 1
in 1
itself 1
would 1
forever 1
have 1
chained 1
my 1
tongue 1
but 1
besides 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
bring 1
myself 1
to 1
disclose 1
a 1
secret 1
which 1
would 1
fill 1
my 1
hearer 1
with 1
consternation 1
and 1
make 1
fear 1
and 1
unnatural 1
horror 1
the 1
inmates 1
of 1
his 1
breast 1
i 1
checked 1
therefore 1
my 1
impatient 1
thirst 1
for 1
sympathy 1
and 1
was 1
silent 1
when 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
have 1
confided 1
the 1
fatal 1
secret 1
yet 1
still 1
words 1
like 1
those 1
i 1
have 1
recorded 1
would 1
burst 1
uncontrollably 1
from 1
me 1
i 1
could 1
offer 1
no 1
explanation 1
of 1
them 1
but 1
their 1
truth 1
in 1
part 1
relieved 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
my 1
mysterious 1
woe 1
upon 1
this 1
occasion 1
my 1
father 1
said 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
unbounded 1
wonder 1
my 1
dearest 1
victor 1
what 1
infatuation 1
is 1
this 1
my 1
dear 1
son 1
i 1
entreat 1
you 1
never 1
to 1
make 1
such 1
an 1
assertion 1
again 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
mad 1
i 1
cried 1
energetically 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
the 1
heavens 1
who 1
have 1
viewed 1
my 1
operations 1
can 1
bear 1
witness 1
of 1
my 1
truth 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
assassin 1
of 1
those 1
most 1
innocent 1
victims 1
they 1
died 1
by 1
my 1
machinations 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
would 1
i 1
have 1
shed 1
my 1
own 1
blood 1
drop 1
by 1
drop 1
to 1
have 1
saved 1
their 1
lives 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
my 1
father 1
indeed 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
sacrifice 1
the 1
whole 1
human 1
race 1
the 1
conclusion 1
of 1
this 1
speech 1
convinced 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
my 1
ideas 1
were 1
deranged 1
and 1
he 1
instantly 1
changed 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
our 1
conversation 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
alter 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
my 1
thoughts 1
he 1
wished 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
obliterate 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
scenes 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
ireland 1
and 1
never 1
alluded 1
to 1
them 1
or 1
suffered 1
me 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
as 1
time 1
passed 1
away 1
i 1
became 1
more 1
calm 1
misery 1
had 1
her 1
dwelling 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
but 1
i 1
no 1
longer 1
talked 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
incoherent 1
manner 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
crimes 1
sufficient 1
for 1
me 1
was 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
them 1
by 1
the 1
utmost 1
self 1
violence 1
i 1
curbed 1
the 1
imperious 1
voice 1
of 1
wretchedness 1
which 1
sometimes 1
desired 1
to 1
declare 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
and 1
my 1
manners 1
were 1
calmer 1
and 1
more 1
composed 1
than 1
they 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
since 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
before 1
we 1
left 1
paris 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
to 1
switzerland 1
i 1
received 1
the 1
following 1
letter 1
from 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
dear 1
friend 1
it 1
gave 1
me 1
the 1
greatest 1
pleasure 1
to 1
receive 1
a 1
letter 1
from 1
my 1
uncle 1
dated 1
at 1
paris 1
you 1
are 1
no 1
longer 1
at 1
a 1
formidable 1
distance 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
in 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
fortnight 1
my 1
poor 1
cousin 1
how 1
much 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
suffered 1
i 1
expect 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
looking 1
even 1
more 1
ill 1
than 1
when 1
you 1
quitted 1
geneva 1
this 1
winter 1
has 1
been 1
passed 1
most 1
miserably 1
tortured 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
by 1
anxious 1
suspense 1
yet 1
i 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
peace 1
in 1
your 1
countenance 1
and 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
your 1
heart 1
is 1
not 1
totally 1
void 1
of 1
comfort 1
and 1
tranquillity 1
yet 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
feelings 1
now 1
exist 1
that 1
made 1
you 1
so 1
miserable 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
even 1
perhaps 1
augmented 1
by 1
time 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
disturb 1
you 1
at 1
this 1
period 1
when 1
so 1
many 1
misfortunes 1
weigh 1
upon 1
you 1
but 1
a 1
conversation 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
with 1
my 1
uncle 1
previous 1
to 1
his 1
departure 1
renders 1
some 1
explanation 1
necessary 1
before 1
we 1
meet 1
explanation 1
you 1
may 1
possibly 1
say 1
what 1
can 1
elizabeth 1
have 1
to 1
explain 1
if 1
you 1
really 1
say 1
this 1
my 1
questions 1
are 1
answered 1
and 1
all 1
my 1
doubts 1
satisfied 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
distant 1
from 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
dread 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
pleased 1
with 1
this 1
explanation 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
probability 1
of 1
this 1
being 1
the 1
case 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
any 1
longer 1
postpone 1
writing 1
what 1
during 1
your 1
absence 1
i 1
have 1
often 1
wished 1
to 1
express 1
to 1
you 1
but 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
begin 1
you 1
well 1
know 1
victor 1
that 1
our 1
union 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
favourite 1
plan 1
of 1
your 1
parents 1
ever 1
since 1
our 1
infancy 1
we 1
were 1
told 1
this 1
when 1
young 1
and 1
taught 1
to 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
it 1
as 1
an 1
event 1
that 1
would 1
certainly 1
take 1
place 1
we 1
were 1
affectionate 1
playfellows 1
during 1
childhood 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
dear 1
and 1
valued 1
friends 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
as 1
we 1
grew 1
older 1
but 1
as 1
brother 1
and 1
sister 1
often 1
entertain 1
a 1
lively 1
affection 1
towards 1
each 1
other 1
without 1
desiring 1
a 1
more 1
intimate 1
union 1
may 1
not 1
such 1
also 1
be 1
our 1
case 1
tell 1
me 1
dearest 1
victor 1
answer 1
me 1
i 1
conjure 1
you 1
by 1
our 1
mutual 1
happiness 1
with 1
simple 1
truth 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
love 1
another 1
you 1
have 1
travelled 1
you 1
have 1
spent 1
several 1
years 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
at 1
ingolstadt 1
and 1
i 1
confess 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
last 1
autumn 1
so 1
unhappy 1
flying 1
to 1
solitude 1
from 1
the 1
society 1
of 1
every 1
creature 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
supposing 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
regret 1
our 1
connection 1
and 1
believe 1
yourself 1
bound 1
in 1
honour 1
to 1
fulfil 1
the 1
wishes 1
of 1
your 1
parents 1
although 1
they 1
opposed 1
themselves 1
to 1
your 1
inclinations 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
false 1
reasoning 1
i 1
confess 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
friend 1
that 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
in 1
my 1
airy 1
dreams 1
of 1
futurity 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
my 1
constant 1
friend 1
and 1
companion 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
happiness 1
i 1
desire 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
my 1
own 1
when 1
i 1
declare 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
our 1
marriage 1
would 1
render 1
me 1
eternally 1
miserable 1
unless 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
dictate 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
free 1
choice 1
even 1
now 1
i 1
weep 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
borne 1
down 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
by 1
the 1
cruellest 1
misfortunes 1
you 1
may 1
stifle 1
by 1
the 1
word 1
honour 1
all 1
hope 1
of 1
that 1
love 1
and 1
happiness 1
which 1
would 1
alone 1
restore 1
you 1
to 1
yourself 1
i 1
who 1
have 1
so 1
disinterested 1
an 1
affection 1
for 1
you 1
may 1
increase 1
your 1
miseries 1
tenfold 1
by 1
being 1
an 1
obstacle 1
to 1
your 1
wishes 1
ah 1
victor 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
your 1
cousin 1
and 1
playmate 1
has 1
too 1
sincere 1
a 1
love 1
for 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
miserable 1
by 1
this 1
supposition 1
be 1
happy 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
obey 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
one 1
request 1
remain 1
satisfied 1
that 1
nothing 1
on 1
earth 1
will 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
interrupt 1
my 1
tranquillity 1
do 1
not 1
let 1
this 1
letter 1
disturb 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
answer 1
tomorrow 1
or 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
or 1
even 1
until 1
you 1
come 1
if 1
it 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
pain 1
my 1
uncle 1
will 1
send 1
me 1
news 1
of 1
your 1
health 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
see 1
but 1
one 1
smile 1
on 1
your 1
lips 1
when 1
we 1
meet 1
occasioned 1
by 1
this 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
exertion 1
of 1
mine 1

this 1
letter 1
revived 1
in 1
my 1
memory 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
before 1
forgotten 1
the 1
threat 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
wedding 1
night 1
such 1
was 1
my 1
sentence 1
and 1
on 1
that 1
night 1
would 1
the 1
daemon 1
employ 1
every 1
art 1
to 1
destroy 1
me 1
and 1
tear 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
glimpse 1
of 1
happiness 1
which 1
promised 1
partly 1
to 1
console 1
my 1
sufferings 1
on 1
that 1
night 1
he 1
had 1
determined 1
to 1
consummate 1
his 1
crimes 1
by 1
my 1
death 1
well 1
be 1
it 1
so 1
a 1
deadly 1
struggle 1
would 1
then 1
assuredly 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
which 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
victorious 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
peace 1
and 1
his 1
power 1
over 1
me 1
be 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
vanquished 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
a 1
free 1
man 1
alas 1
what 1
freedom 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
peasant 1
enjoys 1
when 1
his 1
family 1
have 1
been 1
massacred 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
his 1
cottage 1
burnt 1
his 1
lands 1
laid 1
waste 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
turned 1
adrift 1
homeless 1
penniless 1
and 1
alone 1
but 1
free 1
such 1
would 1
be 1
my 1
liberty 1
except 1
that 1
in 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
possessed 1
a 1
treasure 1
alas 1
balanced 1
by 1
those 1
horrors 1
of 1
remorse 1
and 1
guilt 1
which 1
would 1
pursue 1
me 1
until 1
death 1
sweet 1
and 1
beloved 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
read 1
and 1
reread 1
her 1
letter 1
and 1
some 1
softened 1
feelings 1
stole 1
into 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
dared 1
to 1
whisper 1
paradisiacal 1
dreams 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
joy 1
but 1
the 1
apple 1
was 1
already 1
eaten 1
and 1
the 1
angel 1
s 1
arm 1
bared 1
to 1
drive 1
me 1
from 1
all 1
hope 1
yet 1
i 1
would 1
die 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
happy 1
if 1
the 1
monster 1
executed 1
his 1
threat 1
death 1
was 1
inevitable 1
yet 1
again 1
i 1
considered 1
whether 1
my 1
marriage 1
would 1
hasten 1
my 1
fate 1
my 1
destruction 1
might 1
indeed 1
arrive 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
sooner 1
but 1
if 1
my 1
torturer 1
should 1
suspect 1
that 1
i 1
postponed 1
it 1
influenced 1
by 1
his 1
menaces 1
he 1
would 1
surely 1
find 1
other 1
and 1
perhaps 1
more 1
dreadful 1
means 1
of 1
revenge 1
he 1
had 1
vowed 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
me 1
on 1
my 1
wedding 1
night 1
yet 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
consider 1
that 1
threat 1
as 1
binding 1
him 1
to 1
peace 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
for 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
satiated 1
with 1
blood 1
he 1
had 1
murdered 1
clerval 1
immediately 1
after 1
the 1
enunciation 1
of 1
his 1
threats 1
i 1
resolved 1
therefore 1
that 1
if 1
my 1
immediate 1
union 1
with 1
my 1
cousin 1
would 1
conduce 1
either 1
to 1
hers 1
or 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
happiness 1
my 1
adversary 1
s 1
designs 1
against 1
my 1
life 1
should 1
not 1
retard 1
it 1
a 1
single 1
hour 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
i 1
wrote 1
to 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
letter 1
was 1
calm 1
and 1
affectionate 1
i 1
fear 1
my 1
beloved 1
girl 1
i 1
said 1
little 1
happiness 1
remains 1
for 1
us 1
on 1
earth 1
yet 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
one 1
day 1
enjoy 1
is 1
centred 1
in 1
you 1
chase 1
away 1
your 1
idle 1
fears 1
to 1
you 1
alone 1
do 1
i 1
consecrate 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
my 1
endeavours 1
for 1
contentment 1
i 1
have 1
one 1
secret 1
elizabeth 1
a 1
dreadful 1
one 1
when 1
revealed 1
to 1
you 1
it 1
will 1
chill 1
your 1
frame 1
with 1
horror 1
and 1
then 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
surprised 1
at 1
my 1
misery 1
you 1
will 1
only 1
wonder 1
that 1
i 1
survive 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
endured 1
i 1
will 1
confide 1
this 1
tale 1
of 1
misery 1
and 1
terror 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
our 1
marriage 1
shall 1
take 1
place 1
for 1
my 1
sweet 1
cousin 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
perfect 1
confidence 1
between 1
us 1
but 1
until 1
then 1
i 1
conjure 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
mention 1
or 1
allude 1
to 1
it 1
this 1
i 1
most 1
earnestly 1
entreat 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
will 1
comply 1
in 1
about 1
a 1
week 1
after 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
s 1
letter 1
we 1
returned 1
to 1
geneva 1
the 1
sweet 1
girl 1
welcomed 1
me 1
with 1
warm 1
affection 1
yet 1
tears 1
were 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
as 1
she 1
beheld 1
my 1
emaciated 1
frame 1
and 1
feverish 1
cheeks 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
also 1
she 1
was 1
thinner 1
and 1
had 1
lost 1
much 1
of 1
that 1
heavenly 1
vivacity 1
that 1
had 1
before 1
charmed 1
me 1
but 1
her 1
gentleness 1
and 1
soft 1
looks 1
of 1
compassion 1
made 1
her 1
a 1
more 1
fit 1
companion 1
for 1
one 1
blasted 1
and 1
miserable 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
tranquillity 1
which 1
i 1
now 1
enjoyed 1
did 1
not 1
endure 1
memory 1
brought 1
madness 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
a 1
real 1
insanity 1
possessed 1
me 1
sometimes 1
i 1
was 1
furious 1
and 1
burnt 1
with 1
rage 1
sometimes 1
low 1
and 1
despondent 1
i 1
neither 1
spoke 1
nor 1
looked 1
at 1
anyone 1
but 1
sat 1
motionless 1
bewildered 1
by 1
the 1
multitude 1
of 1
miseries 1
that 1
overcame 1
me 1
elizabeth 1
alone 1
had 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
draw 1
me 1
from 1
these 1
fits 1
her 1
gentle 1
voice 1
would 1
soothe 1
me 1
when 1
transported 1
by 1
passion 1
and 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
human 1
feelings 1
when 1
sunk 1
in 1
torpor 1
she 1
wept 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
for 1
me 1
when 1
reason 1
returned 1
she 1
would 1
remonstrate 1
and 1
endeavour 1
to 1
inspire 1
me 1
with 1
resignation 1
ah 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
for 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
to 1
be 1
resigned 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
guilty 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
peace 1
the 1
agonies 1
of 1
remorse 1
poison 1
the 1
luxury 1
there 1
is 1
otherwise 1
sometimes 1
found 1
in 1
indulging 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
grief 1
soon 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
my 1
father 1
spoke 1
of 1
my 1
immediate 1
marriage 1
with 1
elizabeth 1
i 1
remained 1
silent 1
have 1
you 1
then 1
some 1
other 1
attachment 1
none 1
on 1
earth 1
i 1
love 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
with 1
delight 1
let 1
the 1
day 1
therefore 1
be 1
fixed 1
and 1
on 1
it 1
i 1
will 1
consecrate 1
myself 1
in 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
to 1
the 1
happiness 1
of 1
my 1
cousin 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
do 1
not 1
speak 1
thus 1
heavy 1
misfortunes 1
have 1
befallen 1
us 1
but 1
let 1
us 1
only 1
cling 1
closer 1
to 1
what 1
remains 1
and 1
transfer 1
our 1
love 1
for 1
those 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
lost 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
yet 1
live 1
our 1
circle 1
will 1
be 1
small 1
but 1
bound 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
ties 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
mutual 1
misfortune 1
and 1
when 1
time 1
shall 1
have 1
softened 1
your 1
despair 1
new 1
and 1
dear 1
objects 1
of 1
care 1
will 1
be 1
born 1
to 1
replace 1
those 1
of 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
cruelly 1
deprived 1
such 1
were 1
the 1
lessons 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
the 1
threat 1
returned 1
nor 1
can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
omnipotent 1
as 1
the 1
fiend 1
had 1
yet 1
been 1
in 1
his 1
deeds 1
of 1
blood 1
i 1
should 1
almost 1
regard 1
him 1
as 1
invincible 1
and 1
that 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
pronounced 1
the 1
words 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
on 1
your 1
wedding 1
night 1
i 1
should 1
regard 1
the 1
threatened 1
fate 1
as 1
unavoidable 1
but 1
death 1
was 1
no 1
evil 1
to 1
me 1
if 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
were 1
balanced 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
therefore 1
with 1
a 1
contented 1
and 1
even 1
cheerful 1
countenance 1
agreed 1
with 1
my 1
father 1
that 1
if 1
my 1
cousin 1
would 1
consent 1
the 1
ceremony 1
should 1
take 1
place 1
in 1
ten 1
days 1
and 1
thus 1
put 1
as 1
i 1
imagined 1
the 1
seal 1
to 1
my 1
fate 1
great 1
god 1
if 1
for 1
one 1
instant 1
i 1
had 1
thought 1
what 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
hellish 1
intention 1
of 1
my 1
fiendish 1
adversary 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
have 1
banished 1
myself 1
forever 1
from 1
my 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
wandered 1
a 1
friendless 1
outcast 1
over 1
the 1
earth 1
than 1
have 1
consented 1
to 1
this 1
miserable 1
marriage 1
but 1
as 1
if 1
possessed 1
of 1
magic 1
powers 1
the 1
monster 1
had 1
blinded 1
me 1
to 1
his 1
real 1
intentions 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
prepared 1
only 1
my 1
own 1
death 1
i 1
hastened 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
far 1
dearer 1
victim 1
as 1
the 1
period 1
fixed 1
for 1
our 1
marriage 1
drew 1
nearer 1
whether 1
from 1
cowardice 1
or 1
a 1
prophetic 1
feeling 1
i 1
felt 1
my 1
heart 1
sink 1
within 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
concealed 1
my 1
feelings 1
by 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
hilarity 1
that 1
brought 1
smiles 1
and 1
joy 1
to 1
the 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
but 1
hardly 1
deceived 1
the 1
ever 1
watchful 1
and 1
nicer 1
eye 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
she 1
looked 1
forward 1
to 1
our 1
union 1
with 1
placid 1
contentment 1
not 1
unmingled 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
fear 1
which 1
past 1
misfortunes 1
had 1
impressed 1
that 1
what 1
now 1
appeared 1
certain 1
and 1
tangible 1
happiness 1
might 1
soon 1
dissipate 1
into 1
an 1
airy 1
dream 1
and 1
leave 1
no 1
trace 1
but 1
deep 1
and 1
everlasting 1
regret 1
preparations 1
were 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
event 1
congratulatory 1
visits 1
were 1
received 1
and 1
all 1
wore 1
a 1
smiling 1
appearance 1
i 1
shut 1
up 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
the 1
anxiety 1
that 1
preyed 1
there 1
and 1
entered 1
with 1
seeming 1
earnestness 1
into 1
the 1
plans 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
although 1
they 1
might 1
only 1
serve 1
as 1
the 1
decorations 1
of 1
my 1
tragedy 1
through 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
exertions 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
inheritance 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
had 1
been 1
restored 1
to 1
her 1
by 1
the 1
austrian 1
government 1
a 1
small 1
possession 1
on 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
como 1
belonged 1
to 1
her 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
that 1
immediately 1
after 1
our 1
union 1
we 1
should 1
proceed 1
to 1
villa 1
lavenza 1
and 1
spend 1
our 1
first 1
days 1
of 1
happiness 1
beside 1
the 1
beautiful 1
lake 1
near 1
which 1
it 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
i 1
took 1
every 1
precaution 1
to 1
defend 1
my 1
person 1
in 1
case 1
the 1
fiend 1
should 1
openly 1
attack 1
me 1
i 1
carried 1
pistols 1
and 1
a 1
dagger 1
constantly 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
was 1
ever 1
on 1
the 1
watch 1
to 1
prevent 1
artifice 1
and 1
by 1
these 1
means 1
gained 1
a 1
greater 1
degree 1
of 1
tranquillity 1
indeed 1
as 1
the 1
period 1
approached 1
the 1
threat 1
appeared 1
more 1
as 1
a 1
delusion 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
worthy 1
to 1
disturb 1
my 1
peace 1
while 1
the 1
happiness 1
i 1
hoped 1
for 1
in 1
my 1
marriage 1
wore 1
a 1
greater 1
appearance 1
of 1
certainty 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
fixed 1
for 1
its 1
solemnization 1
drew 1
nearer 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
it 1
continually 1
spoken 1
of 1
as 1
an 1
occurrence 1
which 1
no 1
accident 1
could 1
possibly 1
prevent 1
elizabeth 1
seemed 1
happy 1
my 1
tranquil 1
demeanour 1
contributed 1
greatly 1
to 1
calm 1
her 1
mind 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
that 1
was 1
to 1
fulfil 1
my 1
wishes 1
and 1
my 1
destiny 1
she 1
was 1
melancholy 1
and 1
a 1
presentiment 1
of 1
evil 1
pervaded 1
her 1
and 1
perhaps 1
also 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
dreadful 1
secret 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
reveal 1
to 1
her 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
my 1
father 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
overjoyed 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
bustle 1
of 1
preparation 1
only 1
recognized 1
in 1
the 1
melancholy 1
of 1
his 1
niece 1
the 1
diffidence 1
of 1
a 1
bride 1
after 1
the 1
ceremony 1
was 1
performed 1
a 1
large 1
party 1
assembled 1
at 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
agreed 1
that 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
commence 1
our 1
journey 1
by 1
water 1
sleeping 1
that 1
night 1
at 1
evian 1
and 1
continuing 1
our 1
voyage 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
fair 1
the 1
wind 1
favourable 1
all 1
smiled 1
on 1
our 1
nuptial 1
embarkation 1
those 1
were 1
the 1
last 1
moments 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
feeling 1
of 1
happiness 1
we 1
passed 1
rapidly 1
along 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
hot 1
but 1
we 1
were 1
sheltered 1
from 1
its 1
rays 1
by 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
canopy 1
while 1
we 1
enjoyed 1
the 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
sometimes 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
lake 1
where 1
we 1
saw 1
mont 1
saleve 1
the 1
pleasant 1
banks 1
of 1
montalegre 1
and 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
surmounting 1
all 1
the 1
beautiful 1
mont 1
blanc 1
and 1
the 1
assemblage 1
of 1
snowy 1
mountains 1
that 1
in 1
vain 1
endeavour 1
to 1
emulate 1
her 1
sometimes 1
coasting 1
the 1
opposite 1
banks 1
we 1
saw 1
the 1
mighty 1
jura 1
opposing 1
its 1
dark 1
side 1
to 1
the 1
ambition 1
that 1
would 1
quit 1
its 1
native 1
country 1
and 1
an 1
almost 1
insurmountable 1
barrier 1
to 1
the 1
invader 1
who 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
enslave 1
it 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
you 1
are 1
sorrowful 1
my 1
love 1
ah 1
if 1
you 1
knew 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
suffered 1
and 1
what 1
i 1
may 1
yet 1
endure 1
you 1
would 1
endeavour 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
taste 1
the 1
quiet 1
and 1
freedom 1
from 1
despair 1
that 1
this 1
one 1
day 1
at 1
least 1
permits 1
me 1
to 1
enjoy 1
be 1
happy 1
my 1
dear 1
victor 1
replied 1
elizabeth 1
there 1
is 1
i 1
hope 1
nothing 1
to 1
distress 1
you 1
and 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
if 1
a 1
lively 1
joy 1
is 1
not 1
painted 1
in 1
my 1
face 1
my 1
heart 1
is 1
contented 1
something 1
whispers 1
to 1
me 1
not 1
to 1
depend 1
too 1
much 1
on 1
the 1
prospect 1
that 1
is 1
opened 1
before 1
us 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
sinister 1
voice 1
observe 1
how 1
fast 1
we 1
move 1
along 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
clouds 1
which 1
sometimes 1
obscure 1
and 1
sometimes 1
rise 1
above 1
the 1
dome 1
of 1
mont 1
blanc 1
render 1
this 1
scene 1
of 1
beauty 1
still 1
more 1
interesting 1
look 1
also 1
at 1
the 1
innumerable 1
fish 1
that 1
are 1
swimming 1
in 1
the 1
clear 1
waters 1
where 1
we 1
can 1
distinguish 1
every 1
pebble 1
that 1
lies 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
what 1
a 1
divine 1
day 1
how 1
happy 1
and 1
serene 1
all 1
nature 1
appears 1
thus 1
elizabeth 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
divert 1
her 1
thoughts 1
and 1
mine 1
from 1
all 1
reflection 1
upon 1
melancholy 1
subjects 1
but 1
her 1
temper 1
was 1
fluctuating 1
joy 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
instants 1
shone 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
but 1
it 1
continually 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
distraction 1
and 1
reverie 1
the 1
sun 1
sank 1
lower 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
we 1
passed 1
the 1
river 1
drance 1
and 1
observed 1
its 1
path 1
through 1
the 1
chasms 1
of 1
the 1
higher 1
and 1
the 1
glens 1
of 1
the 1
lower 1
hills 1
the 1
alps 1
here 1
come 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
lake 1
and 1
we 1
approached 1
the 1
amphitheatre 1
of 1
mountains 1
which 1
forms 1
its 1
eastern 1
boundary 1
the 1
spire 1
of 1
evian 1
shone 1
under 1
the 1
woods 1
that 1
surrounded 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
range 1
of 1
mountain 1
above 1
mountain 1
by 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
overhung 1
the 1
wind 1
which 1
had 1
hitherto 1
carried 1
us 1
along 1
with 1
amazing 1
rapidity 1
sank 1
at 1
sunset 1
to 1
a 1
light 1
breeze 1
the 1
soft 1
air 1
just 1
ruffled 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
caused 1
a 1
pleasant 1
motion 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
as 1
we 1
approached 1
the 1
shore 1
from 1
which 1
it 1
wafted 1
the 1
most 1
delightful 1
scent 1
of 1
flowers 1
and 1
hay 1
the 1
sun 1
sank 1
beneath 1
the 1
horizon 1
as 1
we 1
landed 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
touched 1
the 1
shore 1
i 1
felt 1
those 1
cares 1
and 1
fears 1
revive 1
which 1
soon 1
were 1
to 1
clasp 1
me 1
and 1
cling 1
to 1
me 1
forever 1
chapter 1
23 1
it 1
was 1
eight 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
we 1
landed 1
we 1
walked 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
on 1
the 1
shore 1
enjoying 1
the 1
transitory 1
light 1
and 1
then 1
retired 1
to 1
the 1
inn 1
and 1
contemplated 1
the 1
lovely 1
scene 1
of 1
waters 1
woods 1
and 1
mountains 1
obscured 1
in 1
darkness 1
yet 1
still 1
displaying 1
their 1
black 1
outlines 1
the 1
wind 1
which 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
the 1
south 1
now 1
rose 1
with 1
great 1
violence 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
reached 1
her 1
summit 1
in 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
descend 1
the 1
clouds 1
swept 1
across 1
it 1
swifter 1
than 1
the 1
flight 1
of 1
the 1
vulture 1
and 1
dimmed 1
her 1
rays 1
while 1
the 1
lake 1
reflected 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
busy 1
heavens 1
rendered 1
still 1
busier 1
by 1
the 1
restless 1
waves 1
that 1
were 1
beginning 1
to 1
rise 1
suddenly 1
a 1
heavy 1
storm 1
of 1
rain 1
descended 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
calm 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
but 1
so 1
soon 1
as 1
night 1
obscured 1
the 1
shapes 1
of 1
objects 1
a 1
thousand 1
fears 1
arose 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
was 1
anxious 1
and 1
watchful 1
while 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
grasped 1
a 1
pistol 1
which 1
was 1
hidden 1
in 1
my 1
bosom 1
every 1
sound 1
terrified 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
resolved 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
sell 1
my 1
life 1
dearly 1
and 1
not 1
shrink 1
from 1
the 1
conflict 1
until 1
my 1
own 1
life 1
or 1
that 1
of 1
my 1
adversary 1

my 1
agitation 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
timid 1
and 1
fearful 1
silence 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
my 1
glance 1
which 1
communicated 1
terror 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
trembling 1
she 1
asked 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
agitates 1

oh 1
peace 1
peace 1
my 1
love 1
replied 1
i 1
this 1
night 1
and 1
all 1
will 1
be 1
safe 1
but 1
this 1
night 1
is 1
dreadful 1
very 1
dreadful 1
i 1
passed 1
an 1
hour 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
mind 1
when 1
suddenly 1
i 1
reflected 1
how 1
fearful 1
the 1
combat 1
which 1
i 1
momentarily 1
expected 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
i 1
earnestly 1
entreated 1
her 1
to 1
retire 1
resolving 1
not 1
to 1
join 1
her 1
until 1
i 1
had 1
obtained 1
some 1
knowledge 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
situation 1
of 1
my 1
enemy 1
she 1
left 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
continued 1
some 1
time 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
passages 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
inspecting 1
every 1
corner 1
that 1
might 1
afford 1
a 1
retreat 1
to 1
my 1
adversary 1
but 1
i 1
discovered 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
conjecture 1
that 1
some 1
fortunate 1
chance 1
had 1
intervened 1
to 1
prevent 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
his 1
menaces 1
when 1
suddenly 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
shrill 1
and 1
dreadful 1
scream 1
it 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
into 1
which 1
elizabeth 1
had 1
retired 1
as 1
i 1
heard 1
it 1
the 1
whole 1
truth 1
rushed 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
my 1
arms 1
dropped 1
the 1
motion 1
of 1
every 1
muscle 1
and 1
fibre 1
was 1
suspended 1
i 1
could 1
feel 1
the 1
blood 1
trickling 1
in 1
my 1
veins 1
and 1
tingling 1
in 1
the 1
extremities 1
of 1
my 1
limbs 1
this 1
state 1
lasted 1
but 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
scream 1
was 1
repeated 1
and 1
i 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
great 1
god 1
why 1
did 1
i 1
not 1
then 1
expire 1
why 1
am 1
i 1
here 1
to 1
relate 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
best 1
hope 1
and 1
the 1
purest 1
creature 1
on 1
earth 1
she 1
was 1
there 1
lifeless 1
and 1
inanimate 1
thrown 1
across 1
the 1
bed 1
her 1
head 1
hanging 1
down 1
and 1
her 1
pale 1
and 1
distorted 1
features 1
half 1
covered 1
by 1
her 1
hair 1
everywhere 1
i 1
turn 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
same 1
figure 1
her 1
bloodless 1
arms 1
and 1
relaxed 1
form 1
flung 1
by 1
the 1
murderer 1
on 1
its 1
bridal 1
bier 1
could 1
i 1
behold 1
this 1
and 1
live 1
alas 1
life 1
is 1
obstinate 1
and 1
clings 1
closest 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
most 1
hated 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
only 1
did 1
i 1
lose 1
recollection 1
i 1
fell 1
senseless 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
when 1
i 1
recovered 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
surrounded 1
by 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
the 1
inn 1
their 1
countenances 1
expressed 1
a 1
breathless 1
terror 1
but 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
others 1
appeared 1
only 1
as 1
a 1
mockery 1
a 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
feelings 1
that 1
oppressed 1
me 1
i 1
escaped 1
from 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
lay 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
elizabeth 1
my 1
love 1
my 1
wife 1
so 1
lately 1
living 1
so 1
dear 1
so 1
worthy 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
moved 1
from 1
the 1
posture 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
first 1
beheld 1
her 1
and 1
now 1
as 1
she 1
lay 1
her 1
head 1
upon 1
her 1
arm 1
and 1
a 1
handkerchief 1
thrown 1
across 1
her 1
face 1
and 1
neck 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
supposed 1
her 1
asleep 1
i 1
rushed 1
towards 1
her 1
and 1
embraced 1
her 1
with 1
ardour 1
but 1
the 1
deadly 1
languor 1
and 1
coldness 1
of 1
the 1
limbs 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
what 1
i 1
now 1
held 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
elizabeth 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
loved 1
and 1
cherished 1
the 1
murderous 1
mark 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
s 1
grasp 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
the 1
breath 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
issue 1
from 1
her 1
lips 1
while 1
i 1
still 1
hung 1
over 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
despair 1
i 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
up 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
had 1
before 1
been 1
darkened 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
panic 1
on 1
seeing 1
the 1
pale 1
yellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
illuminate 1
the 1
chamber 1
the 1
shutters 1
had 1
been 1
thrown 1
back 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
sensation 1
of 1
horror 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
described 1
i 1
saw 1
at 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
a 1
figure 1
the 1
most 1
hideous 1
and 1
abhorred 1
a 1
grin 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
jeer 1
as 1
with 1
his 1
fiendish 1
finger 1
he 1
pointed 1
towards 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
i 1
rushed 1
towards 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
drawing 1
a 1
pistol 1
from 1
my 1
bosom 1
fired 1
but 1
he 1
eluded 1
me 1
leaped 1
from 1
his 1
station 1
and 1
running 1
with 1
the 1
swiftness 1
of 1
lightning 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
lake 1
the 1
report 1
of 1
the 1
pistol 1
brought 1
a 1
crowd 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
i 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
disappeared 1
and 1
we 1
followed 1
the 1
track 1
with 1
boats 1
nets 1
were 1
cast 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
after 1
passing 1
several 1
hours 1
we 1
returned 1
hopeless 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
companions 1
believing 1
it 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
form 1
conjured 1
up 1
by 1
my 1
fancy 1
after 1
having 1
landed 1
they 1
proceeded 1
to 1
search 1
the 1
country 1
parties 1
going 1
in 1
different 1
directions 1
among 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
vines 1
i 1
attempted 1
to 1
accompany 1
them 1
and 1
proceeded 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
my 1
head 1
whirled 1
round 1
my 1
steps 1
were 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
a 1
drunken 1
man 1
i 1
fell 1
at 1
last 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
utter 1
exhaustion 1
a 1
film 1
covered 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
my 1
skin 1
was 1
parched 1
with 1
the 1
heat 1
of 1
fever 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
i 1
was 1
carried 1
back 1
and 1
placed 1
on 1
a 1
bed 1
hardly 1
conscious 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
my 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
seek 1
something 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
lost 1
after 1
an 1
interval 1
i 1
arose 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
by 1
instinct 1
crawled 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
where 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
my 1
beloved 1
lay 1
there 1
were 1
women 1
weeping 1
around 1
i 1
hung 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
joined 1
my 1
sad 1
tears 1
to 1
theirs 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
no 1
distinct 1
idea 1
presented 1
itself 1
to 1
my 1
mind 1
but 1
my 1
thoughts 1
rambled 1
to 1
various 1
subjects 1
reflecting 1
confusedly 1
on 1
my 1
misfortunes 1
and 1
their 1
cause 1
i 1
was 1
bewildered 1
in 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
horror 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
william 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
justine 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
clerval 1
and 1
lastly 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
even 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
knew 1
not 1
that 1
my 1
only 1
remaining 1
friends 1
were 1
safe 1
from 1
the 1
malignity 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
my 1
father 1
even 1
now 1
might 1
be 1
writhing 1
under 1
his 1
grasp 1
and 1
ernest 1
might 1
be 1
dead 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
this 1
idea 1
made 1
me 1
shudder 1
and 1
recalled 1
me 1
to 1
action 1
i 1
started 1
up 1
and 1
resolved 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
geneva 1
with 1
all 1
possible 1
speed 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
horses 1
to 1
be 1
procured 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
return 1
by 1
the 1
lake 1
but 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
unfavourable 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
fell 1
in 1
torrents 1
however 1
it 1
was 1
hardly 1
morning 1
and 1
i 1
might 1
reasonably 1
hope 1
to 1
arrive 1
by 1
night 1
i 1
hired 1
men 1
to 1
row 1
and 1
took 1
an 1
oar 1
myself 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
always 1
experienced 1
relief 1
from 1
mental 1
torment 1
in 1
bodily 1
exercise 1
but 1
the 1
overflowing 1
misery 1
i 1
now 1
felt 1
and 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
agitation 1
that 1
i 1
endured 1
rendered 1
me 1
incapable 1
of 1
any 1
exertion 1
i 1
threw 1
down 1
the 1
oar 1
and 1
leaning 1
my 1
head 1
upon 1
my 1
hands 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
every 1
gloomy 1
idea 1
that 1
arose 1
if 1
i 1
looked 1
up 1
i 1
saw 1
scenes 1
which 1
were 1
familiar 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
happier 1
time 1
and 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
contemplated 1
but 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
her 1
who 1
was 1
now 1
but 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
a 1
recollection 1
tears 1
streamed 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
rain 1
had 1
ceased 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
fish 1
play 1
in 1
the 1
waters 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
done 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
before 1
they 1
had 1
then 1
been 1
observed 1
by 1
elizabeth 1
nothing 1
is 1
so 1
painful 1
to 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
as 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
sudden 1
change 1
the 1
sun 1
might 1
shine 1
or 1
the 1
clouds 1
might 1
lower 1
but 1
nothing 1
could 1
appear 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
a 1
fiend 1
had 1
snatched 1
from 1
me 1
every 1
hope 1
of 1
future 1
happiness 1
no 1
creature 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
so 1
miserable 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
frightful 1
an 1
event 1
is 1
single 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
man 1
but 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
dwell 1
upon 1
the 1
incidents 1
that 1
followed 1
this 1
last 1
overwhelming 1
event 1
mine 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
horrors 1
i 1
have 1
reached 1
their 1
acme 1
and 1
what 1
i 1
must 1
now 1
relate 1
can 1
but 1
be 1
tedious 1
to 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
my 1
friends 1
were 1
snatched 1
away 1
i 1
was 1
left 1
desolate 1
my 1
own 1
strength 1
is 1
exhausted 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
tell 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
what 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
hideous 1
narration 1
i 1
arrived 1
at 1
geneva 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
ernest 1
yet 1
lived 1
but 1
the 1
former 1
sunk 1
under 1
the 1
tidings 1
that 1
i 1
bore 1
i 1
see 1
him 1
now 1
excellent 1
and 1
venerable 1
old 1
man 1
his 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
in 1
vacancy 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
lost 1
their 1
charm 1
and 1
their 1
delight 1
his 1
elizabeth 1
his 1
more 1
than 1
daughter 1
whom 1
he 1
doted 1
on 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
affection 1
which 1
a 1
man 1
feels 1
who 1
in 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
life 1
having 1
few 1
affections 1
clings 1
more 1
earnestly 1
to 1
those 1
that 1
remain 1
cursed 1
cursed 1
be 1
the 1
fiend 1
that 1
brought 1
misery 1
on 1
his 1
grey 1
hairs 1
and 1
doomed 1
him 1
to 1
waste 1
in 1
wretchedness 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
under 1
the 1
horrors 1
that 1
were 1
accumulated 1
around 1
him 1
the 1
springs 1
of 1
existence 1
suddenly 1
gave 1
way 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
rise 1
from 1
his 1
bed 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
he 1
died 1
in 1
my 1
arms 1
what 1
then 1
became 1
of 1
me 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
i 1
lost 1
sensation 1
and 1
chains 1
and 1
darkness 1
were 1
the 1
only 1
objects 1
that 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
sometimes 1
indeed 1
i 1
dreamt 1
that 1
i 1
wandered 1
in 1
flowery 1
meadows 1
and 1
pleasant 1
vales 1
with 1
the 1
friends 1
of 1
my 1
youth 1
but 1
i 1
awoke 1
and 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
a 1
dungeon 1
melancholy 1
followed 1
but 1
by 1
degrees 1
i 1
gained 1
a 1
clear 1
conception 1
of 1
my 1
miseries 1
and 1
situation 1
and 1
was 1
then 1
released 1
from 1
my 1
prison 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
called 1
me 1
mad 1
and 1
during 1
many 1
months 1
as 1
i 1
understood 1
a 1
solitary 1
cell 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
habitation 1
liberty 1
however 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
useless 1
gift 1
to 1
me 1
had 1
i 1
not 1
as 1
i 1
awakened 1
to 1
reason 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
awakened 1
to 1
revenge 1
as 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
past 1
misfortunes 1
pressed 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
their 1
cause 1
the 1
monster 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
created 1
the 1
miserable 1
daemon 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
sent 1
abroad 1
into 1
the 1
world 1
for 1
my 1
destruction 1
i 1
was 1
possessed 1
by 1
a 1
maddening 1
rage 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
desired 1
and 1
ardently 1
prayed 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
him 1
within 1
my 1
grasp 1
to 1
wreak 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
signal 1
revenge 1
on 1
his 1
cursed 1
head 1
nor 1
did 1
my 1
hate 1
long 1
confine 1
itself 1
to 1
useless 1
wishes 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
reflect 1
on 1
the 1
best 1
means 1
of 1
securing 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
about 1
a 1
month 1
after 1
my 1
release 1
i 1
repaired 1
to 1
a 1
criminal 1
judge 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
accusation 1
to 1
make 1
that 1
i 1
knew 1
the 1
destroyer 1
of 1
my 1
family 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
required 1
him 1
to 1
exert 1
his 1
whole 1
authority 1
for 1
the 1
apprehension 1
of 1
the 1
murderer 1
the 1
magistrate 1
listened 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
attention 1
and 1
kindness 1
be 1
assured 1
sir 1
said 1
he 1
no 1
pains 1
or 1
exertions 1
on 1
my 1
part 1
shall 1
be 1
spared 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
villain 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
replied 1
i 1
listen 1
therefore 1
to 1
the 1
deposition 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
is 1
indeed 1
a 1
tale 1
so 1
strange 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
fear 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
credit 1
it 1
were 1
there 1
not 1
something 1
in 1
truth 1
which 1
however 1
wonderful 1
forces 1
conviction 1
the 1
story 1
is 1
too 1
connected 1
to 1
be 1
mistaken 1
for 1
a 1
dream 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
motive 1
for 1
falsehood 1
my 1
manner 1
as 1
i 1
thus 1
addressed 1
him 1
was 1
impressive 1
but 1
calm 1
i 1
had 1
formed 1
in 1
my 1
own 1
heart 1
a 1
resolution 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
destroyer 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
this 1
purpose 1
quieted 1
my 1
agony 1
and 1
for 1
an 1
interval 1
reconciled 1
me 1
to 1
life 1
i 1
now 1
related 1
my 1
history 1
briefly 1
but 1
with 1
firmness 1
and 1
precision 1
marking 1
the 1
dates 1
with 1
accuracy 1
and 1
never 1
deviating 1
into 1
invective 1
or 1
exclamation 1
the 1
magistrate 1
appeared 1
at 1
first 1
perfectly 1
incredulous 1
but 1
as 1
i 1
continued 1
he 1
became 1
more 1
attentive 1
and 1
interested 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
sometimes 1
shudder 1
with 1
horror 1
at 1
others 1
a 1
lively 1
surprise 1
unmingled 1
with 1
disbelief 1
was 1
painted 1
on 1
his 1
countenance 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
concluded 1
my 1
narration 1
i 1
said 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
being 1
whom 1
i 1
accuse 1
and 1
for 1
whose 1
seizure 1
and 1
punishment 1
i 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
to 1
exert 1
your 1
whole 1
power 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
duty 1
as 1
a 1
magistrate 1
and 1
i 1
believe 1
and 1
hope 1
that 1
your 1
feelings 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
will 1
not 1
revolt 1
from 1
the 1
execution 1
of 1
those 1
functions 1
on 1
this 1
occasion 1
this 1
address 1
caused 1
a 1
considerable 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
physiognomy 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
auditor 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
my 1
story 1
with 1
that 1
half 1
kind 1
of 1
belief 1
that 1
is 1
given 1
to 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
spirits 1
and 1
supernatural 1
events 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
act 1
officially 1
in 1
consequence 1
the 1
whole 1
tide 1
of 1
his 1
incredulity 1
returned 1
he 1
however 1
answered 1
mildly 1
i 1
would 1
willingly 1
afford 1
you 1
every 1
aid 1
in 1
your 1
pursuit 1
but 1
the 1
creature 1
of 1
whom 1
you 1
speak 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
powers 1
which 1
would 1
put 1
all 1
my 1
exertions 1
to 1
defiance 1
who 1
can 1
follow 1
an 1
animal 1
which 1
can 1
traverse 1
the 1
sea 1
of 1
ice 1
and 1
inhabit 1
caves 1
and 1
dens 1
where 1
no 1
man 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
intrude 1
besides 1
some 1
months 1
have 1
elapsed 1
since 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
his 1
crimes 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
conjecture 1
to 1
what 1
place 1
he 1
has 1
wandered 1
or 1
what 1
region 1
he 1
may 1
now 1
inhabit 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
he 1
hovers 1
near 1
the 1
spot 1
which 1
i 1
inhabit 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
has 1
indeed 1
taken 1
refuge 1
in 1
the 1
alps 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
hunted 1
like 1
the 1
chamois 1
and 1
destroyed 1
as 1
a 1
beast 1
of 1
prey 1
but 1
i 1
perceive 1
your 1
thoughts 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
credit 1
my 1
narrative 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
intend 1
to 1
pursue 1
my 1
enemy 1
with 1
the 1
punishment 1
which 1
is 1
his 1
desert 1
as 1
i 1
spoke 1
rage 1
sparkled 1
in 1
my 1
eyes 1
the 1
magistrate 1
was 1
intimidated 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
will 1
exert 1
myself 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
to 1
seize 1
the 1
monster 1
be 1
assured 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
suffer 1
punishment 1
proportionate 1
to 1
his 1
crimes 1
but 1
i 1
fear 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
yourself 1
described 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
properties 1
that 1
this 1
will 1
prove 1
impracticable 1
and 1
thus 1
while 1
every 1
proper 1
measure 1
is 1
pursued 1
you 1
should 1
make 1
up 1
your 1
mind 1
to 1
disappointment 1
that 1
cannot 1
be 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
say 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
little 1
avail 1
my 1
revenge 1
is 1
of 1
no 1
moment 1
to 1
you 1
yet 1
while 1
i 1
allow 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
vice 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
devouring 1
and 1
only 1
passion 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
my 1
rage 1
is 1
unspeakable 1
when 1
i 1
reflect 1
that 1
the 1
murderer 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
turned 1
loose 1
upon 1
society 1
still 1
exists 1
you 1
refuse 1
my 1
just 1
demand 1
i 1
have 1
but 1
one 1
resource 1
and 1
i 1
devote 1
myself 1
either 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
to 1
his 1
destruction 1
i 1
trembled 1
with 1
excess 1
of 1
agitation 1
as 1
i 1
said 1
this 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
frenzy 1
in 1
my 1
manner 1
and 1
something 1
i 1
doubt 1
not 1
of 1
that 1
haughty 1
fierceness 1
which 1
the 1
martyrs 1
of 1
old 1
are 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
possessed 1
but 1
to 1
a 1
genevan 1
magistrate 1
whose 1
mind 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
far 1
other 1
ideas 1
than 1
those 1
of 1
devotion 1
and 1
heroism 1
this 1
elevation 1
of 1
mind 1
had 1
much 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
madness 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
soothe 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
nurse 1
does 1
a 1
child 1
and 1
reverted 1
to 1
my 1
tale 1
as 1
the 1
effects 1
of 1
delirium 1
man 1
i 1
cried 1
how 1
ignorant 1
art 1
thou 1
in 1
thy 1
pride 1
of 1
wisdom 1
cease 1
you 1
know 1
not 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
you 1
say 1
i 1
broke 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
angry 1
and 1
disturbed 1
and 1
retired 1
to 1
meditate 1
on 1
some 1
other 1
mode 1
of 1
action 1
chapter 1
24 1
my 1
present 1
situation 1
was 1
one 1
in 1
which 1
all 1
voluntary 1
thought 1
was 1
swallowed 1
up 1
and 1
lost 1
i 1
was 1
hurried 1
away 1
by 1
fury 1
revenge 1
alone 1
endowed 1
me 1
with 1
strength 1
and 1
composure 1
it 1
moulded 1
my 1
feelings 1
and 1
allowed 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
calculating 1
and 1
calm 1
at 1
periods 1
when 1
otherwise 1
delirium 1
or 1
death 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
my 1
portion 1
my 1
first 1
resolution 1
was 1
to 1
quit 1
geneva 1
forever 1
my 1
country 1
which 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
happy 1
and 1
beloved 1
was 1
dear 1
to 1
me 1
now 1
in 1
my 1
adversity 1
became 1
hateful 1
i 1
provided 1
myself 1
with 1
a 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
jewels 1
which 1
had 1
belonged 1
to 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
departed 1
and 1
now 1
my 1
wanderings 1
began 1
which 1
are 1
to 1
cease 1
but 1
with 1
life 1
i 1
have 1
traversed 1
a 1
vast 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
have 1
endured 1
all 1
the 1
hardships 1
which 1
travellers 1
in 1
deserts 1
and 1
barbarous 1
countries 1
are 1
wont 1
to 1
meet 1
how 1
i 1
have 1
lived 1
i 1
hardly 1
know 1
many 1
times 1
have 1
i 1
stretched 1
my 1
failing 1
limbs 1
upon 1
the 1
sandy 1
plain 1
and 1
prayed 1
for 1
death 1
but 1
revenge 1
kept 1
me 1
alive 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
die 1
and 1
leave 1
my 1
adversary 1
in 1
being 1
when 1
i 1
quitted 1
geneva 1
my 1
first 1
labour 1
was 1
to 1
gain 1
some 1
clue 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
might 1
trace 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
my 1
fiendish 1
enemy 1
but 1
my 1
plan 1
was 1
unsettled 1
and 1
i 1
wandered 1
many 1
hours 1
round 1
the 1
confines 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
uncertain 1
what 1
path 1
i 1
should 1
pursue 1
as 1
night 1
approached 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
of 1
the 1
cemetery 1
where 1
william 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
my 1
father 1
reposed 1
i 1
entered 1
it 1
and 1
approached 1
the 1
tomb 1
which 1
marked 1
their 1
graves 1
everything 1
was 1
silent 1
except 1
the 1
leaves 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
which 1
were 1
gently 1
agitated 1
by 1
the 1
wind 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
nearly 1
dark 1
and 1
the 1
scene 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
solemn 1
and 1
affecting 1
even 1
to 1
an 1
uninterested 1
observer 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
departed 1
seemed 1
to 1
flit 1
around 1
and 1
to 1
cast 1
a 1
shadow 1
which 1
was 1
felt 1
but 1
not 1
seen 1
around 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
mourner 1
the 1
deep 1
grief 1
which 1
this 1
scene 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
excited 1
quickly 1
gave 1
way 1
to 1
rage 1
and 1
despair 1
they 1
were 1
dead 1
and 1
i 1
lived 1
their 1
murderer 1
also 1
lived 1
and 1
to 1
destroy 1
him 1
i 1
must 1
drag 1
out 1
my 1
weary 1
existence 1
i 1
knelt 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
kissed 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
with 1
quivering 1
lips 1
exclaimed 1
by 1
the 1
sacred 1
earth 1
on 1
which 1
i 1
kneel 1
by 1
the 1
shades 1
that 1
wander 1
near 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
eternal 1
grief 1
that 1
i 1
feel 1
i 1
swear 1
and 1
by 1
thee 1
o 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
spirits 1
that 1
preside 1
over 1
thee 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
daemon 1
who 1
caused 1
this 1
misery 1
until 1
he 1
or 1
i 1
shall 1
perish 1
in 1
mortal 1
conflict 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
i 1
will 1
preserve 1
my 1
life 1
to 1
execute 1
this 1
dear 1
revenge 1
will 1
i 1
again 1
behold 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
tread 1
the 1
green 1
herbage 1
of 1
earth 1
which 1
otherwise 1
should 1
vanish 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
forever 1
and 1
i 1
call 1
on 1
you 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
and 1
on 1
you 1
wandering 1
ministers 1
of 1
vengeance 1
to 1
aid 1
and 1
conduct 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
work 1
let 1
the 1
cursed 1
and 1
hellish 1
monster 1
drink 1
deep 1
of 1
agony 1
let 1
him 1
feel 1
the 1
despair 1
that 1
now 1
torments 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
begun 1
my 1
adjuration 1
with 1
solemnity 1
and 1
an 1
awe 1
which 1
almost 1
assured 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
shades 1
of 1
my 1
murdered 1
friends 1
heard 1
and 1
approved 1
my 1
devotion 1
but 1
the 1
furies 1
possessed 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
concluded 1
and 1
rage 1
choked 1
my 1
utterance 1
i 1
was 1
answered 1
through 1
the 1
stillness 1
of 1
night 1
by 1
a 1
loud 1
and 1
fiendish 1
laugh 1
it 1
rang 1
on 1
my 1
ears 1
long 1
and 1
heavily 1
the 1
mountains 1
re 1
echoed 1
it 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
all 1
hell 1
surrounded 1
me 1
with 1
mockery 1
and 1
laughter 1
surely 1
in 1
that 1
moment 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
possessed 1
by 1
frenzy 1
and 1
have 1
destroyed 1
my 1
miserable 1
existence 1
but 1
that 1
my 1
vow 1
was 1
heard 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
reserved 1
for 1
vengeance 1
the 1
laughter 1
died 1
away 1
when 1
a 1
well 1
known 1
and 1
abhorred 1
voice 1
apparently 1
close 1
to 1
my 1
ear 1
addressed 1
me 1
in 1
an 1
audible 1
whisper 1
i 1
am 1
satisfied 1
miserable 1
wretch 1
you 1
have 1
determined 1
to 1
live 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
satisfied 1
i 1
darted 1
towards 1
the 1
spot 1
from 1
which 1
the 1
sound 1
proceeded 1
but 1
the 1
devil 1
eluded 1
my 1
grasp 1
suddenly 1
the 1
broad 1
disk 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
arose 1
and 1
shone 1
full 1
upon 1
his 1
ghastly 1
and 1
distorted 1
shape 1
as 1
he 1
fled 1
with 1
more 1
than 1
mortal 1
speed 1
i 1
pursued 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
many 1
months 1
this 1
has 1
been 1
my 1
task 1
guided 1
by 1
a 1
slight 1
clue 1
i 1
followed 1
the 1
windings 1
of 1
the 1
rhone 1
but 1
vainly 1
the 1
blue 1
mediterranean 1
appeared 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
strange 1
chance 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
fiend 1
enter 1
by 1
night 1
and 1
hide 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
vessel 1
bound 1
for 1
the 1
black 1
sea 1
i 1
took 1
my 1
passage 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
ship 1
but 1
he 1
escaped 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
how 1
amidst 1
the 1
wilds 1
of 1
tartary 1
and 1
russia 1
although 1
he 1
still 1
evaded 1
me 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
followed 1
in 1
his 1
track 1
sometimes 1
the 1
peasants 1
scared 1
by 1
this 1
horrid 1
apparition 1
informed 1
me 1
of 1
his 1
path 1
sometimes 1
he 1
himself 1
who 1
feared 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
lost 1
all 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
i 1
should 1
despair 1
and 1
die 1
left 1
some 1
mark 1
to 1
guide 1
me 1
the 1
snows 1
descended 1
on 1
my 1
head 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
print 1
of 1
his 1
huge 1
step 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
plain 1
to 1
you 1
first 1
entering 1
on 1
life 1
to 1
whom 1
care 1
is 1
new 1
and 1
agony 1
unknown 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
understand 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
felt 1
and 1
still 1
feel 1
cold 1
want 1
and 1
fatigue 1
were 1
the 1
least 1
pains 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
endure 1
i 1
was 1
cursed 1
by 1
some 1
devil 1
and 1
carried 1
about 1
with 1
me 1
my 1
eternal 1
hell 1
yet 1
still 1
a 1
spirit 1
of 1
good 1
followed 1
and 1
directed 1
my 1
steps 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
most 1
murmured 1
would 1
suddenly 1
extricate 1
me 1
from 1
seemingly 1
insurmountable 1
difficulties 1
sometimes 1
when 1
nature 1
overcome 1
by 1
hunger 1
sank 1
under 1
the 1
exhaustion 1
a 1
repast 1
was 1
prepared 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
desert 1
that 1
restored 1
and 1
inspirited 1
me 1
the 1
fare 1
was 1
indeed 1
coarse 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
peasants 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
ate 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
set 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
spirits 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
invoked 1
to 1
aid 1
me 1
often 1
when 1
all 1
was 1
dry 1
the 1
heavens 1
cloudless 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
parched 1
by 1
thirst 1
a 1
slight 1
cloud 1
would 1
bedim 1
the 1
sky 1
shed 1
the 1
few 1
drops 1
that 1
revived 1
me 1
and 1
vanish 1
i 1
followed 1
when 1
i 1
could 1
the 1
courses 1
of 1
the 1
rivers 1
but 1
the 1
daemon 1
generally 1
avoided 1
these 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
that 1
the 1
population 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
chiefly 1
collected 1
in 1
other 1
places 1
human 1
beings 1
were 1
seldom 1
seen 1
and 1
i 1
generally 1
subsisted 1
on 1
the 1
wild 1
animals 1
that 1
crossed 1
my 1
path 1
i 1
had 1
money 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
gained 1
the 1
friendship 1
of 1
the 1
villagers 1
by 1
distributing 1
it 1
or 1
i 1
brought 1
with 1
me 1
some 1
food 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
killed 1
which 1
after 1
taking 1
a 1
small 1
part 1
i 1
always 1
presented 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
provided 1
me 1
with 1
fire 1
and 1
utensils 1
for 1
cooking 1
my 1
life 1
as 1
it 1
passed 1
thus 1
was 1
indeed 1
hateful 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
sleep 1
alone 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
taste 1
joy 1
o 1
blessed 1
sleep 1
often 1
when 1
most 1
miserable 1
i 1
sank 1
to 1
repose 1
and 1
my 1
dreams 1
lulled 1
me 1
even 1
to 1
rapture 1
the 1
spirits 1
that 1
guarded 1
me 1
had 1
provided 1
these 1
moments 1
or 1
rather 1
hours 1
of 1
happiness 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
retain 1
strength 1
to 1
fulfil 1
my 1
pilgrimage 1
deprived 1
of 1
this 1
respite 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
sunk 1
under 1
my 1
hardships 1
during 1
the 1
day 1
i 1
was 1
sustained 1
and 1
inspirited 1
by 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
night 1
for 1
in 1
sleep 1
i 1
saw 1
my 1
friends 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
my 1
beloved 1
country 1
again 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
benevolent 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
father 1
heard 1
the 1
silver 1
tones 1
of 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
s 1
voice 1
and 1
beheld 1
clerval 1
enjoying 1
health 1
and 1
youth 1
often 1
when 1
wearied 1
by 1
a 1
toilsome 1
march 1
i 1
persuaded 1
myself 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
dreaming 1
until 1
night 1
should 1
come 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
then 1
enjoy 1
reality 1
in 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
my 1
dearest 1
friends 1
what 1
agonizing 1
fondness 1
did 1
i 1
feel 1
for 1
them 1
how 1
did 1
i 1
cling 1
to 1
their 1
dear 1
forms 1
as 1
sometimes 1
they 1
haunted 1
even 1
my 1
waking 1
hours 1
and 1
persuade 1
myself 1
that 1
they 1
still 1
lived 1
at 1
such 1
moments 1
vengeance 1
that 1
burned 1
within 1
me 1
died 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
i 1
pursued 1
my 1
path 1
towards 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
more 1
as 1
a 1
task 1
enjoined 1
by 1
heaven 1
as 1
the 1
mechanical 1
impulse 1
of 1
some 1
power 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
unconscious 1
than 1
as 1
the 1
ardent 1
desire 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
what 1
his 1
feelings 1
were 1
whom 1
i 1
pursued 1
i 1
cannot 1
know 1
sometimes 1
indeed 1
he 1
left 1
marks 1
in 1
writing 1
on 1
the 1
barks 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
or 1
cut 1
in 1
stone 1
that 1
guided 1
me 1
and 1
instigated 1
my 1
fury 1
my 1
reign 1
is 1
not 1
yet 1
over 1
these 1
words 1
were 1
legible 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
inscriptions 1
you 1
live 1
and 1
my 1
power 1
is 1
complete 1
follow 1
me 1
i 1
seek 1
the 1
everlasting 1
ices 1
of 1
the 1
north 1
where 1
you 1
will 1
feel 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
cold 1
and 1
frost 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
impassive 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
near 1
this 1
place 1
if 1
you 1
follow 1
not 1
too 1
tardily 1
a 1
dead 1
hare 1
eat 1
and 1
be 1
refreshed 1
come 1
on 1
my 1
enemy 1
we 1
have 1
yet 1
to 1
wrestle 1
for 1
our 1
lives 1
but 1
many 1
hard 1
and 1
miserable 1
hours 1
must 1
you 1
endure 1
until 1
that 1
period 1
shall 1
arrive 1
scoffing 1
devil 1
again 1
do 1
i 1
vow 1
vengeance 1
again 1
do 1
i 1
devote 1
thee 1
miserable 1
fiend 1
to 1
torture 1
and 1
death 1
never 1
will 1
i 1
give 1
up 1
my 1
search 1
until 1
he 1
or 1
i 1
perish 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
what 1
ecstasy 1
shall 1
i 1
join 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
my 1
departed 1
friends 1
who 1
even 1
now 1
prepare 1
for 1
me 1
the 1
reward 1
of 1
my 1
tedious 1
toil 1
and 1
horrible 1
pilgrimage 1
as 1
i 1
still 1
pursued 1
my 1
journey 1
to 1
the 1
northward 1
the 1
snows 1
thickened 1
and 1
the 1
cold 1
increased 1
in 1
a 1
degree 1
almost 1
too 1
severe 1
to 1
support 1
the 1
peasants 1
were 1
shut 1
up 1
in 1
their 1
hovels 1
and 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
hardy 1
ventured 1
forth 1
to 1
seize 1
the 1
animals 1
whom 1
starvation 1
had 1
forced 1
from 1
their 1
hiding 1
places 1
to 1
seek 1
for 1
prey 1
the 1
rivers 1
were 1
covered 1
with 1
ice 1
and 1
no 1
fish 1
could 1
be 1
procured 1
and 1
thus 1
i 1
was 1
cut 1
off 1
from 1
my 1
chief 1
article 1
of 1
maintenance 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
my 1
enemy 1
increased 1
with 1
the 1
difficulty 1
of 1
my 1
labours 1
one 1
inscription 1
that 1
he 1
left 1
was 1
in 1
these 1
words 1
prepare 1
your 1
toils 1
only 1
begin 1
wrap 1
yourself 1
in 1
furs 1
and 1
provide 1
food 1
for 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
enter 1
upon 1
a 1
journey 1
where 1
your 1
sufferings 1
will 1
satisfy 1
my 1
everlasting 1
hatred 1
my 1
courage 1
and 1
perseverance 1
were 1
invigorated 1
by 1
these 1
scoffing 1
words 1
i 1
resolved 1
not 1
to 1
fail 1
in 1
my 1
purpose 1
and 1
calling 1
on 1
heaven 1
to 1
support 1
me 1
i 1
continued 1
with 1
unabated 1
fervour 1
to 1
traverse 1
immense 1
deserts 1
until 1
the 1
ocean 1
appeared 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
formed 1
the 1
utmost 1
boundary 1
of 1
the 1
horizon 1
oh 1
how 1
unlike 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
blue 1
seasons 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
covered 1
with 1
ice 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
distinguished 1
from 1
land 1
by 1
its 1
superior 1
wildness 1
and 1
ruggedness 1
the 1
greeks 1
wept 1
for 1
joy 1
when 1
they 1
beheld 1
the 1
mediterranean 1
from 1
the 1
hills 1
of 1
asia 1
and 1
hailed 1
with 1
rapture 1
the 1
boundary 1
of 1
their 1
toils 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
weep 1
but 1
i 1
knelt 1
down 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
full 1
heart 1
thanked 1
my 1
guiding 1
spirit 1
for 1
conducting 1
me 1
in 1
safety 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
i 1
hoped 1
notwithstanding 1
my 1
adversary 1
s 1
gibe 1
to 1
meet 1
and 1
grapple 1
with 1
him 1
some 1
weeks 1
before 1
this 1
period 1
i 1
had 1
procured 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
dogs 1
and 1
thus 1
traversed 1
the 1
snows 1
with 1
inconceivable 1
speed 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
whether 1
the 1
fiend 1
possessed 1
the 1
same 1
advantages 1
but 1
i 1
found 1
that 1
as 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
daily 1
lost 1
ground 1
in 1
the 1
pursuit 1
i 1
now 1
gained 1
on 1
him 1
so 1
much 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
saw 1
the 1
ocean 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
day 1
s 1
journey 1
in 1
advance 1
and 1
i 1
hoped 1
to 1
intercept 1
him 1
before 1
he 1
should 1
reach 1
the 1
beach 1
with 1
new 1
courage 1
therefore 1
i 1
pressed 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
two 1
days 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
wretched 1
hamlet 1
on 1
the 1
seashore 1
i 1
inquired 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
concerning 1
the 1
fiend 1
and 1
gained 1
accurate 1
information 1
a 1
gigantic 1
monster 1
they 1
said 1
had 1
arrived 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
armed 1
with 1
a 1
gun 1
and 1
many 1
pistols 1
putting 1
to 1
flight 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
of 1
a 1
solitary 1
cottage 1
through 1
fear 1
of 1
his 1
terrific 1
appearance 1
he 1
had 1
carried 1
off 1
their 1
store 1
of 1
winter 1
food 1
and 1
placing 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
sledge 1
to 1
draw 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
seized 1
on 1
a 1
numerous 1
drove 1
of 1
trained 1
dogs 1
he 1
had 1
harnessed 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
night 1
to 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
the 1
horror 1
struck 1
villagers 1
had 1
pursued 1
his 1
journey 1
across 1
the 1
sea 1
in 1
a 1
direction 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
no 1
land 1
and 1
they 1
conjectured 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
speedily 1
be 1
destroyed 1
by 1
the 1
breaking 1
of 1
the 1
ice 1
or 1
frozen 1
by 1
the 1
eternal 1
frosts 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
information 1
i 1
suffered 1
a 1
temporary 1
access 1
of 1
despair 1
he 1
had 1
escaped 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
commence 1
a 1
destructive 1
and 1
almost 1
endless 1
journey 1
across 1
the 1
mountainous 1
ices 1
of 1
the 1
ocean 1
amidst 1
cold 1
that 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
could 1
long 1
endure 1
and 1
which 1
i 1
the 1
native 1
of 1
a 1
genial 1
and 1
sunny 1
climate 1
could 1
not 1
hope 1
to 1
survive 1
yet 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
the 1
fiend 1
should 1
live 1
and 1
be 1
triumphant 1
my 1
rage 1
and 1
vengeance 1
returned 1
and 1
like 1
a 1
mighty 1
tide 1
overwhelmed 1
every 1
other 1
feeling 1
after 1
a 1
slight 1
repose 1
during 1
which 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
hovered 1
round 1
and 1
instigated 1
me 1
to 1
toil 1
and 1
revenge 1
i 1
prepared 1
for 1
my 1
journey 1
i 1
exchanged 1
my 1
land 1
sledge 1
for 1
one 1
fashioned 1
for 1
the 1
inequalities 1
of 1
the 1
frozen 1
ocean 1
and 1
purchasing 1
a 1
plentiful 1
stock 1
of 1
provisions 1
i 1
departed 1
from 1
land 1
i 1
cannot 1
guess 1
how 1
many 1
days 1
have 1
passed 1
since 1
then 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
endured 1
misery 1
which 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
eternal 1
sentiment 1
of 1
a 1
just 1
retribution 1
burning 1
within 1
my 1
heart 1
could 1
have 1
enabled 1
me 1
to 1
support 1
immense 1
and 1
rugged 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
often 1
barred 1
up 1
my 1
passage 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
heard 1
the 1
thunder 1
of 1
the 1
ground 1
sea 1
which 1
threatened 1
my 1
destruction 1
but 1
again 1
the 1
frost 1
came 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
paths 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
secure 1
by 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
provision 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
consumed 1
i 1
should 1
guess 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
passed 1
three 1
weeks 1
in 1
this 1
journey 1
and 1
the 1
continual 1
protraction 1
of 1
hope 1
returning 1
back 1
upon 1
the 1
heart 1
often 1
wrung 1
bitter 1
drops 1
of 1
despondency 1
and 1
grief 1
from 1
my 1
eyes 1
despair 1
had 1
indeed 1
almost 1
secured 1
her 1
prey 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
have 1
sunk 1
beneath 1
this 1
misery 1
once 1
after 1
the 1
poor 1
animals 1
that 1
conveyed 1
me 1
had 1
with 1
incredible 1
toil 1
gained 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
a 1
sloping 1
ice 1
mountain 1
and 1
one 1
sinking 1
under 1
his 1
fatigue 1
died 1
i 1
viewed 1
the 1
expanse 1
before 1
me 1
with 1
anguish 1
when 1
suddenly 1
my 1
eye 1
caught 1
a 1
dark 1
speck 1
upon 1
the 1
dusky 1
plain 1
i 1
strained 1
my 1
sight 1
to 1
discover 1
what 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
and 1
uttered 1
a 1
wild 1
cry 1
of 1
ecstasy 1
when 1
i 1
distinguished 1
a 1
sledge 1
and 1
the 1
distorted 1
proportions 1
of 1
a 1
well 1
known 1
form 1
within 1
oh 1
with 1
what 1
a 1
burning 1
gush 1
did 1
hope 1
revisit 1
my 1
heart 1
warm 1
tears 1
filled 1
my 1
eyes 1
which 1
i 1
hastily 1
wiped 1
away 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
not 1
intercept 1
the 1
view 1
i 1
had 1
of 1
the 1
daemon 1
but 1
still 1
my 1
sight 1
was 1
dimmed 1
by 1
the 1
burning 1
drops 1
until 1
giving 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
emotions 1
that 1
oppressed 1
me 1
i 1
wept 1
aloud 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
time 1
for 1
delay 1
i 1
disencumbered 1
the 1
dogs 1
of 1
their 1
dead 1
companion 1
gave 1
them 1
a 1
plentiful 1
portion 1
of 1
food 1
and 1
after 1
an 1
hour 1
s 1
rest 1
which 1
was 1
absolutely 1
necessary 1
and 1
yet 1
which 1
was 1
bitterly 1
irksome 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
continued 1
my 1
route 1
the 1
sledge 1
was 1
still 1
visible 1
nor 1
did 1
i 1
again 1
lose 1
sight 1
of 1
it 1
except 1
at 1
the 1
moments 1
when 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
some 1
ice 1
rock 1
concealed 1
it 1
with 1
its 1
intervening 1
crags 1
i 1
indeed 1
perceptibly 1
gained 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
after 1
nearly 1
two 1
days 1
journey 1
i 1
beheld 1
my 1
enemy 1
at 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
mile 1
distant 1
my 1
heart 1
bounded 1
within 1
me 1
but 1
now 1
when 1
i 1
appeared 1
almost 1
within 1
grasp 1
of 1
my 1
foe 1
my 1
hopes 1
were 1
suddenly 1
extinguished 1
and 1
i 1
lost 1
all 1
trace 1
of 1
him 1
more 1
utterly 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
ever 1
done 1
before 1
a 1
ground 1
sea 1
was 1
heard 1
the 1
thunder 1
of 1
its 1
progress 1
as 1
the 1
waters 1
rolled 1
and 1
swelled 1
beneath 1
me 1
became 1
every 1
moment 1
more 1
ominous 1
and 1
terrific 1
i 1
pressed 1
on 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
the 1
wind 1
arose 1
the 1
sea 1
roared 1
and 1
as 1
with 1
the 1
mighty 1
shock 1
of 1
an 1
earthquake 1
it 1
split 1
and 1
cracked 1
with 1
a 1
tremendous 1
and 1
overwhelming 1
sound 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
soon 1
finished 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
a 1
tumultuous 1
sea 1
rolled 1
between 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
enemy 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
left 1
drifting 1
on 1
a 1
scattered 1
piece 1
of 1
ice 1
that 1
was 1
continually 1
lessening 1
and 1
thus 1
preparing 1
for 1
me 1
a 1
hideous 1
death 1
in 1
this 1
manner 1
many 1
appalling 1
hours 1
passed 1
several 1
of 1
my 1
dogs 1
died 1
and 1
i 1
myself 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
sink 1
under 1
the 1
accumulation 1
of 1
distress 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
your 1
vessel 1
riding 1
at 1
anchor 1
and 1
holding 1
forth 1
to 1
me 1
hopes 1
of 1
succour 1
and 1
life 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
conception 1
that 1
vessels 1
ever 1
came 1
so 1
far 1
north 1
and 1
was 1
astounded 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
i 1
quickly 1
destroyed 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
sledge 1
to 1
construct 1
oars 1
and 1
by 1
these 1
means 1
was 1
enabled 1
with 1
infinite 1
fatigue 1
to 1
move 1
my 1
ice 1
raft 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
your 1
ship 1
i 1
had 1
determined 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
southwards 1
still 1
to 1
trust 1
myself 1
to 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
the 1
seas 1
rather 1
than 1
abandon 1
my 1
purpose 1
i 1
hoped 1
to 1
induce 1
you 1
to 1
grant 1
me 1
a 1
boat 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
pursue 1
my 1
enemy 1
but 1
your 1
direction 1
was 1
northwards 1
you 1
took 1
me 1
on 1
board 1
when 1
my 1
vigour 1
was 1
exhausted 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
soon 1
have 1
sunk 1
under 1
my 1
multiplied 1
hardships 1
into 1
a 1
death 1
which 1
i 1
still 1
dread 1
for 1
my 1
task 1
is 1
unfulfilled 1
oh 1
when 1
will 1
my 1
guiding 1
spirit 1
in 1
conducting 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
daemon 1
allow 1
me 1
the 1
rest 1
i 1
so 1
much 1
desire 1
or 1
must 1
i 1
die 1
and 1
he 1
yet 1
live 1
if 1
i 1
do 1
swear 1
to 1
me 1
walton 1
that 1
he 1
shall 1
not 1
escape 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
seek 1
him 1
and 1
satisfy 1
my 1
vengeance 1
in 1
his 1
death 1
and 1
do 1
i 1
dare 1
to 1
ask 1
of 1
you 1
to 1
undertake 1
my 1
pilgrimage 1
to 1
endure 1
the 1
hardships 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
undergone 1
no 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
so 1
selfish 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
dead 1
if 1
he 1
should 1
appear 1
if 1
the 1
ministers 1
of 1
vengeance 1
should 1
conduct 1
him 1
to 1
you 1

shall 1
not 1

shall 1
not 1
triumph 1
over 1
my 1
accumulated 1
woes 1

survive 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
his 1
dark 1
crimes 1

his 1

you 1

this 1
strange 1

terrific 1
story 1

and 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
feel 1
your 1
blood 1
congeal 1
with 1
horror 1

that 1
which 1
even 1
now 1
curdles 1
mine 1
sometimes 1
seized 1
with 1
sudden 1
agony 1

his 1
tale 1

anguish 1
his 1
fine 1

lighted 1
up 1
with 1
indignation 1
now 1
subdued 1
to 1
downcast 1
sorrow 1
and 1
quenched 1
in 1
infinite 1
wretchedness 1
sometimes 1
he 1
commanded 1
his 1
countenance 1
and 1
tones 1
and 1
related 1
the 1
most 1
horrible 1
incidents 1
with 1
a 1
tranquil 1
voice 1
suppressing 1
every 1
mark 1
of 1
agitation 1
then 1
like 1
a 1
volcano 1
bursting 1
forth 1
his 1
face 1
would 1
suddenly 1
change 1
to 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
wildest 1
rage 1
as 1
he 1
shrieked 1
out 1
imprecations 1
on 1
his 1
persecutor 1
his 1
tale 1
is 1
connected 1
and 1
told 1
with 1
an 1
appearance 1
of 1
the 1
simplest 1
truth 1
yet 1
i 1
own 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
letters 1
of 1
felix 1
and 1
safie 1
which 1
he 1
showed 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
apparition 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
seen 1
from 1
our 1
ship 1
brought 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
greater 1
conviction 1
of 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
his 1
narrative 1
than 1
his 1
asseverations 1
however 1
earnest 1
and 1
connected 1
such 1
a 1
monster 1
has 1
then 1
really 1
existence 1
i 1
cannot 1
doubt 1
it 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
lost 1
in 1
surprise 1
and 1
admiration 1
sometimes 1
i 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
gain 1
from 1
frankenstein 1
the 1
particulars 1
of 1
his 1
creature 1
s 1
formation 1
but 1
on 1
this 1
point 1
he 1
was 1
impenetrable 1
are 1
you 1
mad 1
my 1
friend 1
said 1
he 1
or 1
whither 1
does 1
your 1
senseless 1
curiosity 1
lead 1
you 1
would 1
you 1
also 1
create 1
for 1
yourself 1
and 1
the 1
world 1
a 1
demoniacal 1
enemy 1
peace 1
peace 1
learn 1
my 1
miseries 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
seek 1
to 1
increase 1
your 1
own 1
frankenstein 1
discovered 1
that 1
i 1
made 1
notes 1
concerning 1
his 1
history 1
he 1
asked 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
himself 1
corrected 1
and 1
augmented 1
them 1
in 1
many 1
places 1
but 1
principally 1
in 1
giving 1
the 1
life 1
and 1
spirit 1
to 1
the 1
conversations 1
he 1
held 1
with 1
his 1
enemy 1
since 1
you 1
have 1
preserved 1
my 1
narration 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
that 1
a 1
mutilated 1
one 1
should 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
posterity 1
thus 1
has 1
a 1
week 1
passed 1
away 1
while 1
i 1
have 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
strangest 1
tale 1
that 1
ever 1
imagination 1
formed 1
my 1
thoughts 1
and 1
every 1
feeling 1
of 1
my 1
soul 1
have 1
been 1
drunk 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
interest 1
for 1
my 1
guest 1
which 1
this 1
tale 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
elevated 1
and 1
gentle 1
manners 1
have 1
created 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
soothe 1
him 1
yet 1
can 1
i 1
counsel 1
one 1
so 1
infinitely 1
miserable 1
so 1
destitute 1
of 1
every 1
hope 1
of 1
consolation 1
to 1
live 1
oh 1
no 1
the 1
only 1
joy 1
that 1
he 1
can 1
now 1
know 1
will 1
be 1
when 1
he 1
composes 1
his 1
shattered 1
spirit 1
to 1
peace 1
and 1
death 1
yet 1
he 1
enjoys 1
one 1
comfort 1
the 1
offspring 1
of 1
solitude 1
and 1
delirium 1
he 1
believes 1
that 1
when 1
in 1
dreams 1
he 1
holds 1
converse 1
with 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
derives 1
from 1
that 1
communion 1
consolation 1
for 1
his 1
miseries 1
or 1
excitements 1
to 1
his 1
vengeance 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
the 1
creations 1
of 1
his 1
fancy 1
but 1
the 1
beings 1
themselves 1
who 1
visit 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
regions 1
of 1
a 1
remote 1
world 1
this 1
faith 1
gives 1
a 1
solemnity 1
to 1
his 1
reveries 1
that 1
render 1
them 1
to 1
me 1
almost 1
as 1
imposing 1
and 1
interesting 1
as 1
truth 1
our 1
conversations 1
are 1
not 1
always 1
confined 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
history 1
and 1
misfortunes 1
on 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
general 1
literature 1
he 1
displays 1
unbounded 1
knowledge 1
and 1
a 1
quick 1
and 1
piercing 1
apprehension 1
his 1
eloquence 1
is 1
forcible 1
and 1
touching 1
nor 1
can 1
i 1
hear 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
relates 1
a 1
pathetic 1
incident 1
or 1
endeavours 1
to 1
move 1
the 1
passions 1
of 1
pity 1
or 1
love 1
without 1
tears 1
what 1
a 1
glorious 1
creature 1
must 1
he 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
his 1
prosperity 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
thus 1
noble 1
and 1
godlike 1
in 1
ruin 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
feel 1
his 1
own 1
worth 1
and 1
the 1
greatness 1
of 1
his 1
fall 1
when 1
younger 1
said 1
he 1
i 1
believed 1
myself 1
destined 1
for 1
some 1
great 1
enterprise 1
my 1
feelings 1
are 1
profound 1
but 1
i 1
possessed 1
a 1
coolness 1
of 1
judgment 1
that 1
fitted 1
me 1
for 1
illustrious 1
achievements 1
this 1
sentiment 1
of 1
the 1
worth 1
of 1
my 1
nature 1
supported 1
me 1
when 1
others 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
oppressed 1
for 1
i 1
deemed 1
it 1
criminal 1
to 1
throw 1
away 1
in 1
useless 1
grief 1
those 1
talents 1
that 1
might 1
be 1
useful 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
when 1
i 1
reflected 1
on 1
the 1
work 1
i 1
had 1
completed 1
no 1
less 1
a 1
one 1
than 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
sensitive 1
and 1
rational 1
animal 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
rank 1
myself 1
with 1
the 1
herd 1
of 1
common 1
projectors 1
but 1
this 1
thought 1
which 1
supported 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
my 1
career 1
now 1
serves 1
only 1
to 1
plunge 1
me 1
lower 1
in 1
the 1
dust 1
all 1
my 1
speculations 1
and 1
hopes 1
are 1
as 1
nothing 1
and 1
like 1
the 1
archangel 1
who 1
aspired 1
to 1
omnipotence 1
i 1
am 1
chained 1
in 1
an 1
eternal 1
hell 1
my 1
imagination 1
was 1
vivid 1
yet 1
my 1
powers 1
of 1
analysis 1
and 1
application 1
were 1
intense 1
by 1
the 1
union 1
of 1
these 1
qualities 1
i 1
conceived 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
executed 1
the 1
creation 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
even 1
now 1
i 1
cannot 1
recollect 1
without 1
passion 1
my 1
reveries 1
while 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
incomplete 1
i 1
trod 1
heaven 1
in 1
my 1
thoughts 1
now 1
exulting 1
in 1
my 1
powers 1
now 1
burning 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
their 1
effects 1
from 1
my 1
infancy 1
i 1
was 1
imbued 1
with 1
high 1
hopes 1
and 1
a 1
lofty 1
ambition 1
but 1
how 1
am 1
i 1
sunk 1
oh 1
my 1
friend 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
known 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
once 1
was 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
recognize 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
degradation 1
despondency 1
rarely 1
visited 1
my 1
heart 1
a 1
high 1
destiny 1
seemed 1
to 1
bear 1
me 1
on 1
until 1
i 1
fell 1
never 1
never 1
again 1
to 1
rise 1
must 1
i 1
then 1
lose 1
this 1
admirable 1
being 1
i 1
have 1
longed 1
for 1
a 1
friend 1
i 1
have 1
sought 1
one 1
who 1
would 1
sympathize 1
with 1
and 1
love 1
me 1
behold 1
on 1
these 1
desert 1
seas 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
but 1
i 1
fear 1
i 1
have 1
gained 1
him 1
only 1
to 1
know 1
his 1
value 1
and 1
lose 1
him 1
i 1
would 1
reconcile 1
him 1
to 1
life 1
but 1
he 1
repulses 1
the 1
idea 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
walton 1
he 1
said 1
for 1
your 1
kind 1
intentions 1
towards 1
so 1
miserable 1
a 1
wretch 1
but 1
when 1
you 1
speak 1
of 1
new 1
ties 1
and 1
fresh 1
affections 1
think 1
you 1
that 1
any 1
can 1
replace 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
gone 1
can 1
any 1
man 1
be 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
clerval 1
was 1
or 1
any 1
woman 1
another 1
elizabeth 1
even 1
where 1
the 1
affections 1
are 1
not 1
strongly 1
moved 1
by 1
any 1
superior 1
excellence 1
the 1
companions 1
of 1
our 1
childhood 1
always 1
possess 1
a 1
certain 1
power 1
over 1
our 1
minds 1
which 1
hardly 1
any 1
later 1
friend 1
can 1
obtain 1
they 1
know 1
our 1
infantine 1
dispositions 1
which 1
however 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
afterwards 1
modified 1
are 1
never 1
eradicated 1
and 1
they 1
can 1
judge 1
of 1
our 1
actions 1
with 1
more 1
certain 1
conclusions 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
integrity 1
of 1
our 1
motives 1
a 1
sister 1
or 1
a 1
brother 1
can 1
never 1
unless 1
indeed 1
such 1
symptoms 1
have 1
been 1
shown 1
early 1
suspect 1
the 1
other 1
of 1
fraud 1
or 1
false 1
dealing 1
when 1
another 1
friend 1
however 1
strongly 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
attached 1
may 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
be 1
contemplated 1
with 1
suspicion 1
but 1
i 1
enjoyed 1
friends 1
dear 1
not 1
only 1
through 1
habit 1
and 1
association 1
but 1
from 1
their 1
own 1
merits 1
and 1
wherever 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
soothing 1
voice 1
of 1
my 1
elizabeth 1
and 1
the 1
conversation 1
of 1
clerval 1
will 1
be 1
ever 1
whispered 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
they 1
are 1
dead 1
and 1
but 1
one 1
feeling 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
solitude 1
can 1
persuade 1
me 1
to 1
preserve 1
my 1
life 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
engaged 1
in 1
any 1
high 1
undertaking 1
or 1
design 1
fraught 1
with 1
extensive 1
utility 1
to 1
my 1
fellow 1
creatures 1
then 1
could 1
i 1
live 1
to 1
fulfil 1
it 1
but 1
such 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
destiny 1
i 1
must 1
pursue 1
and 1
destroy 1
the 1
being 1
to 1
whom 1
i 1
gave 1
existence 1
then 1
my 1
lot 1
on 1
earth 1
will 1
be 1
fulfilled 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
die 1
september 1
2nd 1
my 1
beloved 1
sister 1
i 1
write 1
to 1
you 1
encompassed 1
by 1
peril 1
and 1
ignorant 1
whether 1
i 1
am 1
ever 1
doomed 1
to 1
see 1
again 1
dear 1
england 1
and 1
the 1
dearer 1
friends 1
that 1
inhabit 1
it 1
i 1
am 1
surrounded 1
by 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
which 1
admit 1
of 1
no 1
escape 1
and 1
threaten 1
every 1
moment 1
to 1
crush 1
my 1
vessel 1
the 1
brave 1
fellows 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
persuaded 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
companions 1
look 1
towards 1
me 1
for 1
aid 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
none 1
to 1
bestow 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
terribly 1
appalling 1
in 1
our 1
situation 1
yet 1
my 1
courage 1
and 1
hopes 1
do 1
not 1
desert 1
me 1
yet 1
it 1
is 1
terrible 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
all 1
these 1
men 1
are 1
endangered 1
through 1
me 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
lost 1
my 1
mad 1
schemes 1
are 1
the 1
cause 1
and 1
what 1
margaret 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
your 1
mind 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
my 1
destruction 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
anxiously 1
await 1
my 1
return 1
years 1
will 1
pass 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
visitings 1
of 1
despair 1
and 1
yet 1
be 1
tortured 1
by 1
hope 1
oh 1
my 1
beloved 1
sister 1
the 1
sickening 1
failing 1
of 1
your 1
heart 1
felt 1
expectations 1
is 1
in 1
prospect 1
more 1
terrible 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
my 1
own 1
death 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
husband 1
and 1
lovely 1
children 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
happy 1
heaven 1
bless 1
you 1
and 1
make 1
you 1
so 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
guest 1
regards 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
tenderest 1
compassion 1
he 1
endeavours 1
to 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
hope 1
and 1
talks 1
as 1
if 1
life 1
were 1
a 1
possession 1
which 1
he 1
valued 1
he 1
reminds 1
me 1
how 1
often 1
the 1
same 1
accidents 1
have 1
happened 1
to 1
other 1

with 1

believe 1

september 1
5th 1
a 1
scene 1
has 1
just 1
passed 1
of 1
such 1
uncommon 1
interest 1
that 1
although 1
it 1
is 1
highly 1
probable 1
that 1
these 1
papers 1
may 1
never 1
reach 1
you 1
yet 1
i 1
cannot 1
forbear 1
recording 1
it 1
we 1
are 1
still 1
surrounded 1
by 1
mountains 1
of 1
ice 1
still 1
in 1
imminent 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
crushed 1
in 1
their 1
conflict 1
the 1
cold 1
is 1
excessive 1
and 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
comrades 1
have 1
already 1
found 1
a 1
grave 1
amidst 1
this 1
scene 1
of 1
desolation 1
frankenstein 1
has 1
daily 1
declined 1
in 1
health 1
a 1
feverish 1
fire 1
still 1
glimmers 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
exhausted 1
and 1
when 1
suddenly 1
roused 1
to 1
any 1
exertion 1
he 1
speedily 1
sinks 1
again 1
into 1
apparent 1
lifelessness 1
i 1
mentioned 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
letter 1
the 1
fears 1
i 1
entertained 1
of 1
a 1
mutiny 1
this 1
morning 1
as 1
i 1
sat 1
watching 1
the 1
wan 1
countenance 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
his 1
eyes 1
half 1
closed 1
and 1
his 1
limbs 1
hanging 1
listlessly 1
i 1
was 1
roused 1
by 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
of 1
the 1
sailors 1
who 1
demanded 1
admission 1
into 1
the 1
cabin 1
they 1
entered 1
and 1
their 1
leader 1
addressed 1
me 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
companions 1
had 1
been 1
chosen 1
by 1
the 1
other 1
sailors 1
to 1
come 1
in 1
deputation 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
a 1
requisition 1
which 1
in 1
justice 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
we 1
were 1
immured 1
in 1
ice 1
and 1
should 1
probably 1
never 1
escape 1
but 1
they 1
feared 1
that 1
if 1
as 1
was 1
possible 1
the 1
ice 1
should 1
dissipate 1
and 1
a 1
free 1
passage 1
be 1
opened 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
rash 1
enough 1
to 1
continue 1
my 1
voyage 1
and 1
lead 1
them 1
into 1
fresh 1
dangers 1
after 1
they 1
might 1
happily 1
have 1
surmounted 1
this 1
they 1
insisted 1
therefore 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
engage 1
with 1
a 1
solemn 1
promise 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
vessel 1
should 1
be 1
freed 1
i 1
would 1
instantly 1
direct 1
my 1
course 1
southwards 1
this 1
speech 1
troubled 1
me 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
despaired 1
nor 1
had 1
i 1
yet 1
conceived 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
returning 1
if 1
set 1
free 1
yet 1
could 1
i 1
in 1
justice 1
or 1
even 1
in 1
possibility 1
refuse 1
this 1
demand 1
i 1
hesitated 1
before 1
i 1
answered 1
when 1
frankenstein 1
who 1
had 1
at 1
first 1
been 1
silent 1
and 1
indeed 1
appeared 1
hardly 1
to 1
have 1
force 1
enough 1
to 1
attend 1
now 1
roused 1
himself 1
his 1
eyes 1
sparkled 1
and 1
his 1
cheeks 1
flushed 1
with 1
momentary 1
vigour 1
turning 1
towards 1
the 1
men 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
demand 1
of 1
your 1
captain 1
are 1
you 1
then 1
so 1
easily 1
turned 1
from 1
your 1
design 1
did 1
you 1
not 1
call 1
this 1
a 1
glorious 1
expedition 1
and 1
wherefore 1
was 1
it 1
glorious 1
not 1
because 1
the 1
way 1
was 1
smooth 1
and 1
placid 1
as 1
a 1
southern 1
sea 1
but 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
dangers 1
and 1
terror 1
because 1
at 1
every 1
new 1
incident 1
your 1
fortitude 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
called 1
forth 1
and 1
your 1
courage 1
exhibited 1
because 1
danger 1
and 1
death 1
surrounded 1
it 1
and 1
these 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
brave 1
and 1
overcome 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
it 1
a 1
glorious 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
it 1
an 1
honourable 1
undertaking 1
you 1
were 1
hereafter 1
to 1
be 1
hailed 1
as 1
the 1
benefactors 1
of 1
your 1
species 1
your 1
names 1
adored 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
brave 1
men 1
who 1
encountered 1
death 1
for 1
honour 1
and 1
the 1
benefit 1
of 1
mankind 1
and 1
now 1
behold 1
with 1
the 1
first 1
imagination 1
of 1
danger 1
or 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
the 1
first 1
mighty 1
and 1
terrific 1
trial 1
of 1
your 1
courage 1
you 1
shrink 1
away 1
and 1
are 1
content 1
to 1
be 1
handed 1
down 1
as 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
not 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
endure 1
cold 1
and 1
peril 1
and 1
so 1
poor 1
souls 1
they 1
were 1
chilly 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
their 1
warm 1
firesides 1
why 1
that 1
requires 1
not 1
this 1
preparation 1
ye 1
need 1
not 1
have 1
come 1
thus 1
far 1
and 1
dragged 1
your 1
captain 1
to 1
the 1
shame 1
of 1
a 1
defeat 1
merely 1
to 1
prove 1
yourselves 1
cowards 1
oh 1
be 1
men 1
or 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
men 1
be 1
steady 1
to 1
your 1
purposes 1
and 1
firm 1
as 1
a 1
rock 1
this 1
ice 1
is 1
not 1
made 1
of 1
such 1
stuff 1
as 1
your 1
hearts 1
may 1
be 1
it 1
is 1
mutable 1
and 1
cannot 1
withstand 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
shall 1
not 1
do 1
not 1
return 1
to 1
your 1
families 1
with 1
the 1
stigma 1
of 1
disgrace 1
marked 1
on 1
your 1
brows 1
return 1
as 1
heroes 1
who 1
have 1
fought 1
and 1
conquered 1
and 1
who 1
know 1
not 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
turn 1
their 1
backs 1
on 1
the 1
foe 1
he 1
spoke 1
this 1
with 1
a 1
voice 1
so 1
modulated 1
to 1
the 1
different 1
feelings 1
expressed 1
in 1
his 1
speech 1
with 1
an 1
eye 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
lofty 1
design 1
and 1
heroism 1
that 1
can 1
you 1
wonder 1
that 1
these 1
men 1
were 1
moved 1
they 1
looked 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
were 1
unable 1
to 1
reply 1
i 1
spoke 1
i 1
told 1
them 1
to 1
retire 1
and 1
consider 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
been 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
lead 1
them 1
farther 1
north 1
if 1
they 1
strenuously 1
desired 1
the 1
contrary 1
but 1
that 1
i 1
hoped 1
that 1
with 1
reflection 1
their 1
courage 1
would 1
return 1
they 1
retired 1
and 1
i 1
turned 1
towards 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
sunk 1
in 1
languor 1
and 1
almost 1
deprived 1
of 1
life 1
how 1
all 1
this 1
will 1
terminate 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
rather 1
die 1
than 1
return 1
shamefully 1
my 1
purpose 1
unfulfilled 1
yet 1
i 1
fear 1
such 1
will 1
be 1
my 1
fate 1
the 1
men 1
unsupported 1
by 1
ideas 1
of 1
glory 1
and 1
honour 1
can 1
never 1
willingly 1
continue 1
to 1
endure 1
their 1
present 1
hardships 1
september 1
7th 1
the 1
die 1
is 1
cast 1
i 1
have 1
consented 1
to 1
return 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
destroyed 1
thus 1
are 1
my 1
hopes 1
blasted 1
by 1
cowardice 1
and 1
indecision 1
i 1
come 1
back 1
ignorant 1
and 1
disappointed 1
it 1
requires 1
more 1
philosophy 1
than 1
i 1
possess 1
to 1
bear 1
this 1
injustice 1
with 1
patience 1
september 1
12th 1
it 1
is 1
past 1
i 1
am 1
returning 1
to 1
england 1
i 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
hopes 1
of 1
utility 1
and 1
glory 1
i 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
friend 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
endeavour 1
to 1
detail 1
these 1
bitter 1
circumstances 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
sister 1
and 1
while 1
i 1
am 1
wafted 1
towards 1
england 1
and 1
towards 1
you 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
despond 1
september 1
9th 1
the 1
ice 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
and 1
roarings 1
like 1
thunder 1
were 1
heard 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
as 1
the 1
islands 1
split 1
and 1
cracked 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
imminent 1
peril 1
but 1
as 1
we 1
could 1
only 1
remain 1
passive 1
my 1
chief 1
attention 1
was 1
occupied 1
by 1
my 1
unfortunate 1
guest 1
whose 1
illness 1
increased 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
degree 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
entirely 1
confined 1
to 1
his 1
bed 1
the 1
ice 1
cracked 1
behind 1
us 1
and 1
was 1
driven 1
with 1
force 1
towards 1
the 1
north 1
a 1
breeze 1
sprang 1
from 1
the 1
west 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
11th 1
the 1
passage 1
towards 1
the 1
south 1
became 1
perfectly 1
free 1
when 1
the 1
sailors 1
saw 1
this 1
and 1
that 1
their 1
return 1
to 1
their 1
native 1
country 1
was 1
apparently 1
assured 1
a 1
shout 1
of 1
tumultuous 1
joy 1
broke 1
from 1
them 1
loud 1
and 1
long 1
continued 1
frankenstein 1
who 1
was 1
dozing 1
awoke 1
and 1
asked 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
tumult 1
they 1
shout 1
i 1
said 1
because 1
they 1
will 1
soon 1
return 1
to 1
england 1
do 1
you 1
then 1
really 1
return 1
alas 1
yes 1
i 1
cannot 1
withstand 1
their 1
demands 1
i 1
cannot 1
lead 1
them 1
unwillingly 1
to 1
danger 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
return 1
do 1
so 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
you 1
may 1
give 1
up 1
your 1
purpose 1
but 1
mine 1
is 1
assigned 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
heaven 1
and 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
i 1
am 1
weak 1
but 1
surely 1
the 1
spirits 1
who 1
assist 1
my 1
vengeance 1
will 1
endow 1
me 1
with 1
sufficient 1
strength 1
saying 1
this 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
spring 1
from 1
the 1
bed 1
but 1
the 1
exertion 1
was 1
too 1
great 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
fell 1
back 1
and 1
fainted 1
it 1
was 1
long 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
restored 1
and 1
i 1
often 1
thought 1
that 1
life 1
was 1
entirely 1
extinct 1
at 1
length 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
he 1
breathed 1
with 1
difficulty 1
and 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
surgeon 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
composing 1
draught 1
and 1
ordered 1
us 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
undisturbed 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
my 1
friend 1
had 1
certainly 1
not 1
many 1
hours 1
to 1
live 1
his 1
sentence 1
was 1
pronounced 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
grieve 1
and 1
be 1
patient 1
i 1
sat 1
by 1
his 1
bed 1
watching 1
him 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
closed 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
he 1
slept 1
but 1
presently 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
feeble 1
voice 1
and 1
bidding 1
me 1
come 1
near 1
said 1
alas 1
the 1
strength 1
i 1
relied 1
on 1
is 1
gone 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
soon 1
die 1
and 1
he 1
my 1
enemy 1
and 1
persecutor 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
in 1
being 1
think 1
not 1
walton 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
moments 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
burning 1
hatred 1
and 1
ardent 1
desire 1
of 1
revenge 1
i 1
once 1
expressed 1
but 1
i 1
feel 1
myself 1
justified 1
in 1
desiring 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
my 1
adversary 1
during 1
these 1
last 1
days 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
occupied 1
in 1
examining 1
my 1
past 1
conduct 1
nor 1
do 1
i 1
find 1
it 1
blamable 1
in 1
a 1
fit 1
of 1
enthusiastic 1
madness 1
i 1
created 1
a 1
rational 1
creature 1
and 1
was 1
bound 1
towards 1
him 1
to 1
assure 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
his 1
happiness 1
and 1
well 1
being 1
this 1
was 1
my 1
duty 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
still 1
paramount 1
to 1
that 1
my 1
duties 1
towards 1
the 1
beings 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
species 1
had 1
greater 1
claims 1
to 1
my 1
attention 1
because 1
they 1
included 1
a 1
greater 1
proportion 1
of 1
happiness 1
or 1
misery 1
urged 1
by 1
this 1
view 1
i 1
refused 1
and 1
i 1
did 1
right 1
in 1
refusing 1
to 1
create 1
a 1
companion 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
creature 1
he 1
showed 1
unparalleled 1
malignity 1
and 1
selfishness 1
in 1
evil 1
he 1
destroyed 1
my 1
friends 1
he 1
devoted 1
to 1
destruction 1
beings 1
who 1
possessed 1
exquisite 1
sensations 1
happiness 1
and 1
wisdom 1
nor 1
do 1
i 1
know 1
where 1
this 1
thirst 1
for 1
vengeance 1
may 1
end 1
miserable 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
render 1
no 1
other 1
wretched 1
he 1
ought 1
to 1
die 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
his 1
destruction 1
was 1
mine 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
failed 1
when 1
actuated 1
by 1
selfish 1
and 1
vicious 1
motives 1
i 1
asked 1
you 1
to 1
undertake 1
my 1
unfinished 1
work 1
and 1
i 1
renew 1
this 1
request 1
now 1
when 1
i 1
am 1
only 1
induced 1
by 1
reason 1
and 1
virtue 1
yet 1
i 1
cannot 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
renounce 1
your 1
country 1
and 1
friends 1
to 1
fulfil 1
this 1
task 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
returning 1
to 1
england 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
little 1
chance 1
of 1
meeting 1
with 1
him 1
but 1
the 1
consideration 1
of 1
these 1
points 1
and 1
the 1
well 1
balancing 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
may 1
esteem 1
your 1
duties 1
i 1
leave 1
to 1
you 1
my 1
judgment 1
and 1
ideas 1
are 1
already 1
disturbed 1
by 1
the 1
near 1
approach 1
of 1
death 1
i 1
dare 1
not 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
think 1
right 1
for 1
i 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
misled 1
by 1
passion 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
live 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
instrument 1
of 1
mischief 1
disturbs 1
me 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
this 1
hour 1
when 1
i 1
momentarily 1
expect 1
my 1
release 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
happy 1
one 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
enjoyed 1
for 1
several 1
years 1
the 1
forms 1
of 1
the 1
beloved 1
dead 1
flit 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
i 1
hasten 1
to 1
their 1
arms 1
farewell 1
walton 1
seek 1
happiness 1
in 1
tranquillity 1
and 1
avoid 1
ambition 1
even 1
if 1
it 1
be 1
only 1
the 1
apparently 1
innocent 1
one 1
of 1
distinguishing 1
yourself 1
in 1
science 1
and 1
discoveries 1
yet 1
why 1
do 1
i 1
say 1
this 1
i 1
have 1
myself 1
been 1
blasted 1
in 1
these 1
hopes 1
yet 1
another 1
may 1
succeed 1
his 1
voice 1
became 1
fainter 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
at 1
length 1
exhausted 1
by 1
his 1
effort 1
he 1
sank 1
into 1
silence 1
about 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
afterwards 1
he 1
attempted 1
again 1
to 1
speak 1
but 1
was 1
unable 1
he 1
pressed 1
my 1
hand 1
feebly 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
closed 1
forever 1
while 1
the 1
irradiation 1
of 1
a 1
gentle 1
smile 1
passed 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
margaret 1
what 1
comment 1
can 1
i 1
make 1
on 1
the 1
untimely 1
extinction 1
of 1
this 1
glorious 1
spirit 1
what 1
can 1
i 1
say 1
that 1
will 1
enable 1
you 1
to 1
understand 1
the 1
depth 1
of 1
my 1
sorrow 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
express 1
would 1
be 1
inadequate 1
and 1
feeble 1
my 1
tears 1
flow 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
overshadowed 1
by 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
disappointment 1
but 1
i 1
journey 1
towards 1
england 1
and 1
i 1
may 1
there 1
find 1
consolation 1
i 1
am 1
interrupted 1
what 1
do 1
these 1
sounds 1
portend 1
it 1
is 1
midnight 1
the 1
breeze 1
blows 1
fairly 1
and 1
the 1
watch 1
on 1
deck 1
scarcely 1
stir 1
again 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
sound 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
human 1
voice 1
but 1
hoarser 1
it 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
cabin 1
where 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
frankenstein 1
still 1
lie 1
i 1
must 1
arise 1
and 1
examine 1
good 1
night 1
my 1
sister 1
great 1
god 1
what 1
a 1
scene 1
has 1
just 1
taken 1
place 1
i 1
am 1
yet 1
dizzy 1
with 1
the 1
remembrance 1
of 1
it 1
i 1
hardly 1
know 1
whether 1
i 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
detail 1
it 1
yet 1
the 1
tale 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
recorded 1
would 1
be 1
incomplete 1
without 1
this 1
final 1
and 1
wonderful 1
catastrophe 1
i 1
entered 1
the 1
cabin 1
where 1
lay 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
my 1
ill 1
fated 1
and 1
admirable 1
friend 1
over 1
him 1
hung 1
a 1
form 1
which 1
i 1
cannot 1
find 1
words 1
to 1
describe 1
gigantic 1
in 1
stature 1
yet 1
uncouth 1
and 1
distorted 1
in 1
its 1
proportions 1
as 1
he 1
hung 1
over 1
the 1
coffin 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
concealed 1
by 1
long 1
locks 1
of 1
ragged 1
hair 1
but 1
one 1
vast 1
hand 1
was 1
extended 1
in 1
colour 1
and 1
apparent 1
texture 1
like 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
mummy 1
when 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
my 1
approach 1
he 1
ceased 1
to 1
utter 1
exclamations 1
of 1
grief 1
and 1
horror 1
and 1
sprung 1
towards 1
the 1
window 1
never 1
did 1
i 1
behold 1
a 1
vision 1
so 1
horrible 1
as 1
his 1
face 1
of 1
such 1
loathsome 1
yet 1
appalling 1
hideousness 1
i 1
shut 1
my 1
eyes 1
involuntarily 1
and 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
recollect 1
what 1
were 1
my 1
duties 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
this 1
destroyer 1
i 1
called 1
on 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
he 1
paused 1
looking 1
on 1
me 1
with 1
wonder 1
and 1
again 1
turning 1
towards 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
his 1
creator 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
forget 1
my 1
presence 1
and 1
every 1
feature 1
and 1
gesture 1
seemed 1
instigated 1
by 1
the 1
wildest 1
rage 1
of 1
some 1
uncontrollable 1
passion 1
that 1
is 1
also 1
my 1
victim 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
in 1
his 1
murder 1
my 1
crimes 1
are 1
consummated 1
the 1
miserable 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
is 1
wound 1
to 1
its 1
close 1
oh 1
frankenstein 1
generous 1
and 1
self 1
devoted 1
being 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
avail 1
that 1
i 1
now 1
ask 1
thee 1
to 1
pardon 1
me 1
i 1
who 1
irretrievably 1
destroyed 1
thee 1
by 1
destroying 1
all 1
thou 1
lovedst 1
alas 1
he 1
is 1
cold 1
he 1
cannot 1
answer 1
me 1
his 1
voice 1
seemed 1
suffocated 1
and 1
my 1
first 1
impulses 1
which 1
had 1
suggested 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
duty 1
of 1
obeying 1
the 1
dying 1
request 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
in 1
destroying 1
his 1
enemy 1
were 1
now 1
suspended 1
by 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
curiosity 1
and 1
compassion 1
i 1
approached 1
this 1
tremendous 1
being 1
i 1
dared 1
not 1
again 1
raise 1
my 1
eyes 1
to 1
his 1
face 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
so 1
scaring 1
and 1
unearthly 1
in 1
his 1
ugliness 1
i 1
attempted 1
to 1
speak 1
but 1
the 1
words 1
died 1
away 1
on 1
my 1
lips 1
the 1
monster 1
continued 1
to 1
utter 1
wild 1
and 1
incoherent 1
self 1
reproaches 1
at 1
length 1
i 1
gathered 1
resolution 1
to 1
address 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
pause 1
of 1
the 1
tempest 1
of 1
his 1
passion 1
your 1
repentance 1
i 1
said 1
is 1
now 1
superfluous 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
listened 1
to 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
conscience 1
and 1
heeded 1
the 1
stings 1
of 1
remorse 1
before 1
you 1
had 1
urged 1
your 1
diabolical 1
vengeance 1
to 1
this 1
extremity 1
frankenstein 1
would 1
yet 1
have 1
lived 1
and 1
do 1
you 1
dream 1
said 1
the 1
daemon 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
then 1
dead 1
to 1
agony 1
and 1
remorse 1
he 1
he 1
continued 1
pointing 1
to 1
the 1
corpse 1
he 1
suffered 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
consummation 1
of 1
the 1
deed 1
oh 1
not 1
the 1
ten 1
thousandth 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
anguish 1
that 1
was 1
mine 1
during 1
the 1
lingering 1
detail 1
of 1
its 1
execution 1
a 1
frightful 1
selfishness 1
hurried 1
me 1
on 1
while 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
poisoned 1
with 1
remorse 1
think 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
groans 1
of 1
clerval 1
were 1
music 1
to 1
my 1
ears 1
my 1
heart 1
was 1
fashioned 1
to 1
be 1
susceptible 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
sympathy 1
and 1
when 1
wrenched 1
by 1
misery 1
to 1
vice 1
and 1
hatred 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
endure 1
the 1
violence 1
of 1
the 1
change 1
without 1
torture 1
such 1
as 1
you 1
cannot 1
even 1
imagine 1
after 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
clerval 1
i 1
returned 1
to 1
switzerland 1
heart 1
broken 1
and 1
overcome 1
i 1
pitied 1
frankenstein 1
my 1
pity 1
amounted 1
to 1
horror 1
i 1
abhorred 1
myself 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
the 1
author 1
at 1
once 1
of 1
my 1
existence 1
and 1
of 1
its 1
unspeakable 1
torments 1
dared 1
to 1
hope 1
for 1
happiness 1
that 1
while 1
he 1
accumulated 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
despair 1
upon 1
me 1
he 1
sought 1
his 1
own 1
enjoyment 1
in 1
feelings 1
and 1
passions 1
from 1
the 1
indulgence 1
of 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
forever 1
barred 1
then 1
impotent 1
envy 1
and 1
bitter 1
indignation 1
filled 1
me 1
with 1
an 1
insatiable 1
thirst 1
for 1
vengeance 1
i 1
recollected 1
my 1
threat 1
and 1
resolved 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
accomplished 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
preparing 1
for 1
myself 1
a 1
deadly 1
torture 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
slave 1
not 1
the 1
master 1
of 1
an 1
impulse 1
which 1
i 1
detested 1
yet 1
could 1
not 1
disobey 1
yet 1
when 1
she 1
died 1
nay 1
then 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
miserable 1
i 1
had 1
cast 1
off 1
all 1
feeling 1
subdued 1
all 1
anguish 1
to 1
riot 1
in 1
the 1
excess 1
of 1
my 1
despair 1
evil 1
thenceforth 1
became 1
my 1
good 1
urged 1
thus 1
far 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
adapt 1
my 1
nature 1
to 1
an 1
element 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
willingly 1
chosen 1
the 1
completion 1
of 1
my 1
demoniacal 1
design 1
became 1
an 1
insatiable 1
passion 1
and 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
ended 1
there 1
is 1
my 1
last 1
victim 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
first 1
touched 1
by 1
the 1
expressions 1
of 1
his 1
misery 1
yet 1
when 1
i 1
called 1
to 1
mind 1
what 1
frankenstein 1
had 1
said 1
of 1
his 1
powers 1
of 1
eloquence 1
and 1
persuasion 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
again 1
cast 1
my 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
lifeless 1
form 1
of 1
my 1
friend 1
indignation 1
was 1
rekindled 1
within 1
me 1
wretch 1
i 1
said 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
that 1
you 1
come 1
here 1
to 1
whine 1
over 1
the 1
desolation 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
throw 1
a 1
torch 1
into 1
a 1
pile 1
of 1
buildings 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
are 1
consumed 1
you 1
sit 1
among 1
the 1
ruins 1
and 1
lament 1
the 1
fall 1
hypocritical 1
fiend 1
if 1
he 1
whom 1
you 1
mourn 1
still 1
lived 1
still 1
would 1
he 1
be 1
the 1
object 1
again 1
would 1
he 1
become 1
the 1
prey 1
of 1
your 1
accursed 1
vengeance 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
pity 1
that 1
you 1
feel 1
you 1
lament 1
only 1
because 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
your 1
malignity 1
is 1
withdrawn 1
from 1
your 1
power 1
oh 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
thus 1
not 1
thus 1
interrupted 1
the 1
being 1
yet 1
such 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
impression 1
conveyed 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
what 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
purport 1
of 1
my 1
actions 1
yet 1
i 1
seek 1
not 1
a 1
fellow 1
feeling 1
in 1
my 1
misery 1
no 1
sympathy 1
may 1
i 1
ever 1
find 1
when 1
i 1
first 1
sought 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
virtue 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
happiness 1
and 1
affection 1
with 1
which 1
my 1
whole 1
being 1
overflowed 1
that 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
participated 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
virtue 1
has 1
become 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
that 1
happiness 1
and 1
affection 1
are 1
turned 1
into 1
bitter 1
and 1
loathing 1
despair 1
in 1
what 1
should 1
i 1
seek 1
for 1
sympathy 1
i 1
am 1
content 1
to 1
suffer 1
alone 1
while 1
my 1
sufferings 1
shall 1
endure 1
when 1
i 1
die 1
i 1
am 1
well 1
satisfied 1
that 1
abhorrence 1
and 1
opprobrium 1
should 1
load 1
my 1
memory 1
once 1
my 1
fancy 1
was 1
soothed 1
with 1
dreams 1
of 1
virtue 1
of 1
fame 1
and 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
once 1
i 1
falsely 1
hoped 1
to 1
meet 1
with 1
beings 1
who 1
pardoning 1
my 1
outward 1
form 1
would 1
love 1
me 1
for 1
the 1
excellent 1
qualities 1
which 1
i 1
was 1
capable 1
of 1
unfolding 1
i 1
was 1
nourished 1
with 1
high 1
thoughts 1
of 1
honour 1
and 1
devotion 1
but 1
now 1
crime 1
has 1
degraded 1
me 1
beneath 1
the 1
meanest 1
animal 1
no 1
guilt 1
no 1
mischief 1
no 1
malignity 1
no 1
misery 1
can 1
be 1
found 1
comparable 1
to 1
mine 1
when 1
i 1
run 1
over 1
the 1
frightful 1
catalogue 1
of 1
my 1
sins 1
i 1
cannot 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
same 1
creature 1
whose 1
thoughts 1
were 1
once 1
filled 1
with 1
sublime 1
and 1
transcendent 1
visions 1
of 1
the 1
beauty 1
and 1
the 1
majesty 1
of 1
goodness 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
even 1
so 1
the 1
fallen 1
angel 1
becomes 1
a 1
malignant 1
devil 1
yet 1
even 1
that 1
enemy 1
of 1
god 1
and 1
man 1
had 1
friends 1
and 1
associates 1
in 1
his 1
desolation 1
i 1
am 1
alone 1
you 1
who 1
call 1
frankenstein 1
your 1
friend 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
knowledge 1
of 1
my 1
crimes 1
and 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
detail 1
which 1
he 1
gave 1
you 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
sum 1
up 1
the 1
hours 1
and 1
months 1
of 1
misery 1
which 1
i 1
endured 1
wasting 1
in 1
impotent 1
passions 1
for 1
while 1
i 1
destroyed 1
his 1
hopes 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
satisfy 1
my 1
own 1
desires 1
they 1
were 1
forever 1
ardent 1
and 1
craving 1
still 1
i 1
desired 1
love 1
and 1
fellowship 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
spurned 1
was 1
there 1
no 1
injustice 1
in 1
this 1
am 1
i 1
to 1
be 1
thought 1
the 1
only 1
criminal 1
when 1
all 1
humankind 1
sinned 1
against 1
me 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
hate 1
felix 1
who 1
drove 1
his 1
friend 1
from 1
his 1
door 1
with 1
contumely 1
why 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
execrate 1
the 1
rustic 1
who 1
sought 1
to 1
destroy 1
the 1
saviour 1
of 1
his 1
child 1
nay 1
these 1
are 1
virtuous 1
and 1
immaculate 1
beings 1
i 1
the 1
miserable 1
and 1
the 1
abandoned 1
am 1
an 1
abortion 1
to 1
be 1
spurned 1
at 1
and 1
kicked 1
and 1
trampled 1
on 1
even 1
now 1
my 1
blood 1
boils 1
at 1
the 1
recollection 1
of 1
this 1
injustice 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
wretch 1
i 1
have 1
murdered 1
the 1
lovely 1
and 1
the 1
helpless 1
i 1
have 1
strangled 1
the 1
innocent 1
as 1
they 1
slept 1
and 1
grasped 1
to 1
death 1
his 1
throat 1
who 1
never 1
injured 1
me 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
living 1
thing 1
i 1
have 1
devoted 1
my 1
creator 1
the 1
select 1
specimen 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
worthy 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
admiration 1
among 1
men 1
to 1
misery 1
i 1
have 1
pursued 1
him 1
even 1
to 1
that 1
irremediable 1
ruin 1
there 1
he 1
lies 1
white 1
and 1
cold 1
in 1
death 1
you 1
hate 1
me 1
but 1
your 1
abhorrence 1
cannot 1
equal 1
that 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
regard 1
myself 1
i 1
look 1
on 1
the 1
hands 1
which 1
executed 1
the 1
deed 1
i 1
think 1
on 1
the 1
heart 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
conceived 1
and 1
long 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
these 1
hands 1
will 1
meet 1
my 1
eyes 1
when 1
that 1
imagination 1
will 1
haunt 1
my 1
thoughts 1
no 1
more 1
fear 1
not 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
the 1
instrument 1
of 1
future 1
mischief 1
my 1
work 1
is 1
nearly 1
complete 1
neither 1
yours 1
nor 1
any 1
man 1
s 1
death 1
is 1
needed 1
to 1
consummate 1
the 1
series 1
of 1
my 1
being 1
and 1
accomplish 1
that 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
but 1
it 1
requires 1
my 1
own 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
slow 1
to 1
perform 1
this 1
sacrifice 1
i 1
shall 1
quit 1
your 1
vessel 1
on 1
the 1
ice 1
raft 1
which 1
brought 1
me 1
thither 1
and 1
shall 1
seek 1
the 1
most 1
northern 1
extremity 1
of 1
the 1
globe 1
i 1
shall 1
collect 1
my 1
funeral 1
pile 1
and 1
consume 1
to 1
ashes 1
this 1
miserable 1
frame 1
that 1
its 1
remains 1
may 1
afford 1
no 1
light 1
to 1
any 1
curious 1
and 1
unhallowed 1
wretch 1
who 1
would 1
create 1
such 1
another 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
i 1
shall 1
die 1
i 1
shall 1
no 1
longer 1
feel 1
the 1
agonies 1
which 1
now 1
consume 1
me 1
or 1
be 1
the 1
prey 1
of 1
feelings 1
unsatisfied 1
yet 1
unquenched 1
he 1
is 1
dead 1
who 1
called 1
me 1
into 1
being 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
no 1
more 1
the 1
very 1
remembrance 1
of 1
us 1
both 1
will 1
speedily 1
vanish 1
i 1
shall 1
no 1
longer 1
see 1
the 1
sun 1
or 1
stars 1
or 1
feel 1
the 1
winds 1
play 1
on 1
my 1
cheeks 1
light 1
feeling 1
and 1
sense 1
will 1
pass 1
away 1
and 1
in 1
this 1
condition 1
must 1
i 1
find 1
my 1
happiness 1
some 1
years 1
ago 1
when 1
the 1
images 1
which 1
this 1
world 1
affords 1
first 1
opened 1
upon 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
felt 1
the 1
cheering 1
warmth 1
of 1
summer 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
rustling 1
of 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
the 1
warbling 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
these 1
were 1
all 1
to 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
wept 1
to 1
die 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
only 1
consolation 1
polluted 1
by 1
crimes 1
and 1
torn 1
by 1
the 1
bitterest 1
remorse 1
where 1
can 1
i 1
find 1
rest 1
but 1
in 1
death 1
farewell 1
i 1
leave 1
you 1
and 1
in 1
you 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
humankind 1
whom 1
these 1
eyes 1
will 1
ever 1
behold 1
farewell 1
frankenstein 1
if 1
thou 1
wert 1
yet 1
alive 1
and 1
yet 1
cherished 1
a 1
desire 1
of 1
revenge 1
against 1
me 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
satiated 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
than 1
in 1
my 1
destruction 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
thou 1
didst 1
seek 1
my 1
extinction 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
not 1
cause 1
greater 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
if 1
yet 1
in 1
some 1
mode 1
unknown 1
to 1
me 1
thou 1
hadst 1
not 1
ceased 1
to 1
think 1
and 1
feel 1
thou 1
wouldst 1
not 1
desire 1
against 1
me 1
a 1
vengeance 1
greater 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
i 1
feel 1
blasted 1
as 1
thou 1
wert 1
my 1
agony 1
was 1
still 1
superior 1
to 1
thine 1
for 1
the 1
bitter 1
sting 1
of 1
remorse 1
will 1
not 1
cease 1
to 1
rankle 1
in 1
my 1
wounds 1
until 1
death 1
shall 1
close 1
them 1
forever 1
but 1
soon 1
he 1
cried 1
with 1
sad 1
and 1
solemn 1
enthusiasm 1
i 1
shall 1
die 1
and 1
what 1
i 1
now 1
feel 1
be 1
no 1
longer 1
felt 1
soon 1
these 1
burning 1
miseries 1
will 1
be 1
extinct 1
i 1
shall 1
ascend 1
my 1
funeral 1
pile 1
triumphantly 1
and 1
exult 1
in 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
the 1
torturing 1
flames 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
that 1
conflagration 1
will 1
fade 1
away 1
my 1
ashes 1
will 1
be 1
swept 1
into 1
the 1
sea 1
by 1
the 1
winds 1
my 1
spirit 1
will 1
sleep 1

peace 1

it 1
thinks 1
it 1

lord 1
greystoke 1
he 1
who 1

sat 1

in 1

friend 1
lieutenant 1
paul 1
d 1
arnot 1
in 1
paris 1
gazing 1
meditatively 1
at 1
the 1
toe 1
of 1
his 1
immaculate 1
boot 1
his 1
mind 1
revolved 1
many 1
memories 1
recalled 1
by 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
his 1
arch 1
enemy 1
from 1
the 1
french 1
military 1
prison 1
to 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
sentenced 1
for 1
life 1
upon 1
the 1
testimony 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
lengths 1
to 1
which 1
rokoff 1
had 1
once 1
gone 1
to 1
compass 1
his 1
death 1
and 1
he 1
realized 1
that 1
what 1
the 1
man 1
had 1
already 1
done 1
would 1
doubtless 1
be 1
as 1
nothing 1
by 1
comparison 1
with 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
wish 1
and 1
plot 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
again 1
free 1
tarzan 1
had 1
recently 1
brought 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
infant 1
son 1
to 1
london 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
discomforts 1
and 1
dangers 1
of 1
the 1
rainy 1
season 1
upon 1
their 1
vast 1
estate 1
in 1
uziri 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
waziri 1
warriors 1
whose 1
broad 1
african 1
domains 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
once 1
ruled 1
he 1
had 1
run 1
across 1
the 1
channel 1
for 1
a 1
brief 1
visit 1
with 1
his 1
old 1
friend 1
but 1
the 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
escape 1
had 1
already 1
cast 1
a 1
shadow 1
upon 1
his 1
outing 1
so 1
that 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
just 1
arrived 1
he 1
was 1
already 1
contemplating 1
an 1
immediate 1
return 1
to 1
london 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
i 1
fear 1
for 1
myself 1
paul 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last 1
many 1
times 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
have 1
i 1
thwarted 1
rokoff 1
s 1
designs 1
upon 1
my 1
life 1
but 1
now 1
there 1
are 1
others 1
to 1
consider 1
unless 1
i 1
misjudge 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
would 1
more 1
quickly 1
strike 1
at 1
me 1
through 1
my 1
wife 1
or 1
son 1
than 1
directly 1
at 1
me 1
for 1
he 1
doubtless 1
realizes 1
that 1
in 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
could 1
he 1
inflict 1
greater 1
anguish 1
upon 1
me 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
them 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
remain 1
with 1
them 1
until 1
rokoff 1
is 1
recaptured 1
or 1
dead 1
as 1
these 1
two 1
talked 1
in 1
paris 1
two 1
other 1
men 1
were 1
talking 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
cottage 1
upon 1
the 1
outskirts 1
of 1
london 1
both 1
were 1
dark 1
sinister 1
looking 1
men 1
one 1
was 1
bearded 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
whose 1
face 1
wore 1
the 1
pallor 1
of 1
long 1
confinement 1
within 1
doors 1
had 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
growth 1
of 1
black 1
beard 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
was 1
speaking 1
you 1
must 1
needs 1
shave 1
off 1
that 1
beard 1
of 1
yours 1
alexis 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
companion 1
with 1
it 1
he 1
would 1
recognize 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
instant 1
we 1
must 1
separate 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
hour 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
meet 1
again 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
let 1
us 1
hope 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
with 1
us 1
two 1
honoured 1
guests 1
who 1
little 1
anticipate 1
the 1
pleasant 1
voyage 1
we 1
have 1
planned 1
for 1
them 1
in 1
two 1
hours 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
upon 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
dover 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
by 1
tomorrow 1
night 1
if 1
you 1
follow 1
my 1
instructions 1
carefully 1
you 1
should 1
arrive 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
provided 1
of 1
course 1
that 1
he 1
returns 1
to 1
london 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
i 1
presume 1
he 1
will 1
there 1
should 1
be 1
both 1
profit 1
and 1
pleasure 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
other 1
good 1
things 1
to 1
reward 1
our 1
efforts 1
my 1
dear 1
alexis 1
thanks 1
to 1
the 1
stupidity 1
of 1
the 1
french 1
they 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
such 1
lengths 1
to 1
conceal 1
the 1
fact 1
of 1
my 1
escape 1
for 1
these 1
many 1
days 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
ample 1
opportunity 1
to 1
work 1
out 1
every 1
detail 1
of 1
our 1
little 1
adventure 1
so 1
carefully 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
little 1
chance 1
of 1
the 1
slightest 1
hitch 1
occurring 1
to 1
mar 1
our 1
prospects 1
and 1
now 1
good 1
bye 1
and 1
good 1
luck 1
three 1
hours 1
later 1
a 1
messenger 1
mounted 1
the 1
steps 1
to 1
the 1
apartment 1
of 1
lieutenant 1
d 1
arnot 1
a 1
telegram 1
for 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
servant 1
who 1
answered 1
his 1
summons 1
is 1
he 1
here 1
the 1
man 1
answered 1
in 1
the 1
affirmative 1
and 1
signing 1
for 1
the 1
message 1
carried 1
it 1
within 1
to 1
tarzan 1
who 1
was 1
already 1
preparing 1
to 1
depart 1
for 1
london 1
tarzan 1
tore 1
open 1
the 1
envelope 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
read 1
his 1
face 1
went 1
white 1
read 1
it 1
paul 1
he 1
said 1
handing 1
the 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
to 1
d 1
arnot 1
it 1
has 1
come 1
already 1
the 1
frenchman 1
took 1
the 1
telegram 1
and 1
read 1
jack 1
stolen 1
from 1
the 1
garden 1
through 1
complicity 1
of 1
new 1
servant 1
come 1
at 1
once 1
jane 1
as 1
tarzan 1
leaped 1
from 1
the 1
roadster 1
that 1
had 1
met 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
and 1
ran 1
up 1
the 1
steps 1
to 1
his 1
london 1
town 1
house 1
he 1
was 1
met 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
by 1
a 1
dry 1
eyed 1
but 1
almost 1
frantic 1
woman 1
quickly 1
jane 1
porter 1
clayton 1
narrated 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
learn 1
of 1
the 1
theft 1
of 1
the 1
boy 1
the 1
baby 1
s 1
nurse 1
had 1
been 1
wheeling 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
sunshine 1
on 1
the 1
walk 1
before 1
the 1
house 1
when 1
a 1
closed 1
taxicab 1
drew 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
paid 1
but 1
passing 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
vehicle 1
merely 1
noting 1
that 1
it 1
discharged 1
no 1
passenger 1
but 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
kerb 1
with 1
the 1
motor 1
running 1
as 1
though 1
waiting 1
for 1
a 1
fare 1
from 1
the 1
residence 1
before 1
which 1
it 1
had 1
stopped 1
almost 1
immediately 1
the 1
new 1
houseman 1
carl 1
had 1
come 1
running 1
from 1
the 1
greystoke 1
house 1
saying 1
that 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
mistress 1
wished 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
leave 1
little 1
jack 1
in 1
his 1
care 1
until 1
she 1
returned 1
the 1
woman 1
said 1
that 1
she 1
entertained 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
suspicion 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
motives 1
until 1
she 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
doorway 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
when 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
warn 1
him 1
not 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
carriage 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
permit 1
the 1
sun 1
to 1
shine 1
in 1
the 1
baby 1
s 1
eyes 1
as 1
she 1
turned 1
about 1
to 1
call 1
this 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
was 1
somewhat 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
wheeling 1
the 1
carriage 1
rapidly 1
toward 1
the 1
corner 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
taxicab 1
open 1
and 1
a 1
swarthy 1
face 1
framed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
in 1
the 1
aperture 1
intuitively 1
the 1
danger 1
to 1
the 1
child 1
flashed 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
shriek 1
she 1
dashed 1
down 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
up 1
the 1
walk 1
toward 1
the 1
taxicab 1
into 1
which 1
carl 1
was 1
now 1
handing 1
the 1
baby 1
to 1
the 1
swarthy 1
one 1
within 1
just 1
before 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
vehicle 1
carl 1
leaped 1
in 1
beside 1
his 1
confederate 1
slamming 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
the 1
chauffeur 1
attempted 1
to 1
start 1
his 1
machine 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
gone 1
wrong 1
as 1
though 1
the 1
gears 1
refused 1
to 1
mesh 1
and 1
the 1
delay 1
caused 1
by 1
this 1
while 1
he 1
pushed 1
the 1
lever 1
into 1
reverse 1
and 1
backed 1
the 1
car 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
before 1
again 1
attempting 1
to 1
go 1
ahead 1
gave 1
the 1
nurse 1
time 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
taxicab 1
leaping 1
to 1
the 1
running 1
board 1
she 1
had 1
attempted 1
to 1
snatch 1
the 1
baby 1
from 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
and 1
here 1
screaming 1
and 1
fighting 1
she 1
had 1
clung 1
to 1
her 1
position 1
even 1
after 1
the 1
taxicab 1
had 1
got 1
under 1
way 1
nor 1
was 1
it 1
until 1
the 1
machine 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
greystoke 1
residence 1
at 1
good 1
speed 1
that 1
carl 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
blow 1
to 1
her 1
face 1
had 1
succeeded 1
in 1
knocking 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
pavement 1
her 1
screams 1
had 1
attracted 1
servants 1
and 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
families 1
from 1
residences 1
near 1
by 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
from 1
the 1
greystoke 1
home 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
had 1
witnessed 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
brave 1
battle 1
and 1
had 1
herself 1
tried 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
rapidly 1
passing 1
vehicle 1
but 1
had 1
been 1
too 1
late 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
anyone 1
knew 1
nor 1
did 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
dream 1
of 1
the 1
possible 1
identity 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
plot 1
until 1
her 1
husband 1
told 1
her 1
of 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
from 1
the 1
french 1
prison 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
hoped 1
he 1
was 1
permanently 1
confined 1
as 1
tarzan 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
stood 1
planning 1
the 1
wisest 1
course 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
telephone 1
bell 1
rang 1
in 1
the 1
library 1
at 1
their 1
right 1
tarzan 1
quickly 1
answered 1
the 1
call 1
in 1
person 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
asked 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
voice 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
line 1
yes 1
your 1
son 1
has 1
been 1
stolen 1
continued 1
the 1
voice 1
and 1
i 1
alone 1
may 1
help 1
you 1
to 1
recover 1
him 1
i 1
am 1
conversant 1
with 1
the 1
plot 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
took 1
him 1
in 1
fact 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
party 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
to 1
share 1
in 1
the 1
reward 1
but 1
now 1
they 1
are 1
trying 1
to 1
ditch 1
me 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
quits 1
with 1
them 1
i 1
will 1
aid 1
you 1
to 1
recover 1
him 1
on 1
condition 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
prosecute 1
me 1
for 1
my 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
crime 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
say 1
if 1
you 1
lead 1
me 1
to 1
where 1
my 1
son 1
is 1
hidden 1
replied 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
you 1
need 1
fear 1
nothing 1
from 1
me 1
good 1
replied 1
the 1
other 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
come 1
alone 1
to 1
meet 1
me 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
enough 1
that 1
i 1
must 1
trust 1
you 1
i 1
cannot 1
take 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
permitting 1
others 1
to 1
learn 1
my 1
identity 1
where 1
and 1
when 1
may 1
i 1
meet 1
you 1
asked 1
tarzan 1
the 1
other 1
gave 1
the 1
name 1
and 1
location 1
of 1
a 1
public 1
house 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
front 1
at 1
dover 1
a 1
place 1
frequented 1
by 1
sailors 1
come 1
he 1
concluded 1
about 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
tonight 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
no 1
good 1
to 1
arrive 1
earlier 1
your 1
son 1
will 1
be 1
safe 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
then 1
lead 1
you 1
secretly 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
is 1
hidden 1
but 1
be 1
sure 1
to 1
come 1
alone 1
and 1
under 1
no 1
circumstances 1
notify 1
scotland 1
yard 1
for 1
i 1
know 1
you 1
well 1
and 1
shall 1
be 1
watching 1
for 1
you 1
should 1
any 1
other 1
accompany 1
you 1
or 1
should 1
i 1
see 1
suspicious 1
characters 1
who 1
might 1
be 1
agents 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
i 1
shall 1
not 1
meet 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
last 1
chance 1
of 1
recovering 1
your 1
son 1
will 1
be 1
gone 1
without 1
more 1
words 1
the 1
man 1
rang 1
off 1
tarzan 1
repeated 1
the 1
gist 1
of 1
the 1
conversation 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
she 1
begged 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
accompany 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
insisted 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
result 1
in 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
carrying 1
out 1
his 1
threat 1
of 1
refusing 1
to 1
aid 1
them 1
if 1
tarzan 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
alone 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
parted 1
he 1
to 1
hasten 1
to 1
dover 1
and 1
she 1
ostensibly 1
to 1
wait 1
at 1
home 1
until 1
he 1
should 1
notify 1
her 1
of 1
the 1
outcome 1
of 1
his 1
mission 1
little 1
did 1
either 1
dream 1
of 1
what 1
both 1
were 1
destined 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
before 1
they 1
should 1
meet 1
again 1
or 1
the 1
far 1
distant 1
but 1
why 1
anticipate 1
for 1
ten 1
minutes 1
after 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
left 1
her 1
jane 1
clayton 1
walked 1
restlessly 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
across 1
the 1
silken 1
rugs 1
of 1
the 1
library 1
her 1
mother 1
heart 1
ached 1
bereft 1
of 1
its 1
first 1
born 1
her 1
mind 1
was 1
in 1
an 1
anguish 1
of 1
hopes 1
and 1
fears 1
though 1
her 1
judgment 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
all 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
were 1
her 1
tarzan 1
to 1
go 1
alone 1
in 1
accordance 1
with 1
the 1
mysterious 1
stranger 1
s 1
summons 1
her 1
intuition 1
would 1
not 1
permit 1
her 1
to 1
lay 1
aside 1
suspicion 1
of 1
the 1
gravest 1
dangers 1
to 1
both 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
her 1
son 1
the 1
more 1
she 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
the 1
more 1
convinced 1
she 1
became 1
that 1
the 1
recent 1
telephone 1
message 1
might 1
be 1
but 1
a 1
ruse 1
to 1
keep 1
them 1
inactive 1
until 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
safely 1
hidden 1
away 1
or 1
spirited 1
out 1
of 1
england 1
or 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
simply 1
a 1
bait 1
to 1
lure 1
tarzan 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
implacable 1
rokoff 1
with 1
the 1
lodgment 1
of 1
this 1
thought 1
she 1
stopped 1
in 1
wide 1
eyed 1
terror 1
instantly 1
it 1
became 1
a 1
conviction 1
she 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
clock 1
ticking 1
the 1
minutes 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
library 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
dover 1
train 1
that 1
tarzan 1
was 1
to 1
take 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
later 1
however 1
that 1
would 1
bring 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
channel 1
port 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
address 1
the 1
stranger 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
husband 1
before 1
the 1
appointed 1
hour 1
summoning 1
her 1
maid 1
and 1
chauffeur 1
she 1
issued 1
instructions 1
rapidly 1
ten 1
minutes 1
later 1
she 1
was 1
being 1
whisked 1
through 1
the 1
crowded 1
streets 1
toward 1
the 1
railway 1
station 1
it 1
was 1
nine 1
forty 1
five 1
that 1
night 1
that 1
tarzan 1
entered 1
the 1
squalid 1
pub 1
on 1
the 1
water 1
front 1
in 1
dover 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
evil 1
smelling 1
room 1
a 1
muffled 1
figure 1
brushed 1
past 1
him 1
toward 1
the 1
street 1
come 1
my 1
lord 1
whispered 1
the 1
stranger 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
wheeled 1
about 1
and 1
followed 1
the 1
other 1
into 1
the 1
ill 1
lit 1
alley 1
which 1
custom 1
had 1
dignified 1
with 1
the 1
title 1
of 1
thoroughfare 1
once 1
outside 1
the 1
fellow 1
led 1
the 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
nearer 1
a 1
wharf 1
where 1
high 1
piled 1
bales 1
boxes 1
and 1
casks 1
cast 1
dense 1
shadows 1
here 1
he 1
halted 1
where 1
is 1
the 1
boy 1
asked 1
greystoke 1
on 1
that 1
small 1
steamer 1
whose 1
lights 1
you 1
can 1
just 1
see 1
yonder 1
replied 1
the 1
other 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
tarzan 1
was 1
trying 1
to 1
peer 1
into 1
the 1
features 1
of 1
his 1
companion 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
recognize 1
the 1
man 1
as 1
one 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
before 1
seen 1
had 1
he 1
guessed 1
that 1
his 1
guide 1
was 1
alexis 1
paulvitch 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
realized 1
that 1
naught 1
but 1
treachery 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
heart 1
and 1
that 1
danger 1
lurked 1
in 1
the 1
path 1
of 1
every 1
move 1
he 1
is 1
unguarded 1
now 1
continued 1
the 1
russian 1
those 1
who 1
took 1
him 1
feel 1
perfectly 1
safe 1
from 1
detection 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
exception 1
of 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
crew 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
furnished 1
with 1
enough 1
gin 1
to 1
silence 1
them 1
effectually 1
for 1
hours 1
there 1
is 1
none 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
we 1
can 1
go 1
aboard 1
get 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
return 1
without 1
the 1
slightest 1
fear 1
tarzan 1
nodded 1
let 1
s 1
be 1
about 1
it 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
his 1
guide 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
boat 1
moored 1
alongside 1
the 1
wharf 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
entered 1
and 1
paulvitch 1
pulled 1
rapidly 1
toward 1
the 1
steamer 1
the 1
black 1
smoke 1
issuing 1
from 1
her 1
funnel 1
did 1
not 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
make 1
any 1
suggestion 1
to 1
tarzan 1
s 1
mind 1
all 1
his 1
thoughts 1
were 1
occupied 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
he 1
would 1
again 1
have 1
his 1
little 1
son 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
at 1
the 1
steamer 1
s 1
side 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
monkey 1
ladder 1
dangling 1
close 1
above 1
them 1
and 1
up 1
this 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
crept 1
stealthily 1
once 1
on 1
deck 1
they 1
hastened 1
aft 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
russian 1
pointed 1
to 1
a 1
hatch 1
the 1
boy 1
is 1
hidden 1
there 1
he 1
said 1
you 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
down 1
after 1
him 1
as 1
there 1
is 1
less 1
chance 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
cry 1
in 1
fright 1
than 1
should 1
he 1
find 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
a 1
stranger 1
i 1
will 1
stand 1
on 1
guard 1
here 1
so 1
anxious 1
was 1
tarzan 1
to 1
rescue 1
the 1
child 1
that 1
he 1
gave 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
thought 1
to 1
the 1
strangeness 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
conditions 1
surrounding 1
the 1
kincaid 1
that 1
her 1
deck 1
was 1
deserted 1
though 1
she 1
had 1
steam 1
up 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
volume 1
of 1
smoke 1
pouring 1
from 1
her 1
funnel 1
was 1
all 1
ready 1
to 1
get 1
under 1
way 1
made 1
no 1
impression 1
upon 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
in 1
another 1
instant 1
he 1
would 1
fold 1
that 1
precious 1
little 1
bundle 1
of 1
humanity 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
swung 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
below 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
released 1
his 1
hold 1
upon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
hatch 1
than 1
the 1
heavy 1
covering 1
fell 1
clattering 1
above 1
him 1
instantly 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
a 1
plot 1
and 1
that 1
far 1
from 1
rescuing 1
his 1
son 1
he 1
had 1
himself 1
fallen 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
his 1
enemies 1
though 1
he 1
immediately 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
hatch 1
and 1
lift 1
the 1
cover 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
striking 1
a 1
match 1
he 1
explored 1
his 1
surroundings 1
finding 1
that 1
a 1
little 1
compartment 1
had 1
been 1
partitioned 1
off 1
from 1
the 1
main 1
hold 1
with 1
the 1
hatch 1
above 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
only 1
means 1
of 1
ingress 1
or 1
egress 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
the 1
room 1
had 1
been 1
prepared 1
for 1
the 1
very 1
purpose 1
of 1
serving 1
as 1
a 1
cell 1
for 1
himself 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
compartment 1
and 1
no 1
other 1
occupant 1
if 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
on 1
board 1
the 1
kincaid 1
he 1
was 1
confined 1
elsewhere 1
for 1
over 1
twenty 1
years 1
from 1
infancy 1
to 1
manhood 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
roamed 1
his 1
savage 1
jungle 1
haunts 1
without 1
human 1
companionship 1
of 1
any 1
nature 1
he 1
had 1
learned 1
at 1
the 1
most 1
impressionable 1
period 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
pleasures 1
and 1
his 1
sorrows 1
as 1
the 1
beasts 1
take 1
theirs 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
neither 1
raved 1
nor 1
stormed 1
against 1
fate 1
but 1
instead 1
waited 1
patiently 1
for 1
what 1
might 1
next 1
befall 1
him 1
though 1
not 1
by 1
any 1
means 1
without 1
an 1
eye 1
to 1
doing 1
the 1
utmost 1
to 1
succour 1
himself 1
to 1
this 1
end 1
he 1
examined 1
his 1
prison 1
carefully 1
tested 1
the 1
heavy 1
planking 1
that 1
formed 1
its 1
walls 1
and 1
measured 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
the 1
hatch 1
above 1
him 1
and 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
thus 1
occupied 1
there 1
came 1
suddenly 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
vibration 1
of 1
machinery 1
and 1
the 1
throbbing 1
of 1
the 1
propeller 1
the 1
ship 1
was 1
moving 1
where 1
to 1
and 1
to 1
what 1
fate 1
was 1
it 1
carrying 1
him 1
and 1
even 1
as 1
these 1
thoughts 1
passed 1
through 1
his 1
mind 1
there 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
ears 1
above 1
the 1
din 1
of 1
the 1
engines 1
that 1
which 1
caused 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
cold 1
with 1
apprehension 1
clear 1
and 1
shrill 1
from 1
the 1
deck 1
above 1
him 1
rang 1
the 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
frightened 1
woman 1
chapter 1
2 1
marooned 1
as 1
tarzan 1
and 1
his 1
guide 1
had 1
disappeared 1
into 1
the 1
shadows 1
upon 1
the 1
dark 1
wharf 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
heavily 1
veiled 1
woman 1
had 1
hurried 1
down 1
the 1
narrow 1
alley 1
to 1
the 1
entrance 1
of 1
the 1
drinking 1
place 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
had 1
just 1
quitted 1
here 1
she 1
paused 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
though 1
satisfied 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
at 1
last 1
reached 1
the 1
place 1
she 1
sought 1
she 1
pushed 1
bravely 1
into 1
the 1
interior 1
of 1
the 1
vile 1
den 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
half 1
drunken 1
sailors 1
and 1
wharf 1
rats 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
unaccustomed 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
richly 1
gowned 1
woman 1
in 1
their 1
midst 1
rapidly 1
she 1
approached 1
the 1
slovenly 1
barmaid 1
who 1
stared 1
half 1
in 1
envy 1
half 1
in 1
hate 1
at 1
her 1
more 1
fortunate 1
sister 1
have 1
you 1
seen 1
a 1
tall 1
well 1
dressed 1
man 1
here 1
but 1
a 1
minute 1
since 1
she 1
asked 1
who 1
met 1
another 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
girl 1
answered 1
in 1
the 1
affirmative 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
which 1
way 1
the 1
two 1
had 1
gone 1
a 1
sailor 1
who 1
had 1
approached 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
the 1
conversation 1
vouchsafed 1
the 1
information 1
that 1
a 1
moment 1
before 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
about 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
pub 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
two 1
men 1
leaving 1
it 1
who 1
walked 1
toward 1
the 1
wharf 1
show 1
me 1
the 1
direction 1
they 1
went 1
cried 1
the 1
woman 1
slipping 1
a 1
coin 1
into 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
hand 1
the 1
fellow 1
led 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
together 1
they 1
walked 1
quickly 1
toward 1
the 1
wharf 1
and 1
along 1
it 1
until 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
small 1
boat 1
just 1
pulling 1
into 1
the 1
shadows 1
of 1
a 1
near 1
by 1
steamer 1
there 1
they 1
be 1
whispered 1
the 1
man 1
ten 1
pounds 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
boat 1
and 1
row 1
me 1
to 1
that 1
steamer 1
cried 1
the 1
woman 1
quick 1
then 1
he 1
replied 1
for 1
we 1
gotta 1
go 1
it 1
if 1
we 1
re 1
goin 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
kincaid 1
afore 1
she 1
sails 1
she 1
s 1
had 1
steam 1
up 1
for 1
three 1
hours 1
an 1
jest 1
been 1
a 1
waitin 1
fer 1
that 1
one 1
passenger 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
talkin 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
crew 1
arf 1
an 1
hour 1
ago 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
he 1
led 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
wharf 1
where 1
he 1
knew 1
another 1
boat 1
lay 1
moored 1
and 1
lowering 1
the 1
woman 1
into 1
it 1
he 1
jumped 1
in 1
after 1
and 1
pushed 1
off 1
the 1
two 1
were 1
soon 1
scudding 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
at 1
the 1
steamer 1
s 1
side 1
the 1
man 1
demanded 1
his 1
pay 1
and 1
without 1
waiting 1
to 1
count 1
out 1
the 1
exact 1
amount 1
the 1
woman 1
thrust 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
bank 1
notes 1
into 1
his 1
outstretched 1
hand 1
a 1
single 1
glance 1
at 1
them 1
convinced 1
the 1
fellow 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
well 1
paid 1
then 1
he 1
assisted 1
her 1
up 1
the 1
ladder 1
holding 1
his 1
skiff 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
side 1
against 1
the 1
chance 1
that 1
this 1
profitable 1
passenger 1
might 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
taken 1
ashore 1
later 1
but 1
presently 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
donkey 1
engine 1
and 1
the 1
rattle 1
of 1
a 1
steel 1
cable 1
on 1
the 1
hoisting 1
drum 1
proclaimed 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
anchor 1
was 1
being 1
raised 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
waiter 1
heard 1
the 1
propellers 1
revolving 1
and 1
slowly 1
the 1
little 1
steamer 1
moved 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
channel 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
row 1
back 1
to 1
shore 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
shriek 1
from 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
deck 1
that 1
s 1
wot 1
i 1
calls 1
rotten 1
luck 1
he 1
soliloquized 1
i 1
might 1
jest 1
as 1
well 1
of 1
ad 1
the 1
whole 1
bloomin 1
wad 1
when 1
jane 1
clayton 1
climbed 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
ship 1
apparently 1
deserted 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
those 1
she 1
sought 1
nor 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
aboard 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
went 1
about 1
her 1
search 1
for 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
she 1
hoped 1
against 1
hope 1
to 1
find 1
there 1
without 1
interruption 1
quickly 1
she 1
hastened 1
to 1
the 1
cabin 1
which 1
was 1
half 1
above 1
and 1
half 1
below 1
deck 1
as 1
she 1
hurried 1
down 1
the 1
short 1
companion 1
ladder 1
into 1
the 1
main 1
cabin 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
the 1
smaller 1
rooms 1
occupied 1
by 1
the 1
officers 1
she 1
failed 1
to 1
note 1
the 1
quick 1
closing 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
doors 1
before 1
her 1
she 1
passed 1
the 1
full 1
length 1
of 1
the 1
main 1
room 1
and 1
then 1
retracing 1
her 1
steps 1
stopped 1
before 1
each 1
door 1
to 1
listen 1
furtively 1
trying 1
each 1
latch 1
all 1
was 1
silence 1
utter 1
silence 1
there 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
throbbing 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
frightened 1
heart 1
seemed 1
to 1
her 1
overwrought 1
imagination 1
to 1
fill 1
the 1
ship 1
with 1
its 1
thunderous 1
alarm 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
the 1
doors 1
opened 1
before 1
her 1
touch 1
only 1
to 1
reveal 1
empty 1
interiors 1
in 1
her 1
absorption 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
note 1
the 1
sudden 1
activity 1
upon 1
the 1
vessel 1
the 1
purring 1
of 1
the 1
engines 1
the 1
throbbing 1
of 1
the 1
propeller 1
she 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
last 1
door 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
now 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
pushed 1
it 1
open 1
she 1
was 1
seized 1
from 1
within 1
by 1
a 1
powerful 1
dark 1
visaged 1
man 1
and 1
drawn 1
hastily 1
into 1
the 1
stuffy 1
ill 1
smelling 1
interior 1
the 1
sudden 1
shock 1
of 1
fright 1
which 1
the 1
unexpected 1
attack 1
had 1
upon 1
her 1
drew 1
a 1
single 1
piercing 1
scream 1
from 1
her 1
throat 1
then 1
the 1
man 1
clapped 1
a 1
hand 1
roughly 1
over 1
the 1
mouth 1
not 1
until 1
we 1
are 1
farther 1
from 1
land 1
my 1
dear 1
he 1
said 1
then 1
you 1
may 1
yell 1
your 1
pretty 1
head 1
off 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
turned 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
the 1
leering 1
bearded 1
face 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
hers 1
the 1
man 1
relaxed 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
his 1
fingers 1
upon 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
moan 1
of 1
terror 1
as 1
she 1
recognized 1
him 1
the 1
girl 1
shrank 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
captor 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
m 1
thuran 1
she 1
exclaimed 1
your 1
devoted 1
admirer 1
replied 1
the 1
russian 1
with 1
a 1
low 1
bow 1
my 1
little 1
boy 1
she 1
said 1
next 1
ignoring 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
endearment 1
where 1
is 1
he 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
him 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
be 1
so 1
cruel 1
even 1
as 1
you 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
cannot 1
be 1
entirely 1
devoid 1
of 1
mercy 1
and 1
compassion 1
tell 1
me 1
where 1
he 1
is 1
is 1
he 1
aboard 1
this 1
ship 1
oh 1
please 1
if 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
heart 1
beats 1
within 1
your 1
breast 1
take 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
baby 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
bid 1
no 1
harm 1
will 1
befall 1
him 1
replied 1
rokoff 1
but 1
remember 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
fault 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
here 1
you 1
came 1
aboard 1
voluntarily 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
take 1
the 1
consequences 1
i 1
little 1
thought 1
he 1
added 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
any 1
such 1
good 1
luck 1
as 1
this 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
he 1
went 1
on 1
deck 1
then 1
locking 1
the 1
cabin 1
door 1
upon 1
his 1
prisoner 1
and 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
him 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
being 1
that 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
was 1
so 1
poor 1
a 1
sailor 1
that 1
the 1
heavy 1
seas 1
the 1
kincaid 1
encountered 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
beginning 1
of 1
her 1
voyage 1
sent 1
the 1
russian 1
to 1
his 1
berth 1
with 1
a 1
bad 1
attack 1
of 1
sea 1
sickness 1
during 1
this 1
time 1
her 1
only 1
visitor 1
was 1
an 1
uncouth 1
swede 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
unsavoury 1
cook 1
who 1
brought 1
her 1
meals 1
to 1
her 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
sven 1
anderssen 1
his 1
one 1
pride 1
being 1
that 1
his 1
patronymic 1
was 1
spelt 1
with 1
a 1
double 1
s 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
tall 1
and 1
raw 1
boned 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
yellow 1
moustache 1
an 1
unwholesome 1
complexion 1
and 1
filthy 1
nails 1
the 1
very 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
with 1
one 1
grimy 1
thumb 1
buried 1
deep 1
in 1
the 1
lukewarm 1
stew 1
that 1
seemed 1
from 1
the 1
frequency 1
of 1
its 1
repetition 1
to 1
constitute 1
the 1
pride 1
of 1
his 1
culinary 1
art 1
was 1
sufficient 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
appetite 1
his 1
small 1
blue 1
close 1
set 1
eyes 1
never 1
met 1
hers 1
squarely 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
shiftiness 1
of 1
his 1
whole 1
appearance 1
that 1
even 1
found 1
expression 1
in 1
the 1
cat 1
like 1
manner 1
of 1
his 1
gait 1
and 1
to 1
it 1
all 1
a 1
sinister 1
suggestion 1
was 1
added 1
by 1
the 1
long 1
slim 1
knife 1
that 1
always 1
rested 1
at 1
his 1
waist 1
slipped 1
through 1
the 1
greasy 1
cord 1
that 1
supported 1
his 1
soiled 1
apron 1
ostensibly 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
an 1
implement 1
of 1
his 1
calling 1
but 1
the 1
girl 1
could 1
never 1
free 1
herself 1
of 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
require 1
less 1
provocation 1
to 1
witness 1
it 1
put 1
to 1
other 1
and 1
less 1
harmless 1
uses 1
his 1
manner 1
toward 1
her 1
was 1
surly 1
yet 1
she 1
never 1
failed 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
pleasant 1
smile 1
and 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
thanks 1
when 1
he 1
brought 1
her 1
food 1
to 1
her 1
though 1
more 1
often 1
than 1
not 1
she 1
hurled 1
the 1
bulk 1
of 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
tiny 1
cabin 1
port 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
closed 1
behind 1
him 1
during 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
anguish 1
that 1
followed 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
imprisonment 1
but 1
two 1
questions 1
were 1
uppermost 1
in 1
her 1
mind 1
the 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
her 1
son 1
she 1
fully 1
believed 1
that 1
the 1
baby 1
was 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
provided 1
that 1
he 1
still 1
lived 1
but 1
whether 1
tarzan 1
had 1
been 1
permitted 1
to 1
live 1
after 1
having 1
been 1
lured 1
aboard 1
the 1
evil 1
craft 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
guess 1
she 1
knew 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
deep 1
hatred 1
that 1
the 1
russian 1
felt 1
for 1
the 1
englishman 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
but 1
one 1
reason 1
for 1
having 1
him 1
brought 1
aboard 1
the 1
ship 1
to 1
dispatch 1
him 1
in 1
comparative 1
safety 1
in 1
revenge 1
for 1
his 1
having 1
thwarted 1
rokoff 1
s 1
pet 1
schemes 1
and 1
for 1
having 1
been 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
landing 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
french 1
prison 1
tarzan 1
on 1
his 1
part 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
his 1
cell 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
was 1
a 1
prisoner 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
almost 1
above 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
same 1
swede 1
that 1
served 1
jane 1
brought 1
his 1
meals 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
though 1
on 1
several 1
occasions 1
tarzan 1
had 1
tried 1
to 1
draw 1
the 1
man 1
into 1
conversation 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
unsuccessful 1
he 1
had 1
hoped 1
to 1
learn 1
through 1
this 1
fellow 1
whether 1
his 1
little 1
son 1
was 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
but 1
to 1
every 1
question 1
upon 1
this 1
or 1
kindred 1
subjects 1
the 1
fellow 1
returned 1
but 1
one 1
reply 1
ay 1
tank 1
it 1
blow 1
purty 1
soon 1
purty 1
hard 1
so 1
after 1
several 1
attempts 1
tarzan 1
gave 1
it 1
up 1
for 1
weeks 1
that 1
seemed 1
months 1
to 1
the 1
two 1
prisoners 1
the 1
little 1
steamer 1
forged 1
on 1
they 1
knew 1
not 1
where 1
once 1
the 1
kincaid 1
stopped 1
to 1
coal 1
only 1
immediately 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
the 1
seemingly 1
interminable 1
voyage 1
rokoff 1
had 1
visited 1
jane 1
clayton 1
but 1
once 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
locked 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
tiny 1
cabin 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
gaunt 1
and 1
hollow 1
eyed 1
from 1
a 1
long 1
siege 1
of 1
sea 1
sickness 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
his 1
visit 1
was 1
to 1
obtain 1
from 1
her 1
her 1
personal 1
cheque 1
for 1
a 1
large 1
sum 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
a 1
guarantee 1
of 1
her 1
personal 1
safety 1
and 1
return 1
to 1
england 1
when 1
you 1
set 1
me 1
down 1
safely 1
in 1
any 1
civilized 1
port 1
together 1
with 1
my 1
son 1
and 1
my 1
husband 1
she 1
replied 1
i 1
will 1
pay 1
you 1
in 1
gold 1
twice 1
the 1
amount 1
you 1
ask 1
but 1
until 1
then 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
cent 1
nor 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
a 1
cent 1
under 1
any 1
other 1
conditions 1
you 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
cheque 1
i 1
ask 1
he 1
replied 1
with 1
a 1
snarl 1
or 1
neither 1
you 1
nor 1
your 1
child 1
nor 1
your 1
husband 1
will 1
ever 1
again 1
set 1
foot 1
within 1
any 1
port 1
civilized 1
or 1
otherwise 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
trust 1
you 1
she 1
replied 1
what 1
guarantee 1
have 1
i 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
take 1
my 1
money 1
and 1
then 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
pleased 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
mine 1
regardless 1
of 1
your 1
promise 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
as 1
i 1
bid 1
he 1
said 1
turning 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
cabin 1
remember 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
your 1
son 1
if 1
you 1
chance 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
agonized 1
wail 1
of 1
a 1
tortured 1
child 1
it 1
may 1
console 1
you 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
of 1
your 1
stubbornness 1
that 1
the 1
baby 1
suffers 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
baby 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
cried 1
the 1
girl 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
so 1
fiendishly 1
cruel 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
i 1
that 1
am 1
cruel 1
but 1
you 1
he 1
returned 1
for 1
you 1
permit 1
a 1
paltry 1
sum 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
stand 1
between 1
your 1
baby 1
and 1
immunity 1
from 1
suffering 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
jane 1
clayton 1
wrote 1
out 1
a 1
cheque 1
of 1
large 1
denomination 1
and 1
handed 1
it 1
to 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
who 1
left 1
her 1
cabin 1
with 1
a 1
grin 1
of 1
satisfaction 1
upon 1
his 1
lips 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
the 1
hatch 1
was 1
removed 1
from 1
tarzan 1
s 1
cell 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
up 1
he 1
saw 1
paulvitch 1
s 1
head 1
framed 1
in 1
the 1
square 1
of 1
light 1
above 1
him 1
come 1
up 1
commanded 1
the 1
russian 1
but 1
bear 1
in 1
mind 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
shot 1
if 1
you 1
make 1
a 1
single 1
move 1
to 1
attack 1
me 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
aboard 1
the 1
ship 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
swung 1
himself 1
lightly 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
about 1
him 1
but 1
at 1
a 1
respectful 1
distance 1
stood 1
a 1
half 1
dozen 1
sailors 1
armed 1
with 1
rifles 1
and 1
revolvers 1
facing 1
him 1
was 1
paulvitch 1
tarzan 1
looked 1
about 1
for 1
rokoff 1
who 1
he 1
felt 1
sure 1
must 1
be 1
aboard 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
him 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
commenced 1
the 1
russian 1
by 1
your 1
continued 1
and 1
wanton 1
interference 1
with 1
m 1
rokoff 1
and 1
his 1
plans 1
you 1
have 1
at 1
last 1
brought 1
yourself 1
and 1
your 1
family 1
to 1
this 1
unfortunate 1
extremity 1
you 1
have 1
only 1
yourself 1
to 1
thank 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
it 1
has 1
cost 1
m 1
rokoff 1
a 1
large 1
amount 1
of 1
money 1
to 1
finance 1
this 1
expedition 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
sole 1
cause 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
naturally 1
looks 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
reimbursement 1
further 1
i 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
only 1
by 1
meeting 1
m 1
rokoff 1
s 1
just 1
demands 1
may 1
you 1
avert 1
the 1
most 1
unpleasant 1
consequences 1
to 1
your 1
wife 1
and 1
child 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
retain 1
your 1
own 1
life 1
and 1
regain 1
your 1
liberty 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
amount 1
asked 1
tarzan 1
and 1
what 1
assurance 1
have 1
i 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
live 1
up 1
to 1
your 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
agreement 1
i 1
have 1
little 1
reason 1
to 1
trust 1
two 1
such 1
scoundrels 1
as 1
you 1
and 1
rokoff 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
russian 1
flushed 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
no 1
position 1
to 1
deliver 1
insults 1
he 1
said 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
assurance 1
that 1
we 1
will 1
live 1
up 1
to 1
our 1
agreement 1
other 1
than 1
my 1
word 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
before 1
you 1
the 1
assurance 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
make 1
short 1
work 1
of 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
write 1
out 1
the 1
cheque 1
we 1
demand 1
unless 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
greater 1
fool 1
than 1
i 1
imagine 1
you 1
should 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
that 1
would 1
give 1
us 1
greater 1
pleasure 1
than 1
to 1
order 1
these 1
men 1
to 1
fire 1
that 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
is 1
because 1
we 1
have 1
other 1
plans 1
for 1
punishing 1
you 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
entirely 1
upset 1
by 1
your 1
death 1
answer 1
one 1
question 1
said 1
tarzan 1
is 1
my 1
son 1
on 1
board 1
this 1
ship 1
no 1
replied 1
alexis 1
paulvitch 1
your 1
son 1
is 1
quite 1
safe 1
elsewhere 1
nor 1
will 1
he 1
be 1
killed 1
until 1
you 1
refuse 1
to 1
accede 1
to 1
our 1
fair 1
demands 1
if 1
it 1
becomes 1
necessary 1
to 1
kill 1
you 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
no 1
reason 1
for 1
not 1
killing 1
the 1
child 1
since 1
with 1
you 1
gone 1
the 1
one 1
whom 1
we 1
wish 1
to 1
punish 1
through 1
the 1
boy 1
will 1
be 1
gone 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
then 1
be 1
to 1
us 1
only 1
a 1
constant 1
source 1
of 1
danger 1
and 1
embarrassment 1

therefore 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
only 1
save 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
your 1
son 1
by 1
saving 1
your 1
own 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
only 1
save 1
your 1
own 1
by 1
giving 1
us 1
the 1
cheque 1
we 1
ask 1
very 1
well 1
replied 1
tarzan 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
trust 1
them 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
any 1
sinister 1
threat 1
that 1
paulvitch 1
had 1
made 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
bare 1
chance 1
that 1
by 1
conceding 1
their 1
demands 1
he 1
might 1
save 1
the 1
boy 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
live 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
appended 1
his 1
name 1
to 1
the 1
cheque 1
never 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
being 1
within 1
the 1
realms 1
of 1
probability 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
such 1
a 1
battle 1
as 1
they 1
would 1
never 1
forget 1
and 1
possibly 1
to 1
take 1
paulvitch 1
with 1
him 1
into 1
eternity 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
sorry 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
rokoff 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
pocket 1
cheque 1
book 1
and 1
fountain 1
pen 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
amount 1
he 1
asked 1
paulvitch 1
named 1
an 1
enormous 1
sum 1
tarzan 1
could 1
scarce 1
restrain 1
a 1
smile 1
their 1
very 1
cupidity 1
was 1
to 1
prove 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
their 1
undoing 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
the 1
ransom 1
at 1
least 1
purposely 1
he 1
hesitated 1
and 1
haggled 1
over 1
the 1
amount 1
but 1
paulvitch 1
was 1
obdurate 1
finally 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
wrote 1
out 1
his 1
cheque 1
for 1
a 1
larger 1
sum 1
than 1
stood 1
to 1
his 1
credit 1
at 1
the 1
bank 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
hand 1
the 1
worthless 1
slip 1
of 1
paper 1
to 1
the 1
russian 1

glance 1
chanced 1
to 1
pass 1
across 1
the 1
starboard 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
to 1
his 1
surprise 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
ship 1
lay 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
hundred 1
yards 1
of 1
land 1
almost 1
down 1
to 1
the 1

ran 1
a 1
dense 1
tropical 1
jungle 1
and 1
behind 1
was 1
higher 1
land 1
clothed 1
in 1
forest 1
paulvitch 1
noted 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
his 1
gaze 1

are 1
to 1
be 1
set 1
at 1

for 1
immediate 1
physical 1
revenge 1
upon 1

he 1
thought 1
the 1

before 1
him 1
the 1
mainland 1
of 1
africa 1
and 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
should 1
they 1
liberate 1
him 1
here 1
he 1
could 1
doubtless 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
civilization 1
with 1
comparative 1
ease 1
paulvitch 1
took 1
the 1
cheque 1
remove 1
your 1
clothing 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
here 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
need 1
it 1
tarzan 1
demurred 1
paulvitch 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
armed 1
sailors 1
then 1
the 1
englishman 1
slowly 1
divested 1
himself 1
of 1
his 1
clothing 1
a 1
boat 1
was 1
lowered 1
and 1
still 1
heavily 1
guarded 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
was 1
rowed 1
ashore 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
later 1
the 1
sailors 1
had 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
kincaid 1
and 1
the 1
steamer 1
was 1
slowly 1
getting 1
under 1
way 1
as 1
tarzan 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
narrow 1
strip 1
of 1
beach 1
watching 1
the 1
departure 1
of 1
the 1
vessel 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
figure 1
appear 1
at 1
the 1
rail 1
and 1
call 1
aloud 1
to 1
attract 1
his 1
attention 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
been 1
about 1
to 1
read 1
a 1
note 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
sailors 1
had 1
handed 1
him 1
as 1
the 1
small 1
boat 1
that 1
bore 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
returning 1
to 1
the 1
steamer 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
hail 1
from 1
the 1
vessel 1
s 1
deck 1
he 1
looked 1
up 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
black 1
bearded 1
man 1
who 1
laughed 1
at 1
him 1
in 1
derision 1
as 1
he 1
held 1
high 1
above 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
tarzan 1
half 1
started 1
as 1
though 1
to 1
rush 1
through 1
the 1
surf 1
and 1
strike 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
already 1
moving 1
steamer 1
but 1
realizing 1
the 1
futility 1
of 1
so 1
rash 1
an 1
act 1
he 1
halted 1
at 1
the 1
water 1
s 1
edge 1
thus 1
he 1
stood 1
his 1
gaze 1
riveted 1
upon 1
the 1
kincaid 1
until 1
it 1
disappeared 1
beyond 1
a 1
projecting 1
promontory 1
of 1
the 1
coast 1
from 1
the 1
jungle 1
at 1
his 1
back 1
fierce 1
bloodshot 1
eyes 1
glared 1
from 1
beneath 1
shaggy 1
overhanging 1
brows 1
upon 1
him 1
little 1
monkeys 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
tops 1
chattered 1
and 1
scolded 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
the 1
inland 1
forest 1
came 1
the 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
leopard 1
but 1
still 1
john 1
clayton 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
stood 1
deaf 1
and 1
unseeing 1
suffering 1
the 1
pangs 1
of 1
keen 1
regret 1
for 1
the 1
opportunity 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
wasted 1
because 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
gullible 1
as 1

the 1

had 1

watching 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
cat 1

was 1
creeping 1
stealthily 1
toward 1

unfolded 1
the 1

thrust 1
into 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
read 1
it 1

first 1
it 1
made 1
little 1

on 1

finally 1
the 1
full 1
purport 1
of 1
the 1
hideous 1
plot 1
of 1
revenge 1
unfolded 1
itself 1

leave 1
to 1

as 1
he 1
finished 1
reading 1
a 1
slight 1
sound 1
behind 1
him 1
brought 1
him 1
back 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
of 1
present 1
realities 1
instantly 1
his 1
senses 1
awoke 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
again 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
as 1
he 1
wheeled 1
about 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
beast 1
at 1
bay 1
vibrant 1
with 1
the 1
instinct 1
of 1
self 1
preservation 1
that 1
faced 1
a 1
huge 1
bull 1
ape 1
that 1
was 1
already 1
charging 1
down 1
upon 1
him 1
the 1
two 1
years 1
that 1
had 1
elapsed 1
since 1
tarzan 1
had 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
forest 1
with 1
his 1
rescued 1
mate 1
had 1
witnessed 1
slight 1
diminution 1
of 1
the 1
mighty 1
powers 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
the 1
invincible 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
his 1
great 1
estates 1
in 1
uziri 1
had 1
claimed 1
much 1
of 1
his 1
time 1
and 1
attention 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
ample 1
field 1
for 1
the 1
practical 1
use 1
and 1
retention 1
of 1
his 1
almost 1
superhuman 1
powers 1
but 1
naked 1
and 1
unarmed 1
to 1
do 1
battle 1
with 1
the 1
shaggy 1
bull 1
necked 1
beast 1
that 1
now 1
confronted 1
him 1
was 1
a 1
test 1
that 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
would 1
scarce 1
have 1
welcomed 1
at 1
any 1
period 1
of 1
his 1
wild 1
existence 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
alternative 1
other 1
than 1
to 1
meet 1
the 1
rage 1
maddened 1
creature 1
with 1
the 1
weapons 1
with 1
which 1
nature 1
had 1
endowed 1
him 1
over 1
the 1
bull 1
s 1
shoulder 1
tarzan 1
could 1
see 1
now 1
the 1
heads 1
and 1
shoulders 1
of 1
perhaps 1
a 1
dozen 1
more 1
of 1
these 1
mighty 1
fore 1
runners 1
of 1
primitive 1
man 1
he 1
knew 1
however 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
little 1
chance 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
attack 1
him 1
since 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
within 1
the 1
reasoning 1
powers 1
of 1
the 1
anthropoid 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
weigh 1
or 1
appreciate 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
concentrated 1
action 1
against 1
an 1
enemy 1
otherwise 1
they 1
would 1
long 1
since 1
have 1
become 1
the 1
dominant 1
creatures 1
of 1
their 1
haunts 1
so 1
tremendous 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
destruction 1
lies 1
in 1
their 1
mighty 1
thews 1
and 1
savage 1
fangs 1
with 1
a 1
low 1
snarl 1
the 1
beast 1
now 1
hurled 1
himself 1
at 1
tarzan 1
but 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
found 1
among 1
other 1
things 1
in 1
the 1
haunts 1
of 1
civilized 1
man 1
certain 1
methods 1
of 1
scientific 1
warfare 1
that 1
are 1
unknown 1
to 1
the 1
jungle 1
folk 1
whereas 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
since 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
met 1
the 1
brute 1
rush 1
with 1
brute 1
force 1
he 1
now 1
sidestepped 1
his 1
antagonist 1
s 1
headlong 1
charge 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
brute 1
hurtled 1
past 1
him 1
swung 1
a 1
mighty 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
pit 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
s 1
stomach 1
with 1
a 1
howl 1
of 1
mingled 1
rage 1
and 1
anguish 1
the 1
great 1
anthropoid 1
bent 1
double 1
and 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
though 1
almost 1
instantly 1
he 1
was 1
again 1
struggling 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
regain 1
them 1
however 1
his 1
white 1
skinned 1
foe 1
had 1
wheeled 1
and 1
pounced 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
there 1
dropped 1
from 1
the 1
shoulders 1
of 1
the 1
english 1
lord 1
the 1
last 1
shred 1
of 1
his 1
superficial 1
mantle 1
of 1
civilization 1
once 1
again 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
jungle 1
beast 1
revelling 1
in 1
bloody 1
conflict 1
with 1
his 1
kind 1
once 1
again 1
he 1
was 1
tarzan 1
son 1
of 1
kala 1
the 1
she 1
ape 1
his 1
strong 1
white 1
teeth 1
sank 1
into 1
the 1
hairy 1
throat 1
of 1
his 1
enemy 1
as 1
he 1
sought 1
the 1
pulsing 1
jugular 1
powerful 1
fingers 1
held 1
the 1
mighty 1
fangs 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
flesh 1
or 1
clenched 1
and 1
beat 1
with 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
a 1
steam 1
hammer 1
upon 1
the 1
snarling 1
foam 1
flecked 1
face 1
of 1
his 1
adversary 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
about 1
them 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
apes 1
stood 1
watching 1
and 1
enjoying 1
the 1
struggle 1
they 1
muttered 1
low 1
gutturals 1
of 1
approval 1
as 1
bits 1
of 1
white 1
hide 1
or 1
hairy 1
bloodstained 1
skin 1
were 1
torn 1
from 1
one 1
contestant 1
or 1
the 1
other 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
silent 1
in 1
amazement 1
and 1
expectation 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
mighty 1
white 1
ape 1
wriggle 1
upon 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
their 1
king 1
and 1
with 1
steel 1
muscles 1
tensed 1
beneath 1
the 1
armpits 1
of 1
his 1
antagonist 1
bear 1
down 1
mightily 1
with 1
his 1
open 1
palms 1
upon 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
thick 1
bullneck 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
king 1
ape 1
could 1
but 1
shriek 1
in 1
agony 1
and 1
flounder 1
helplessly 1
about 1
upon 1
the 1
thick 1
mat 1
of 1
jungle 1
grass 1
as 1
tarzan 1
had 1
overcome 1
the 1
huge 1
terkoz 1
that 1
time 1
years 1
before 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
about 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
upon 1
his 1
quest 1
for 1
human 1
beings 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
kind 1
and 1
colour 1
so 1
now 1
he 1
overcame 1
this 1
other 1
great 1
ape 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
wrestling 1
hold 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
stumbled 1
by 1
accident 1
during 1
that 1
other 1
combat 1
the 1
little 1
audience 1
of 1
fierce 1
anthropoids 1
heard 1
the 1
creaking 1
of 1
their 1
king 1
s 1
neck 1
mingling 1
with 1
his 1
agonized 1
shrieks 1
and 1
hideous 1
roaring 1
then 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
sudden 1
crack 1
like 1
the 1
breaking 1
of 1
a 1
stout 1
limb 1
before 1
the 1
fury 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
the 1
bullet 1
head 1
crumpled 1
forward 1
upon 1
its 1
flaccid 1
neck 1
against 1
the 1
great 1
hairy 1
chest 1
the 1
roaring 1
and 1
the 1
shrieking 1
ceased 1
the 1
little 1
pig 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
onlookers 1
wandered 1
from 1
the 1
still 1
form 1
of 1
their 1
leader 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
ape 1
that 1
was 1
rising 1
to 1
its 1
feet 1
beside 1
the 1
vanquished 1
then 1
back 1
to 1
their 1
king 1
as 1
though 1
in 1
wonder 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
arise 1
and 1
slay 1
this 1
presumptuous 1
stranger 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
new 1
comer 1
place 1
a 1
foot 1
upon 1
the 1
neck 1
of 1
the 1
quiet 1
figure 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
throwing 1
back 1
his 1
head 1
give 1
vent 1
to 1
the 1
wild 1
uncanny 1
challenge 1
of 1
the 1
bull 1
ape 1
that 1
has 1
made 1
a 1
kill 1
then 1
they 1
knew 1
that 1
their 1
king 1
was 1
dead 1
across 1
the 1
jungle 1
rolled 1
the 1
horrid 1
notes 1
of 1
the 1
victory 1
cry 1
the 1
little 1
monkeys 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
tops 1
ceased 1
their 1
chattering 1
the 1
harsh 1
voiced 1
brilliant 1
plumed 1
birds 1
were 1
still 1
from 1
afar 1
came 1
the 1
answering 1
wail 1
of 1
a 1
leopard 1
and 1
the 1
deep 1
roar 1
of 1
a 1
lion 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
old 1
tarzan 1
who 1
turned 1
questioning 1
eyes 1
upon 1
the 1
little 1
knot 1
of 1
apes 1
before 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
old 1
tarzan 1
who 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
as 1
though 1
to 1
toss 1
back 1
a 1
heavy 1
mane 1
that 1
had 1
fallen 1
before 1
his 1
face 1
an 1
old 1
habit 1
dating 1
from 1
the 1
days 1
that 1
his 1
great 1
shock 1
of 1
thick 1
black 1
hair 1
had 1
fallen 1
about 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
often 1
tumbled 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
when 1
it 1
had 1
meant 1
life 1
or 1
death 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
vision 1
unobstructed 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
expect 1
an 1
immediate 1
attack 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
that 1
particular 1
surviving 1
bull 1
ape 1
who 1
felt 1
himself 1
best 1
fitted 1
to 1
contend 1
for 1
the 1
kingship 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
among 1
his 1
own 1
apes 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
unusual 1
for 1
an 1
entire 1
stranger 1
to 1
enter 1
a 1
community 1
and 1
after 1
having 1
dispatched 1
the 1
king 1
assume 1
the 1
leadership 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
himself 1
together 1
with 1
the 1
fallen 1
monarch 1
s 1
mates 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
if 1
he 1
made 1
no 1
attempt 1
to 1
follow 1
them 1
they 1
might 1
move 1
slowly 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
later 1
to 1
fight 1
among 1
themselves 1
for 1
the 1
supremacy 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
king 1
of 1
them 1
if 1
he 1
so 1
chose 1
he 1
was 1
confident 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
sure 1
he 1
cared 1
to 1
assume 1
the 1
sometimes 1
irksome 1
duties 1
of 1
that 1
position 1
for 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
no 1
particular 1
advantage 1
to 1
be 1
gained 1
thereby 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
younger 1
apes 1
a 1
huge 1
splendidly 1
muscled 1
brute 1
was 1
edging 1
threateningly 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
through 1
his 1
bared 1
fighting 1
fangs 1
there 1
issued 1
a 1
low 1
sullen 1
growl 1
tarzan 1
watched 1
his 1
every 1
move 1
standing 1
rigid 1
as 1
a 1
statue 1
to 1
have 1
fallen 1
back 1
a 1
step 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
precipitate 1
an 1
immediate 1
charge 1
to 1
have 1
rushed 1
forward 1
to 1
meet 1
the 1
other 1
might 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
result 1
or 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
put 1
the 1
bellicose 1
one 1
to 1
flight 1
it 1
all 1
depended 1
upon 1
the 1
young 1
bull 1
s 1
stock 1
of 1
courage 1
to 1
stand 1
perfectly 1
still 1
waiting 1
was 1
the 1
middle 1
course 1
in 1
this 1
event 1
the 1
bull 1
would 1
according 1
to 1
custom 1
approach 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
his 1
attention 1
growling 1
hideously 1
and 1
baring 1
slavering 1
fangs 1
slowly 1
he 1
would 1
circle 1
about 1
the 1
other 1
as 1
though 1
with 1
a 1
chip 1
upon 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
this 1
he 1
did 1
even 1
as 1
tarzan 1
had 1
foreseen 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
bluff 1
royal 1
or 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
so 1
unstable 1
is 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
an 1
ape 1
a 1
passing 1
impulse 1
might 1
hurl 1
the 1
hairy 1
mass 1
tearing 1
and 1
rending 1
upon 1
the 1
man 1
without 1
an 1
instant 1
s 1
warning 1
as 1
the 1
brute 1
circled 1
him 1
tarzan 1
turned 1
slowly 1
keeping 1
his 1
eyes 1
ever 1
upon 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
his 1
antagonist 1
he 1
had 1
appraised 1
the 1
young 1
bull 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
never 1
quite 1
felt 1
equal 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
overthrowing 1
his 1
former 1
king 1
but 1
who 1
one 1
day 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
tarzan 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
beast 1
was 1
of 1
wondrous 1
proportions 1
standing 1
over 1
seven 1
feet 1
upon 1
his 1
short 1
bowed 1
legs 1
his 1
great 1
hairy 1
arms 1
reached 1
almost 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
even 1
when 1
he 1
stood 1
erect 1
and 1
his 1
fighting 1
fangs 1
now 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
tarzan 1
s 1
face 1
were 1
exceptionally 1
long 1
and 1
sharp 1
like 1
the 1
others 1
of 1
his 1
tribe 1
he 1
differed 1
in 1
several 1
minor 1
essentials 1
from 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
tarzan 1
s 1
boyhood 1
at 1
first 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
experienced 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
hope 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
shaggy 1
bodies 1
of 1
the 1
anthropoids 1
a 1
hope 1
that 1
by 1
some 1
strange 1
freak 1
of 1
fate 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
again 1
returned 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
tribe 1
but 1
a 1
closer 1
inspection 1
had 1
convinced 1
him 1
that 1
these 1
were 1
another 1
species 1
as 1
the 1
threatening 1
bull 1
continued 1
his 1
stiff 1
and 1
jerky 1
circling 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
much 1
after 1
the 1
manner 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
noted 1
among 1
dogs 1
when 1
a 1
strange 1
canine 1
comes 1
among 1
them 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
tarzan 1
to 1
discover 1
if 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
tribe 1
was 1
identical 1
with 1
that 1
of 1
this 1
other 1
family 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
addressed 1
the 1
brute 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
kerchak 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
he 1
asked 1
who 1
threatens 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
the 1
hairy 1
brute 1
looked 1
his 1
surprise 1
i 1
am 1
akut 1
replied 1
the 1
other 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
simple 1
primal 1
tongue 1
which 1
is 1
so 1
low 1
in 1
the 1
scale 1
of 1
spoken 1
languages 1
that 1
as 1
tarzan 1
had 1
surmised 1
it 1
was 1
identical 1
with 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
first 1
twenty 1
years 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
had 1
been 1
spent 1
i 1
am 1
akut 1
said 1
the 1
ape 1
molak 1
is 1
dead 1
i 1
am 1
king 1
go 1
away 1
or 1
i 1
shall 1
kill 1
you 1
you 1
saw 1
how 1
easily 1
i 1
killed 1
molak 1
replied 1
tarzan 1
so 1
i 1
could 1
kill 1
you 1
if 1
i 1
cared 1
to 1
be 1
king 1
but 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
akut 1
all 1
he 1
wishes 1
is 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
peace 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
let 1
us 1
be 1
friends 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
can 1
help 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
help 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
you 1
cannot 1
kill 1
akut 1
replied 1
the 1
other 1
none 1
is 1
so 1
great 1
as 1
akut 1
had 1
you 1
not 1
killed 1
molak 1
akut 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
for 1
akut 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
be 1
king 1
for 1
answer 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
hurled 1
himself 1
upon 1
the 1
great 1
brute 1
who 1
during 1
the 1
conversation 1
had 1
slightly 1
relaxed 1
his 1
vigilance 1
in 1
the 1
twinkling 1
of 1
an 1
eye 1
the 1
man 1
had 1
seized 1
the 1
wrist 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
ape 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
other 1
could 1
grapple 1
with 1
him 1
had 1
whirled 1
him 1
about 1
and 1
leaped 1
upon 1
his 1
broad 1
back 1
down 1
they 1
went 1
together 1
but 1
so 1
well 1
had 1
tarzan 1
s 1
plan 1
worked 1
out 1
that 1
before 1
ever 1
they 1
touched 1
the 1
ground 1
he 1
had 1
gained 1
the 1
same 1
hold 1
upon 1
akut 1
that 1
had 1
broken 1
molak 1
s 1
neck 1
slowly 1
he 1
brought 1
the 1
pressure 1
to 1
bear 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
in 1
days 1
gone 1
by 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
kerchak 1
the 1
chance 1
to 1
surrender 1
and 1
live 1
so 1
now 1
he 1
gave 1
to 1
akut 1
in 1
whom 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
possible 1
ally 1
of 1
great 1
strength 1
and 1
resource 1
the 1
option 1
of 1
living 1
in 1
amity 1
with 1
him 1
or 1
dying 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
seen 1
his 1
savage 1
and 1
heretofore 1
invincible 1
king 1
die 1
ka 1
goda 1
whispered 1
tarzan 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
beneath 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
same 1
question 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
whispered 1
to 1
kerchak 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
it 1
means 1
broadly 1
do 1
you 1
surrender 1
akut 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
creaking 1
sound 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
just 1
before 1
molak 1
s 1
thick 1
neck 1
had 1
snapped 1
and 1
he 1
shuddered 1
he 1
hated 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
kingship 1
though 1
so 1
again 1
he 1
struggled 1
to 1
free 1
himself 1
but 1
a 1
sudden 1
torturing 1
pressure 1
upon 1
his 1
vertebra 1
brought 1
an 1
agonized 1
ka 1
goda 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
tarzan 1
relaxed 1
his 1
grip 1
a 1
trifle 1
you 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
king 1
akut 1
he 1
said 1
tarzan 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
king 1
if 1
any 1
question 1
your 1
right 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
will 1
help 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
battles 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
rose 1
and 1
akut 1
came 1
slowly 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
shaking 1
his 1
bullet 1
head 1
and 1
growling 1
angrily 1
he 1
waddled 1
toward 1
his 1
tribe 1
looking 1
first 1
at 1
one 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
larger 1
bulls 1
who 1
might 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
challenge 1
his 1
leadership 1
but 1
none 1
did 1
so 1
instead 1
they 1
drew 1
away 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
whole 1
pack 1
moved 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
and 1
tarzan 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
once 1
more 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
was 1
sore 1
from 1
the 1
wounds 1
that 1
molak 1
had 1
inflicted 1
upon 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
inured 1
to 1
physical 1
suffering 1
and 1
endured 1
it 1
with 1
the 1
calm 1
and 1
fortitude 1
of 1
the 1
wild 1
beasts 1
that 1
had 1
taught 1
him 1
to 1
lead 1
the 1
jungle 1
life 1
after 1
the 1
manner 1
of 1
all 1
those 1
that 1
are 1
born 1
to 1
it 1
his 1
first 1
need 1
he 1
realized 1
was 1
for 1
weapons 1
of 1
offence 1
and 1
defence 1
for 1
his 1
encounter 1
with 1
the 1
apes 1
and 1
the 1
distant 1
notes 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
voices 1
of 1
numa 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
sheeta 1
the 1
panther 1
warned 1
him 1
that 1
his 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
life 1
of 1
indolent 1
ease 1
and 1
security 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
existence 1
of 1
constant 1
bloodshed 1
and 1
danger 1
to 1
the 1
hunting 1
and 1
the 1
being 1
hunted 1
grim 1
beasts 1
would 1
stalk 1
him 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
stalked 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
never 1
would 1
there 1
be 1
a 1
moment 1
by 1
savage 1
day 1
or 1
by 1
cruel 1
night 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
instant 1
need 1
of 1
such 1
crude 1
weapons 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
fashion 1
from 1
the 1
materials 1
at 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
shore 1
he 1
found 1
an 1
out 1
cropping 1
of 1
brittle 1
igneous 1
rock 1
by 1
dint 1
of 1
much 1
labour 1
he 1
managed 1
to 1
chip 1
off 1
a 1
narrow 1
sliver 1
some 1
twelve 1
inches 1
long 1
by 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
inch 1
thick 1
one 1
edge 1
was 1
quite 1
thin 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
near 1
the 1
tip 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
rudiment 1
of 1
a 1
knife 1
with 1
it 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
searching 1
until 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
fallen 1
tree 1
of 1
a 1
certain 1
species 1
of 1
hardwood 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
familiar 1
from 1
this 1
he 1
cut 1
a 1
small 1
straight 1
branch 1
which 1
he 1
pointed 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
then 1
he 1
scooped 1
a 1
small 1
round 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
prostrate 1
trunk 1
into 1
this 1
he 1
crumbled 1
a 1
few 1
bits 1
of 1
dry 1
bark 1
minutely 1
shredded 1
after 1
which 1
he 1
inserted 1
the 1
tip 1
of 1
his 1
pointed 1
stick 1
and 1
sitting 1
astride 1
the 1
bole 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
spun 1
the 1
slender 1
rod 1
rapidly 1
between 1
his 1
palms 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
a 1
thin 1
smoke 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
little 1
mass 1
of 1
tinder 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
whole 1
broke 1
into 1
flame 1
heaping 1
some 1
larger 1
twigs 1
and 1
sticks 1
upon 1
the 1
tiny 1
fire 1
tarzan 1
soon 1
had 1
quite 1
a 1
respectable 1
blaze 1
roaring 1
in 1
the 1
enlarging 1
cavity 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
tree 1
into 1
this 1
he 1
thrust 1
the 1
blade 1
of 1
his 1
stone 1
knife 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
became 1
superheated 1
he 1
would 1
withdraw 1
it 1
touching 1
a 1
spot 1
near 1
the 1
thin 1
edge 1
with 1
a 1
drop 1
of 1
moisture 1
beneath 1
the 1
wetted 1
area 1
a 1
little 1
flake 1
of 1
the 1
glassy 1
material 1
would 1
crack 1
and 1
scale 1
away 1
thus 1
very 1
slowly 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
commenced 1
the 1
tedious 1
operation 1
of 1
putting 1
a 1
thin 1
edge 1
upon 1
his 1
primitive 1
hunting 1
knife 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
attempt 1
to 1
accomplish 1
the 1
feat 1
all 1
in 1
one 1
sitting 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
was 1
content 1
to 1
achieve 1
a 1
cutting 1
edge 1
of 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
inches 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
cut 1
a 1
long 1
pliable 1
bow 1
a 1
handle 1
for 1
his 1
knife 1
a 1
stout 1
cudgel 1
and 1
a 1
goodly 1
supply 1
of 1
arrows 1
these 1
he 1
cached 1
in 1
a 1
tall 1
tree 1
beside 1
a 1
little 1
stream 1
and 1
here 1
also 1
he 1
constructed 1
a 1
platform 1
with 1
a 1
roof 1
of 1
palm 1
leaves 1
above 1
it 1
when 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
had 1
been 1
finished 1
it 1
was 1
growing 1
dusk 1
and 1
tarzan 1
felt 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
to 1
eat 1
he 1
had 1
noted 1
during 1
the 1
brief 1
incursion 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
into 1
the 1
forest 1
that 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
up 1
stream 1
from 1
his 1
tree 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
much 1
used 1
watering 1
place 1
where 1
from 1
the 1
trampled 1
mud 1
of 1
either 1
bank 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
beasts 1
of 1
all 1
sorts 1
and 1
in 1
great 1
numbers 1
came 1
to 1
drink 1
to 1
this 1
spot 1
the 1
hungry 1
ape 1
man 1
made 1
his 1
silent 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
upper 1
terrace 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
tops 1
he 1
swung 1
with 1
the 1
grace 1
and 1
ease 1
of 1
a 1
monkey 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
heavy 1
burden 1
upon 1
his 1
heart 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
happy 1
in 1
this 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
free 1
life 1
of 1
his 1
boyhood 1
yet 1
even 1
with 1
that 1
burden 1
he 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
little 1
habits 1
and 1
manners 1
of 1
his 1
early 1
life 1
that 1
were 1
in 1
reality 1
more 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
him 1
than 1
the 1
thin 1
veneer 1
of 1
civilization 1
that 1
the 1
past 1
three 1
years 1
of 1
his 1
association 1
with 1
the 1
white 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
outer 1
world 1
had 1
spread 1
lightly 1
over 1
him 1
a 1
veneer 1
that 1
only 1
hid 1
the 1
crudities 1
of 1
the 1
beast 1
that 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
had 1
been 1
could 1
his 1
fellow 1
peers 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
lords 1
have 1
seen 1
him 1
then 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
held 1
up 1
their 1
noble 1
hands 1
in 1
holy 1
horror 1
silently 1
he 1
crouched 1
in 1
the 1
lower 1
branches 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
forest 1
giant 1
that 1
overhung 1
the 1
trail 1
his 1
keen 1
eyes 1
and 1
sensitive 1
ears 1
strained 1
into 1
the 1
distant 1
jungle 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
knew 1
his 1
dinner 1
would 1
presently 1
emerge 1
nor 1
had 1
he 1
long 1
to 1
wait 1
scarce 1
had 1
he 1
settled 1
himself 1
to 1
a 1
comfortable 1
position 1
his 1
lithe 1
muscular 1
legs 1
drawn 1
well 1
up 1
beneath 1
him 1
as 1
the 1
panther 1
draws 1
his 1
hindquarters 1
in 1
preparation 1
for 1
the 1
spring 1
than 1
bara 1
the 1
deer 1
came 1
daintily 1
down 1
to 1
drink 1
but 1
more 1
than 1
bara 1
was 1
coming 1
behind 1
the 1
graceful 1
buck 1
came 1
another 1
which 1
the 1
deer 1
could 1
neither 1
see 1
nor 1
scent 1
but 1
whose 1
movements 1
were 1
apparent 1
to 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
elevated 1
position 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
ambush 1
he 1
knew 1
not 1
yet 1
exactly 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
moved 1
so 1
stealthily 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
a 1
few 1
hundred 1
yards 1
behind 1
the 1
deer 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
great 1
beast 1
of 1
prey 1
stalking 1
bara 1
for 1
the 1
selfsame 1
purpose 1
as 1
that 1
which 1
prompted 1
him 1
to 1
await 1
the 1
fleet 1
animal 1
numa 1
perhaps 1
or 1
sheeta 1
the 1
panther 1
in 1
any 1
event 1
tarzan 1
could 1
see 1
his 1
repast 1
slipping 1
from 1
his 1
grasp 1
unless 1
bara 1
moved 1
more 1
rapidly 1
toward 1
the 1
ford 1
than 1
at 1
present 1
even 1
as 1
these 1
thoughts 1
passed 1
through 1
his 1
mind 1
some 1
noise 1
of 1
the 1
stalker 1
in 1
his 1
rear 1
must 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
buck 1
for 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
start 1
he 1
paused 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
trembling 1
in 1
his 1
tracks 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
swift 1
bound 1
dashed 1
straight 1
for 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
tarzan 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
intention 1
to 1
flee 1
through 1
the 1
shallow 1
ford 1
and 1
escape 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
not 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
behind 1
him 1
came 1
numa 1
tarzan 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
quite 1
plainly 1
now 1
below 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
bara 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
pass 1
could 1
he 1
do 1
it 1
but 1
even 1
as 1
he 1
asked 1
himself 1
the 1
question 1
the 1
hungry 1
man 1
launched 1
himself 1
from 1
his 1
perch 1
full 1
upon 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
startled 1
buck 1
in 1
another 1
instant 1
numa 1
would 1
be 1
upon 1
them 1
both 1
so 1
if 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
were 1
to 1
dine 1
that 1
night 1
or 1
ever 1
again 1
he 1
must 1
act 1
quickly 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
touched 1
the 1
sleek 1
hide 1
of 1
the 1
deer 1
with 1
a 1
momentum 1
that 1
sent 1
the 1
animal 1
to 1
its 1
knees 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
grasped 1
a 1
horn 1
in 1
either 1
hand 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
quick 1
wrench 1
twisted 1
the 1
animal 1
s 1
neck 1
completely 1
round 1
until 1
he 1
felt 1
the 1
vertebrae 1
snap 1
beneath 1
his 1
grip 1
the 1
lion 1
was 1
roaring 1
in 1
rage 1
close 1
behind 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
swung 1
the 1
deer 1
across 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
grasping 1
a 1
foreleg 1
between 1
his 1
strong 1
teeth 1
leaped 1
for 1
the 1
nearest 1
of 1
the 1
lower 1
branches 1
that 1
swung 1
above 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
both 1
hands 1
he 1
grasped 1
the 1
limb 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
numa 1
sprang 1
drew 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
prey 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
of 1
the 1
animal 1
s 1
cruel 1
talons 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
thud 1
below 1
him 1
as 1
the 1
baffled 1
cat 1
fell 1
back 1
to 1
earth 1
and 1
then 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
drawing 1
his 1
dinner 1
farther 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
a 1
higher 1
limb 1
looked 1
down 1
with 1
grinning 1
face 1
into 1
the 1
gleaming 1
yellow 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
wild 1
beast 1
that 1
glared 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
from 1
beneath 1
and 1
with 1
taunting 1
insults 1
flaunted 1
the 1
tender 1
carcass 1
of 1
his 1
kill 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
him 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
cheated 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
crude 1
stone 1
knife 1
he 1
cut 1
a 1
juicy 1
steak 1
from 1
the 1
hindquarters 1
and 1
while 1
the 1
great 1
lion 1
paced 1
growling 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
below 1
him 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
filled 1
his 1
savage 1
belly 1
nor 1
ever 1
in 1
the 1
choicest 1
of 1
his 1
exclusive 1
london 1
clubs 1
had 1
a 1
meal 1
tasted 1
more 1
palatable 1
the 1
warm 1
blood 1
of 1
his 1
kill 1
smeared 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
face 1
and 1
filled 1
his 1
nostrils 1
with 1
the 1
scent 1
that 1
the 1
savage 1
carnivora 1
love 1
best 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
carcass 1
in 1
a 1
high 1
fork 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
dined 1
and 1
with 1
numa 1
trailing 1
below 1
him 1
still 1
keen 1
for 1
revenge 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
tree 1
top 1
shelter 1
where 1
he 1
slept 1
until 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
high 1
the 1
following 1
morning 1
chapter 1
4 1
sheeta 1
the 1
next 1
few 1
days 1
were 1
occupied 1
by 1
tarzan 1
in 1
completing 1
his 1
weapons 1
and 1
exploring 1
the 1
jungle 1
he 1
strung 1
his 1
bow 1
with 1
tendons 1
from 1
the 1
buck 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
dined 1
his 1
first 1
evening 1
upon 1
the 1
new 1
shore 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
preferred 1
the 1
gut 1
of 1
sheeta 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
he 1
was 1
content 1
to 1
wait 1
until 1
opportunity 1
permitted 1
him 1
to 1
kill 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
cats 1
he 1
also 1
braided 1
a 1
long 1
grass 1
rope 1
such 1
a 1
rope 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
so 1
many 1
years 1
before 1
to 1
tantalize 1
the 1
ill 1
natured 1
tublat 1
and 1
which 1
later 1
had 1
developed 1
into 1
a 1
wondrous 1
effective 1
weapon 1
in 1
the 1
practised 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
ape 1
boy 1
a 1
sheath 1
and 1
handle 1
for 1
his 1
hunting 1
knife 1
he 1
fashioned 1
and 1
a 1
quiver 1
for 1
arrows 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
hide 1
of 1
bara 1
a 1
belt 1
and 1
loin 1
cloth 1
then 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
to 1
learn 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
strange 1
land 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
his 1
old 1
familiar 1
west 1
coast 1
of 1
the 1
african 1
continent 1
he 1
knew 1
from 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
it 1
faced 1
east 1
the 1
rising 1
sun 1
came 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
before 1
the 1
threshold 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
but 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
east 1
coast 1
of 1
africa 1
he 1
was 1
equally 1
positive 1
for 1
he 1
felt 1
satisfied 1
that 1
the 1
kincaid 1
had 1
not 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
mediterranean 1
the 1
suez 1
canal 1
and 1
the 1
red 1
sea 1
nor 1
had 1
she 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
round 1
the 1
cape 1
of 1
good 1
hope 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
at 1
a 1
loss 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
sometimes 1
he 1
wondered 1
if 1
the 1
ship 1
had 1
crossed 1
the 1
broad 1
atlantic 1
to 1
deposit 1
him 1
upon 1
some 1
wild 1
south 1
american 1
shore 1
but 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
numa 1
the 1
lion 1
decided 1
him 1
that 1
such 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
case 1
as 1
tarzan 1
made 1
his 1
lonely 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
paralleling 1
the 1
shore 1
he 1
felt 1
strong 1
upon 1
him 1
a 1
desire 1
for 1
companionship 1
so 1
that 1
gradually 1
he 1
commenced 1
to 1
regret 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
cast 1
his 1
lot 1
with 1
the 1
apes 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
nothing 1
of 1
them 1
since 1
that 1
first 1
day 1
when 1
the 1
influences 1
of 1
civilization 1
were 1
still 1
paramount 1
within 1
him 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
more 1
nearly 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
tarzan 1
of 1
old 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
appreciated 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
little 1
in 1
common 1
between 1
himself 1
and 1
the 1
great 1
anthropoids 1
still 1
they 1
were 1
better 1
than 1
no 1
company 1
at 1
all 1
moving 1
leisurely 1
sometimes 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
again 1
among 1
the 1
lower 1
branches 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
gathering 1
an 1
occasional 1
fruit 1
or 1
turning 1
over 1
a 1
fallen 1
log 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
larger 1
bugs 1
which 1
he 1
still 1
found 1
as 1
palatable 1
as 1
of 1
old 1
tarzan 1
had 1
covered 1
a 1
mile 1
or 1
more 1
when 1
his 1
attention 1
was 1
attracted 1
by 1
the 1
scent 1
of 1
sheeta 1
up 1
wind 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
now 1
sheeta 1
the 1
panther 1
was 1
one 1
whom 1
tarzan 1
was 1
exceptionally 1
glad 1
to 1
fall 1
in 1
with 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
it 1
in 1
mind 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
utilize 1
the 1
great 1
cat 1
s 1
strong 1
gut 1
for 1
his 1
bow 1
but 1
also 1
to 1
fashion 1
a 1
new 1
quiver 1
and 1
loin 1
cloth 1
from 1
pieces 1
of 1
his 1
hide 1
so 1
whereas 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
gone 1
carelessly 1
before 1
he 1
now 1
became 1
the 1
personification 1
of 1
noiseless 1
stealth 1
swiftly 1
and 1
silently 1
he 1
glided 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
in 1
the 1
wake 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
cat 1
nor 1
was 1
the 1
pursuer 1
for 1
all 1
his 1
noble 1
birth 1
one 1
whit 1
less 1
savage 1
than 1
the 1
wild 1
fierce 1
thing 1
he 1
stalked 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
closer 1
to 1
sheeta 1
he 1
became 1
aware 1
that 1
the 1
panther 1
on 1
his 1
part 1
was 1
stalking 1
game 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
even 1
as 1
he 1
realized 1
this 1
fact 1
there 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
nostrils 1
wafted 1
from 1
his 1
right 1
by 1
a 1
vagrant 1
breeze 1
the 1
strong 1
odour 1
of 1
a 1
company 1
of 1
great 1
apes 1
the 1
panther 1
had 1
taken 1
to 1
a 1
large 1
tree 1
as 1
tarzan 1
came 1
within 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
beyond 1
and 1
below 1
him 1
tarzan 1
saw 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
akut 1
lolling 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
natural 1
clearing 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
dozing 1
against 1
the 1
boles 1
of 1
trees 1
while 1
others 1
roamed 1
about 1
turning 1
over 1
bits 1
of 1
bark 1
from 1
beneath 1
which 1
they 1
transferred 1
the 1
luscious 1
grubs 1
and 1
beetles 1
to 1
their 1
mouths 1
akut 1
was 1
the 1
closest 1
to 1
sheeta 1
the 1
great 1
cat 1
lay 1
crouched 1
upon 1
a 1
thick 1
limb 1
hidden 1
from 1
the 1
ape 1
s 1
view 1
by 1
dense 1
foliage 1
waiting 1
patiently 1
until 1
the 1
anthropoid 1
should 1
come 1
within 1
range 1
of 1
his 1
spring 1
tarzan 1
cautiously 1
gained 1
a 1
position 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
tree 1
with 1
the 1
panther 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
above 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
left 1
hand 1
he 1
grasped 1
his 1
slim 1
stone 1
blade 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
preferred 1
to 1
use 1
his 1
noose 1
but 1
the 1
foliage 1
surrounding 1
the 1
huge 1
cat 1
precluded 1
the 1
possibility 1
of 1
an 1
accurate 1
throw 1
with 1
the 1
rope 1
akut 1
had 1
now 1
wandered 1
quite 1
close 1
beneath 1
the 1
tree 1
wherein 1
lay 1
the 1
waiting 1
death 1
sheeta 1
slowly 1
edged 1
his 1
hind 1
paws 1
along 1
the 1
branch 1
still 1
further 1
beneath 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
hideous 1
shriek 1
he 1
launched 1
himself 1
toward 1
the 1
great 1
ape 1
the 1
barest 1
fraction 1
of 1
a 1
second 1
before 1
his 1
spring 1
another 1
beast 1
of 1
prey 1
above 1
him 1
leaped 1
its 1
weird 1
and 1
savage 1
cry 1
mingling 1
with 1
his 1
as 1
the 1
startled 1
akut 1
looked 1
up 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
panther 1
almost 1
above 1
him 1
and 1
already 1
upon 1
the 1
panther 1
s 1
back 1
the 1
white 1
ape 1
that 1
had 1
bested 1
him 1
that 1
day 1
near 1
the 1
great 1
water 1
the 1
teeth 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
were 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
sheeta 1
s 1
neck 1
and 1
his 1
right 1
arm 1
was 1
round 1
the 1
fierce 1
throat 1
while 1
the 1
left 1
hand 1
grasping 1
a 1
slender 1
piece 1
of 1
stone 1
rose 1
and 1
fell 1
in 1
mighty 1
blows 1
upon 1
the 1
panther 1
s 1
side 1
behind 1
the 1
left 1
shoulder 1
akut 1
had 1
just 1
time 1
to 1
leap 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
to 1
avoid 1
being 1
pinioned 1
beneath 1
these 1
battling 1
monsters 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
with 1
a 1
crash 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
earth 1
at 1
his 1
feet 1
sheeta 1
was 1
screaming 1
snarling 1
and 1
roaring 1
horribly 1
but 1
the 1
white 1
ape 1
clung 1
tenaciously 1
and 1
in 1
silence 1
to 1
the 1
thrashing 1
body 1
of 1
his 1
quarry 1
steadily 1
and 1
remorselessly 1
the 1
stone 1
knife 1
was 1
driven 1
home 1
through 1
the 1
glossy 1
hide 1
time 1
and 1
again 1
it 1
drank 1
deep 1
until 1
with 1
a 1
final 1
agonized 1
lunge 1
and 1
shriek 1
the 1
great 1
feline 1
rolled 1
over 1
upon 1
its 1
side 1
and 1
save 1
for 1
the 1
spasmodic 1
jerking 1
of 1
its 1
muscles 1
lay 1
quiet 1
and 1
still 1
in 1
death 1
then 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
raised 1
his 1
head 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
over 1
the 1
carcass 1
of 1
his 1
kill 1
and 1
once 1
again 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
rang 1
his 1
wild 1
and 1
savage 1
victory 1
challenge 1
akut 1
and 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
stood 1
looking 1
in 1
startled 1
wonder 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
of 1
sheeta 1
and 1
the 1
lithe 1
straight 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
slain 1
him 1
tarzan 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
speak 1
he 1
had 1
saved 1
akut 1
s 1
life 1
for 1
a 1
purpose 1
and 1
knowing 1
the 1
limitations 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
intellect 1
he 1
also 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
make 1
this 1
purpose 1
plain 1
to 1
the 1
anthropoid 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
to 1
serve 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
hoped 1
i 1
am 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
he 1
said 1
mighty 1
hunter 1
mighty 1
fighter 1
by 1
the 1
great 1
water 1
i 1
spared 1
akut 1
s 1
life 1
when 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
taken 1
it 1
and 1
become 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
akut 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
saved 1
akut 1
from 1
death 1
beneath 1
the 1
rending 1
fangs 1
of 1
sheeta 1
when 1
akut 1
or 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
akut 1
is 1
in 1
danger 1
let 1
them 1
call 1
to 1
tarzan 1
thus 1
and 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
raised 1
the 1
hideous 1
cry 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
kerchak 1
had 1
been 1
wont 1
to 1
summon 1
its 1
absent 1
members 1
in 1
times 1
of 1
peril 1
and 1
he 1
continued 1
when 1
they 1
hear 1
tarzan 1
call 1
to 1
them 1
let 1
them 1
remember 1
what 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
for 1
akut 1
and 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
with 1
great 1
speed 1
shall 1
it 1
be 1
as 1
tarzan 1
says 1
huh 1
assented 1
akut 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
members 1
of 1
his 1
tribe 1
there 1
rose 1
a 1
unanimous 1
huh 1
then 1
presently 1
they 1
went 1
to 1
feeding 1
again 1
as 1
though 1
nothing 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
with 1
them 1
fed 1
john 1
clayton 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
he 1
noticed 1
however 1
that 1
akut 1
kept 1
always 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
was 1
often 1
looking 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
strange 1
wonder 1
in 1
his 1
little 1
bloodshot 1
eyes 1
and 1
once 1
he 1
did 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
tarzan 1
during 1
all 1
his 1
long 1
years 1
among 1
the 1
apes 1
had 1
never 1
before 1
seen 1
an 1
ape 1
do 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
particularly 1
tender 1
morsel 1
and 1
handed 1
it 1
to 1
tarzan 1
as 1
the 1
tribe 1
hunted 1
the 1
glistening 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
mingled 1
with 1
the 1
brown 1
shaggy 1
hides 1
of 1
his 1
companions 1
oftentimes 1
they 1
brushed 1
together 1
in 1
passing 1
but 1
the 1
apes 1
had 1
already 1
taken 1
his 1
presence 1
for 1
granted 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
as 1
much 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
akut 1
himself 1
if 1
he 1
came 1
too 1
close 1
to 1
a 1
she 1
with 1
a 1
young 1
baby 1
the 1
former 1
would 1
bare 1
her 1
great 1
fighting 1
fangs 1
and 1
growl 1
ominously 1
and 1
occasionally 1
a 1
truculent 1
young 1
bull 1
would 1
snarl 1
a 1
warning 1
if 1
tarzan 1
approached 1
while 1
the 1
former 1
was 1
eating 1
but 1
in 1
those 1
things 1
the 1
treatment 1
was 1
no 1
different 1
from 1
that 1
which 1
they 1
accorded 1
any 1
other 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
tarzan 1
on 1
his 1
part 1
felt 1
very 1
much 1
at 1
home 1
with 1
these 1
fierce 1
hairy 1
progenitors 1
of 1
primitive 1
man 1
he 1
skipped 1
nimbly 1
out 1
of 1
reach 1
of 1
each 1
threatening 1
female 1
for 1
such 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
apes 1
if 1
they 1
be 1
not 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
occasional 1
fits 1
of 1
bestial 1
rage 1
and 1
he 1
growled 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
truculent 1
young 1
bulls 1
baring 1
his 1
canine 1
teeth 1
even 1
as 1
they 1
thus 1
easily 1
he 1
fell 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
his 1
early 1
life 1
nor 1
did 1
it 1
seem 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
tasted 1
association 1
with 1
creatures 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
kind 1
for 1
the 1
better 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
week 1
he 1
roamed 1
the 1
jungle 1
with 1
his 1
new 1
friends 1
partly 1
because 1
of 1
a 1
desire 1
for 1
companionship 1
and 1
partially 1
through 1
a 1
well 1
laid 1
plan 1
to 1
impress 1
himself 1
indelibly 1
upon 1
their 1
memories 1
which 1
at 1
best 1
are 1
none 1
too 1
long 1
for 1
tarzan 1
from 1
past 1
experience 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
serve 1
him 1
in 1
good 1
stead 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
tribe 1
of 1
these 1
powerful 1
and 1
terrible 1
beasts 1
at 1
his 1
call 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
succeeded 1
to 1
some 1
extent 1
in 1
fixing 1
his 1
identity 1
upon 1
them 1
he 1
decided 1
to 1
again 1
take 1
up 1
his 1
exploration 1
to 1
this 1
end 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
toward 1
the 1
north 1
early 1
one 1
day 1
and 1
keeping 1
parallel 1
with 1
the 1
shore 1
travelled 1
rapidly 1
until 1
almost 1
nightfall 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
lay 1
almost 1
directly 1
to 1
his 1
right 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
instead 1
of 1
straight 1
out 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
as 1
heretofore 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
reasoned 1
that 1
the 1
shore 1
line 1
had 1
trended 1
toward 1
the 1
west 1
all 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
he 1
continued 1
his 1
rapid 1
course 1
and 1
when 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
sought 1
speed 1
he 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
middle 1
terrace 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
with 1
the 1
rapidity 1
of 1
a 1
squirrel 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
sun 1
set 1
straight 1
out 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
opposite 1
the 1
land 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
guessed 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
truth 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
suspecting 1
rokoff 1
had 1
set 1
him 1
ashore 1
upon 1
an 1
island 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
known 1
it 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
any 1
plan 1
that 1
would 1
render 1
his 1
position 1
more 1
harrowing 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
known 1
that 1
such 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
one 1
adopted 1
by 1
the 1
russian 1
and 1
what 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
lifetime 1
of 1
suspense 1
upon 1
an 1
uninhabited 1
island 1
rokoff 1
doubtless 1
had 1
sailed 1
directly 1
to 1
the 1
mainland 1
where 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
comparatively 1
easy 1
thing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
delivering 1
the 1
infant 1
jack 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
cruel 1
and 1
savage 1
foster 1
parents 1
who 1
as 1
his 1
note 1
had 1
threatened 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
upbringing 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
tarzan 1
shuddered 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
cruel 1
suffering 1
the 1
little 1
one 1
must 1
endure 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
life 1
even 1
though 1
he 1
might 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
individuals 1
whose 1
intentions 1
toward 1
him 1
were 1
of 1
the 1
kindest 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
had 1
sufficient 1
experience 1
with 1
the 1
lower 1
savages 1
of 1
africa 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
even 1
there 1
may 1
be 1
found 1
the 1
cruder 1
virtues 1
of 1
charity 1
and 1
humanity 1
but 1
their 1
lives 1
were 1
at 1
best 1
but 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
terrible 1
privations 1
dangers 1
and 1
sufferings 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
horrid 1
after 1
fate 1
that 1
awaited 1
the 1
child 1
as 1
he 1
grew 1
to 1
manhood 1
the 1
horrible 1
practices 1
that 1
would 1
form 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
training 1
would 1
alone 1
be 1
sufficient 1
to 1
bar 1
him 1
forever 1
from 1
association 1
with 1
those 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
race 1
and 1
station 1
in 1
life 1
a 1
cannibal 1
his 1
little 1
boy 1
a 1
savage 1
man 1
eater 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
horrible 1
to 1
contemplate 1
the 1
filed 1
teeth 1
the 1
slit 1
nose 1
the 1
little 1
face 1
painted 1
hideously 1
tarzan 1
groaned 1
could 1
he 1
but 1
feel 1
the 1
throat 1
of 1
the 1
russ 1
fiend 1
beneath 1
his 1
steel 1
fingers 1
and 1
jane 1
what 1
tortures 1
of 1
doubt 1
and 1
fear 1
and 1
uncertainty 1
she 1
must 1
be 1
suffering 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
his 1
position 1
was 1
infinitely 1
less 1
terrible 1
than 1
hers 1
for 1
he 1
at 1
least 1
knew 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
loved 1
ones 1
was 1
safe 1
at 1
home 1
while 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
either 1
her 1
husband 1
or 1
her 1
son 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
for 1
tarzan 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
guess 1
the 1
truth 1
for 1
the 1
knowledge 1
would 1
have 1
but 1
added 1
a 1
hundredfold 1
to 1
his 1
suffering 1
as 1
he 1
moved 1
slowly 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
his 1
mind 1
absorbed 1
by 1
his 1
gloomy 1
thoughts 1
there 1
presently 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
ears 1
a 1
strange 1
scratching 1
sound 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
translate 1
cautiously 1
he 1
moved 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
from 1
which 1
it 1
emanated 1
presently 1
coming 1
upon 1
a 1
huge 1
panther 1
pinned 1
beneath 1
a 1
fallen 1
tree 1
as 1
tarzan 1
approached 1
the 1
beast 1
turned 1
snarling 1
toward 1
him 1
struggling 1
to 1
extricate 1
itself 1
but 1
one 1
great 1
limb 1
across 1
its 1
back 1
and 1
the 1
smaller 1
entangling 1
branches 1
pinioning 1
its 1
legs 1
prevented 1
it 1
from 1
moving 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
in 1
any 1
direction 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
stood 1
before 1
the 1
helpless 1
cat 1
fitting 1
an 1
arrow 1
to 1
his 1
bow 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
dispatch 1
the 1
beast 1
that 1
otherwise 1
must 1
die 1
of 1
starvation 1
but 1
even 1
as 1
he 1
drew 1
back 1
the 1
shaft 1
a 1
sudden 1
whim 1
stayed 1
his 1
hand 1
why 1
rob 1
the 1
poor 1
creature 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
liberty 1
when 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
easy 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
restore 1
both 1
to 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
from 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
panther 1
moved 1
all 1
its 1
limbs 1
in 1
its 1
futile 1
struggle 1
for 1
freedom 1
that 1
its 1
spine 1
was 1
uninjured 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
same 1
reason 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
none 1
of 1
its 1
limbs 1
were 1
broken 1
relaxing 1
his 1
bowstring 1
he 1
returned 1
the 1
arrow 1
to 1
the 1
quiver 1
and 1
throwing 1
the 1
bow 1
about 1
his 1
shoulder 1
stepped 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
pinioned 1
beast 1
on 1
his 1
lips 1
was 1
the 1
soothing 1
purring 1
sound 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
cats 1
themselves 1
made 1
when 1
contented 1
and 1
happy 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
nearest 1
approach 1
to 1
a 1
friendly 1
advance 1
that 1
tarzan 1
could 1
make 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
sheeta 1
the 1
panther 1
ceased 1
his 1
snarling 1
and 1
eyed 1
the 1
ape 1

the 1
tree 1
s 1
great 1
weight 1
from 1
the 1
animal 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
to 1
come 1
within 1
reach 1
of 1
those 1
long 1
strong 1
talons 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
tree 1
had 1
been 1
removed 1
the 1
man 1
would 1
be 1
totally 1
at 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
beast 1
but 1
to 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
fear 1
was 1
a 1
thing 1
unknown 1
having 1
decided 1
he 1
acted 1
promptly 1
unhesitatingly 1
he 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
tangle 1
of 1
branches 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
panther 1
s 1
side 1
still 1
voicing 1
his 1
friendly 1
and 1
conciliatory 1
purr 1
the 1
cat 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
toward 1
the 1
man 1
eyeing 1
him 1
steadily 1
questioningly 1
the 1
long 1
fangs 1
were 1
bared 1
but 1
more 1
in 1
preparedness 1
than 1
threat 1
tarzan 1
put 1
a 1
broad 1
shoulder 1
beneath 1
the 1
bole 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
his 1
bare 1
leg 1
pressed 1
against 1
the 1
cat 1
s 1
silken 1
side 1
so 1
close 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
the 1
great 1
beast 1
slowly 1
tarzan 1
extended 1
his 1
giant 1
thews 1
the 1
great 1
tree 1
with 1
its 1
entangling 1
branches 1
rose 1
gradually 1
from 1
the 1
panther 1
who 1
feeling 1
the 1
encumbering 1
weight 1
diminish 1
quickly 1
crawled 1
from 1
beneath 1
tarzan 1
let 1
the 1
tree 1
fall 1
back 1
to 1
earth 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
beasts 1
turned 1
to 1
look 1
upon 1
one 1
another 1
a 1
grim 1
smile 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
lips 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
to 1
free 1
this 1
savage 1
jungle 1
fellow 1
nor 1
would 1
it 1
have 1
surprised 1
him 1
had 1
the 1
cat 1
sprung 1
upon 1
him 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
released 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
so 1
instead 1
it 1
stood 1
a 1
few 1
paces 1
from 1
the 1
tree 1
watching 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
clamber 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
maze 1
of 1
fallen 1
branches 1
once 1
outside 1
tarzan 1
was 1
not 1
three 1
paces 1
from 1
the 1
panther 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
taken 1
to 1
the 1
higher 1
branches 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
for 1
sheeta 1
cannot 1
climb 1
to 1
the 1
heights 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
can 1
go 1
but 1
something 1
a 1
spirit 1
of 1
bravado 1
perhaps 1
prompted 1
him 1
to 1
approach 1
the 1
panther 1
as 1
though 1
to 1
discover 1
if 1
any 1
feeling 1
of 1
gratitude 1
would 1
prompt 1
the 1
beast 1
to 1
friendliness 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
the 1
mighty 1
cat 1
the 1
creature 1
stepped 1
warily 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
brushed 1
past 1
him 1
within 1
a 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
dripping 1
jaws 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
continued 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
forest 1
the 1
panther 1
followed 1
on 1
behind 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
hound 1
follows 1
at 1
heel 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
tarzan 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
whether 1
the 1
beast 1
was 1
following 1
out 1
of 1
friendly 1
feelings 1
or 1
merely 1
stalking 1
him 1
against 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
hungry 1
but 1
finally 1
he 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
former 1
incentive 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
prompted 1
the 1
animal 1
s 1
action 1
later 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
the 1
scent 1
of 1
a 1
deer 1
sent 1
tarzan 1
into 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
dropped 1
his 1
noose 1
about 1
the 1
animal 1
s 1
neck 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
sheeta 1
using 1
a 1
purr 1
similar 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
utilized 1
to 1
pacify 1
the 1
brute 1
s 1
suspicions 1
earlier 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
but 1
a 1
trifle 1
louder 1
and 1
more 1
shrill 1
it 1
was 1
similar 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
panthers 1
use 1
after 1
a 1
kill 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
hunting 1
in 1
pairs 1
almost 1
immediately 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
crashing 1
of 1
the 1
underbrush 1
close 1
at 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
long 1
lithe 1
body 1
of 1
his 1
strange 1
companion 1
broke 1
into 1
view 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
bara 1
and 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
blood 1
the 1
panther 1
gave 1
forth 1
a 1
shrill 1
scream 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
two 1
beasts 1
were 1
feeding 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
upon 1
the 1
tender 1
meat 1
of 1
the 1
deer 1
for 1
several 1
days 1
this 1
strangely 1
assorted 1
pair 1
roamed 1
the 1
jungle 1
together 1
when 1
one 1
made 1
a 1
kill 1
he 1
called 1
the 1
other 1
and 1
thus 1
they 1
fed 1
well 1
and 1
often 1
on 1
one 1
occasion 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
dining 1
upon 1
the 1
carcass 1
of 1
a 1
boar 1
that 1
sheeta 1
had 1
dispatched 1
numa 1
the 1
lion 1
grim 1
and 1
terrible 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
tangled 1
grasses 1
close 1
beside 1
them 1
with 1
an 1
angry 1
warning 1
roar 1
he 1
sprang 1
forward 1
to 1
chase 1
them 1
from 1
their 1
kill 1
sheeta 1
bounded 1
into 1
a 1
near 1
by 1
thicket 1
while 1
tarzan 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
low 1
branches 1
of 1
an 1
overhanging 1
tree 1
here 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
unloosed 1
his 1
grass 1
rope 1
from 1
about 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
as 1
numa 1
stood 1
above 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
boar 1
challenging 1
head 1
erect 1
he 1
dropped 1
the 1
sinuous 1
noose 1
about 1
the 1
maned 1
neck 1
drawing 1
the 1
stout 1
strands 1
taut 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
jerk 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
he 1
called 1
shrilly 1
to 1
sheeta 1
as 1
he 1
drew 1
the 1
struggling 1
lion 1
upward 1
until 1
only 1
his 1
hind 1
feet 1
touched 1
the 1
ground 1
quickly 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
rope 1
fast 1
to 1
a 1
stout 1
branch 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
panther 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
his 1
summons 1
leaped 1
into 1
sight 1
tarzan 1
dropped 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
beside 1
the 1
struggling 1
and 1
infuriated 1
numa 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
sharp 1
knife 1
sprang 1
upon 1
him 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
even 1
as 1
sheeta 1
did 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
the 1
panther 1
tore 1
and 1
rent 1
numa 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
while 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
struck 1
home 1
with 1
his 1
stone 1
knife 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
so 1
that 1
before 1
the 1
mighty 1
clawing 1
of 1
the 1
king 1
of 1
beasts 1
had 1
succeeded 1
in 1
parting 1
the 1
rope 1
he 1
hung 1
quite 1
dead 1
and 1
harmless 1
in 1
the 1
noose 1
and 1
then 1
upon 1
the 1
jungle 1
air 1
there 1
rose 1
in 1
unison 1
from 1
two 1
savage 1
throats 1
the 1
victory 1
cry 1
of 1
the 1
bull 1
ape 1
and 1
the 1
panther 1
blended 1
into 1
one 1
frightful 1
and 1
uncanny 1
scream 1
as 1
the 1
last 1
notes 1
died 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
drawn 1
fearsome 1
wail 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
painted 1
warriors 1
drawing 1
their 1
long 1
war 1
canoe 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
halted 1
to 1
stare 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
and 1
to 1
listen 1
chapter 1
5 1
mugambi 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
tarzan 1
had 1
travelled 1
entirely 1
about 1
the 1
coast 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
made 1
several 1
trips 1
inland 1
from 1
various 1
points 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
human 1
being 1
upon 1
it 1
nowhere 1
had 1
he 1
found 1
any 1
sign 1
that 1
men 1
had 1
stopped 1
even 1
temporarily 1
upon 1
this 1
shore 1
though 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
so 1
quickly 1
does 1
the 1
rank 1
vegetation 1
of 1
the 1
tropics 1
erase 1
all 1
but 1
the 1
most 1
permanent 1
of 1
human 1
monuments 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
in 1
error 1
in 1
his 1
deductions 1
the 1
day 1
following 1
the 1
killing 1
of 1
numa 1
tarzan 1
and 1
sheeta 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
tribe 1
of 1
akut 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
the 1
great 1
apes 1
took 1
to 1
flight 1
but 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
tarzan 1
succeeded 1
in 1
recalling 1
them 1
it 1
had 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
least 1
an 1
interesting 1
experiment 1
to 1
attempt 1
to 1
reconcile 1
these 1
hereditary 1
enemies 1
he 1
welcomed 1
anything 1
that 1
would 1
occupy 1
his 1
time 1
and 1
his 1
mind 1
beyond 1
the 1
filling 1
of 1
his 1
belly 1
and 1
the 1
gloomy 1
thoughts 1
to 1
which 1
he 1
fell 1
prey 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
idle 1
to 1
communicate 1
his 1
plan 1
to 1
the 1
apes 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
particularly 1
difficult 1
matter 1
though 1
their 1
narrow 1
and 1
limited 1
vocabulary 1
was 1
strained 1
in 1
the 1
effort 1
but 1
to 1
impress 1
upon 1
the 1
little 1
wicked 1
brain 1
of 1
sheeta 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
hunt 1
with 1
and 1
not 1
for 1
his 1
legitimate 1
prey 1
proved 1
a 1
task 1
almost 1
beyond 1
the 1
powers 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
tarzan 1
among 1
his 1
other 1
weapons 1
possessed 1
a 1
long 1
stout 1
cudgel 1
and 1
after 1
fastening 1
his 1
rope 1
about 1
the 1
panther 1
s 1
neck 1
he 1
used 1
this 1
instrument 1
freely 1
upon 1
the 1
snarling 1
beast 1
endeavouring 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
to 1
impress 1
upon 1
its 1
memory 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
not 1
attack 1
the 1
great 1
shaggy 1
manlike 1
creatures 1
that 1
had 1
approached 1
more 1
closely 1
once 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
the 1
rope 1
about 1
sheeta 1
s 1
neck 1
that 1
the 1
cat 1
did 1
not 1
turn 1
and 1
rend 1
tarzan 1
is 1
something 1
of 1
a 1
miracle 1
which 1
may 1
possibly 1
be 1
accounted 1
for 1
by 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
twice 1
when 1
it 1
turned 1
growling 1
upon 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
he 1
had 1
rapped 1
it 1
sharply 1
upon 1
its 1
sensitive 1
nose 1
inculcating 1
in 1
its 1
mind 1
thereby 1
a 1
most 1
wholesome 1
fear 1
of 1
the 1
cudgel 1
and 1
the 1
ape 1
beasts 1
behind 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
question 1
if 1
the 1
original 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
attachment 1
for 1
tarzan 1
was 1
still 1
at 1
all 1
clear 1
in 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
though 1
doubtless 1
some 1
subconscious 1
suggestion 1
superinduced 1
by 1
this 1
primary 1
reason 1
and 1
aided 1
and 1
abetted 1
by 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
the 1
past 1
few 1
days 1
did 1
much 1
to 1
compel 1
the 1
beast 1
to 1
tolerate 1
treatment 1
at 1
his 1
hands 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
sent 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
throat 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
creature 1
then 1
too 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
compelling 1
force 1
of 1
the 1
manmind 1
exerting 1
its 1
powerful 1
influence 1
over 1
this 1
creature 1
of 1
a 1
lower 1
order 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
this 1
that 1
proved 1
the 1
most 1
potent 1
factor 1
in 1
tarzan 1
s 1
supremacy 1
over 1
sheeta 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
that 1
had 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
fallen 1
under 1
his 1
domination 1

it 1
may 1
for 1
days 1
the 1
man 1
the 1
panther 1
and 1
the 1
great 1
apes 1
roamed 1
their 1
savage 1
haunts 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
making 1
their 1
kills 1
together 1
and 1
sharing 1
them 1
with 1
one 1
another 1
and 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
fierce 1
and 1
savage 1
band 1
none 1
was 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
the 1
smooth 1
skinned 1
powerful 1
beast 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
short 1
months 1
before 1
a 1
familiar 1
figure 1
in 1
many 1
a 1
london 1
drawing 1
room 1
sometimes 1
the 1
beasts 1
separated 1
to 1
follow 1
their 1
own 1
inclinations 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
occasions 1
when 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
wandered 1
through 1
the 1
tree 1
tops 1
toward 1
the 1
beach 1
and 1
was 1
stretched 1
in 1
the 1
hot 1
sun 1
upon 1
the 1
sand 1
that 1
from 1
the 1
low 1
summit 1
of 1
a 1
near 1
by 1
promontory 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
keen 1
eyes 1
discovered 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
owner 1
of 1
the 1
eyes 1
looked 1
in 1
astonishment 1
at 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
white 1
man 1
basking 1
in 1
the 1
rays 1
of 1
that 1
hot 1
tropic 1
sun 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
making 1
a 1
sign 1
to 1
some 1
one 1
behind 1
him 1
presently 1
another 1
pair 1
of 1
eyes 1
were 1
looking 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
and 1
another 1
until 1
a 1
full 1
score 1
of 1
hideously 1
trapped 1
savage 1
warriors 1
were 1
lying 1
upon 1
their 1
bellies 1
along 1
the 1
crest 1
of 1
the 1
ridge 1
watching 1
the 1
white 1
skinned 1
stranger 1
they 1
were 1
down 1
wind 1
from 1
tarzan 1
and 1
so 1
their 1
scent 1
was 1
not 1
carried 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
as 1
his 1
back 1
was 1
turned 1
half 1
toward 1
them 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
their 1
cautious 1
advance 1
over 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
promontory 1
and 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
rank 1
grass 1
toward 1
the 1
sandy 1
beach 1
where 1
he 1
lay 1
big 1
fellows 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
their 1
barbaric 1
headdresses 1
and 1
grotesquely 1
painted 1
faces 1
together 1
with 1
their 1
many 1
metal 1
ornaments 1
and 1
gorgeously 1
coloured 1
feathers 1
adding 1
to 1
their 1
wild 1
fierce 1
appearance 1
once 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
ridge 1
they 1
came 1
cautiously 1
to 1
their 1
feet 1
and 1
bent 1
half 1
double 1
advanced 1
silently 1
upon 1
the 1
unconscious 1
white 1
man 1
their 1
heavy 1
war 1
clubs 1
swinging 1
menacingly 1
in 1
their 1
brawny 1
hands 1
the 1
mental 1
suffering 1
that 1
tarzan 1
s 1
sorrowful 1
thoughts 1
induced 1
had 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
numbing 1
his 1
keen 1
perceptive 1
faculties 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
advancing 1
savages 1
were 1
almost 1
upon 1
him 1
before 1
he 1
became 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
longer 1
alone 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
so 1
quickly 1
though 1
were 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
muscles 1
wont 1
to 1
react 1
in 1
unison 1
to 1
the 1
slightest 1
alarm 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
upon 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
facing 1
his 1
enemies 1
even 1
as 1
he 1
realized 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
behind 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
the 1
warriors 1
leaped 1
toward 1
him 1
with 1
raised 1
clubs 1
and 1
savage 1
yells 1
but 1
the 1
foremost 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
sudden 1
death 1
beneath 1
the 1
long 1
stout 1
stick 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
lithe 1
sinewy 1
figure 1
was 1
among 1
them 1
striking 1
right 1
and 1
left 1
with 1
a 1
fury 1
power 1
and 1
precision 1
that 1
brought 1
panic 1
to 1
the 1
ranks 1
of 1
the 1
blacks 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
they 1
withdrew 1
those 1
that 1
were 1
left 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
consulted 1
together 1
at 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
who 1
stood 1
with 1
folded 1
arms 1
a 1
half 1
smile 1
upon 1
his 1
handsome 1
face 1
watching 1
them 1
presently 1
they 1
advanced 1
upon 1
him 1
once 1
more 1
this 1
time 1
wielding 1
their 1
heavy 1
war 1
spears 1
they 1
were 1
between 1
tarzan 1
and 1
the 1
jungle 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
semicircle 1
that 1
closed 1
in 1
upon 1
him 1
as 1
they 1
advanced 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
but 1
slight 1
chance 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
final 1
charge 1
when 1
all 1
the 1
great 1
spears 1
should 1
be 1
hurled 1
simultaneously 1
at 1
him 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
desired 1
to 1
escape 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
way 1
other 1
than 1
through 1
the 1
ranks 1
of 1
the 1
savages 1
except 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
behind 1
him 1
his 1
predicament 1
was 1
indeed 1
most 1
serious 1
when 1
an 1
idea 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
altered 1
his 1
smile 1
to 1
a 1
broad 1
grin 1
the 1
warriors 1
were 1
still 1
some 1
little 1
distance 1
away 1
advancing 1
slowly 1
making 1
after 1
the 1
manner 1
of 1
their 1
kind 1
a 1
frightful 1
din 1
with 1
their 1
savage 1
yells 1
and 1
the 1
pounding 1
of 1
their 1
naked 1
feet 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
as 1
they 1
leaped 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
a 1
fantastic 1
war 1
dance 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
lifted 1
his 1
voice 1
in 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
wild 1
weird 1
screams 1
that 1
brought 1
the 1
blacks 1
to 1
a 1
sudden 1
perplexed 1
halt 1
they 1
looked 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
questioningly 1
for 1
here 1
was 1
a 1
sound 1
so 1
hideous 1
that 1
their 1
own 1
frightful 1
din 1
faded 1
into 1
insignificance 1
beside 1
it 1
no 1
human 1
throat 1
could 1
have 1
formed 1
those 1
bestial 1
notes 1
they 1
were 1
sure 1
and 1
yet 1
with 1
their 1
own 1
eyes 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
this 1
white 1
man 1
open 1
his 1
mouth 1
to 1
pour 1
forth 1
his 1
awful 1
cry 1
but 1
only 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
they 1
hesitated 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
one 1
accord 1
they 1
again 1
took 1
up 1
their 1
fantastic 1
advance 1
upon 1
their 1
prey 1
but 1
even 1
then 1
a 1
sudden 1
crashing 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
behind 1
them 1
brought 1
them 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
a 1
halt 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
turned 1
to 1
look 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
this 1
new 1
noise 1
there 1
broke 1
upon 1
their 1
startled 1
visions 1
a 1
sight 1
that 1
may 1
well 1
have 1
frozen 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
braver 1
men 1
than 1
the 1
wagambi 1
leaping 1
from 1
the 1
tangled 1
vegetation 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
s 1
rim 1
came 1
a 1
huge 1
panther 1
with 1
blazing 1
eyes 1
and 1
bared 1
fangs 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
wake 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
mighty 1
shaggy 1
apes 1
lumbering 1
rapidly 1
toward 1
them 1
half 1
erect 1
upon 1
their 1
short 1
bowed 1
legs 1
and 1
with 1
their 1
long 1
arms 1
reaching 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
where 1
their 1
horny 1
knuckles 1
bore 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
their 1
ponderous 1
bodies 1
as 1
they 1
lurched 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
in 1
their 1
grotesque 1
advance 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
tarzan 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
his 1
call 1
before 1
the 1
wagambi 1
could 1
recover 1
from 1
their 1
astonishment 1
the 1
frightful 1
horde 1
was 1
upon 1
them 1
from 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
heavy 1
spears 1
were 1
hurled 1
and 1
mighty 1
war 1
clubs 1
wielded 1
and 1
though 1
apes 1
went 1
down 1
never 1
to 1
rise 1
so 1
too 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
ugambi 1
sheeta 1
s 1
cruel 1
fangs 1
and 1
tearing 1
talons 1
ripped 1
and 1
tore 1
at 1
the 1
black 1
hides 1
akut 1
s 1
mighty 1
yellow 1
tusks 1
found 1
the 1
jugular 1
of 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
sleek 1
skinned 1
savage 1
and 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
was 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
and 1
everywhere 1
urging 1
on 1
his 1
fierce 1
allies 1
and 1
taking 1
a 1
heavy 1
toll 1
with 1
his 1
long 1
slim 1
knife 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
blacks 1
had 1
scattered 1
for 1
their 1
lives 1
but 1
of 1
the 1
score 1
that 1
had 1
crept 1
down 1
the 1
grassy 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
promontory 1
only 1
a 1
single 1
warrior 1
managed 1
to 1
escape 1
the 1
horde 1
that 1
had 1
overwhelmed 1
his 1
people 1
this 1
one 1
was 1
mugambi 1
chief 1
of 1
the 1
wagambi 1
of 1
ugambi 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
disappeared 1
in 1
the 1
tangled 1
luxuriousness 1
of 1
the 1
rank 1
growth 1
upon 1
the 1
ridge 1
s 1
summit 1
only 1
the 1
keen 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
saw 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
his 1
flight 1
leaving 1
his 1
pack 1
to 1
eat 1
their 1
fill 1
upon 1
the 1
flesh 1
of 1
their 1
victims 1
flesh 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
touch 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
pursued 1
the 1
single 1
survivor 1
of 1
the 1
bloody 1
fray 1
just 1
beyond 1
the 1
ridge 1
he 1
came 1
within 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
fleeing 1
black 1
making 1
with 1
headlong 1
leaps 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
war 1
canoe 1
that 1
was 1
drawn 1
well 1
up 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
above 1
the 1
high 1
tide 1
surf 1
noiseless 1
as 1
the 1
fellow 1
s 1
shadow 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
raced 1
after 1
the 1
terror 1
stricken 1
black 1
in 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
s 1
mind 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
plan 1
awakened 1
by 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
war 1
canoe 1
if 1
these 1
men 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
his 1
island 1
from 1
another 1
or 1
from 1
the 1
mainland 1
why 1
not 1
utilize 1
their 1
craft 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
from 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
evidently 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
inhabited 1
country 1
and 1
no 1
doubt 1
had 1
occasional 1
intercourse 1
with 1
the 1
mainland 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
itself 1
upon 1
the 1
continent 1
of 1
africa 1
a 1
heavy 1
hand 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
shoulder 1
of 1
the 1
escaping 1
mugambi 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
pursued 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
do 1
battle 1
with 1
his 1
assailant 1
giant 1
fingers 1
closed 1
about 1
his 1
wrists 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
hurled 1
to 1
earth 1
with 1
a 1
giant 1
astride 1
him 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
strike 1
a 1
blow 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
defence 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
west 1
coast 1
tarzan 1
spoke 1
to 1
the 1
prostrate 1
man 1
beneath 1
him 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
he 1
asked 1
mugambi 1
chief 1
of 1
the 1
wagambi 1
replied 1
the 1
black 1
i 1
will 1
spare 1
your 1
life 1
said 1
tarzan 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
promise 1
to 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
leave 1
this 1
island 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
answer 1
i 1
will 1
help 1
you 1
replied 1
mugambi 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
killed 1
all 1
my 1
warriors 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
even 1
i 1
can 1
leave 1
your 1
country 1
for 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
none 1
to 1
wield 1
the 1
paddles 1
and 1
without 1
paddlers 1
we 1
cannot 1
cross 1
the 1
water 1
tarzan 1
rose 1
and 1
allowed 1
his 1
prisoner 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
the 1
fellow 1
was 1
a 1
magnificent 1
specimen 1
of 1
manhood 1
a 1
black 1
counterpart 1
in 1
physique 1
of 1
the 1
splendid 1
white 1
man 1
whom 1
he 1
faced 1
come 1
said 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
and 1
started 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
from 1
which 1
they 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
snarling 1
and 1
growling 1
of 1
the 1
feasting 1
pack 1
mugambi 1
drew 1
back 1
they 1
will 1
kill 1
us 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
think 1
not 1
replied 1
tarzan 1
they 1
are 1
mine 1
still 1
the 1
black 1
hesitated 1
fearful 1
of 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
approaching 1
the 1
terrible 1
creatures 1
that 1
were 1
dining 1
upon 1
the 1
bodies 1
of 1
his 1
warriors 1
but 1
tarzan 1
forced 1
him 1
to 1
accompany 1
him 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
two 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
jungle 1
in 1
full 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
grisly 1
spectacle 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
the 1
beasts 1
looked 1
up 1
with 1
menacing 1
growls 1
but 1
tarzan 1
strode 1
in 1
among 1
them 1
dragging 1
the 1
trembling 1
wagambi 1
with 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
taught 1
the 1
apes 1
to 1
accept 1
sheeta 1
so 1
he 1
taught 1
them 1
to 1
adopt 1
mugambi 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
much 1
more 1
easily 1
but 1
sheeta 1
seemed 1
quite 1
unable 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
devour 1
mugambi 1
s 1
warriors 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
proceed 1
after 1
the 1
same 1
fashion 1
with 1
mugambi 1
however 1
being 1
well 1
filled 1
he 1
contented 1
himself 1
with 1
walking 1
round 1
the 1
terror 1
stricken 1
savage 1
emitting 1
low 1
menacing 1
growls 1
the 1
while 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
flaming 1
baleful 1
eyes 1
riveted 1
upon 1
the 1
black 1
mugambi 1
on 1
his 1
part 1
clung 1
closely 1
to 1
tarzan 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
could 1
scarce 1
control 1
his 1
laughter 1
at 1
the 1
pitiable 1
condition 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
chief 1
s 1
fear 1
had 1
reduced 1
him 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
the 1
white 1
took 1
the 1
great 1
cat 1
by 1
the 1
scruff 1
of 1
the 1
neck 1
and 1
dragging 1
it 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
wagambi 1
slapped 1
it 1
sharply 1
upon 1
the 1
nose 1
each 1
time 1
that 1
it 1
growled 1
at 1
the 1
stranger 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
a 1
man 1
mauling 1
with 1
his 1
bare 1
hands 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
relentless 1
and 1
fierce 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
carnivora 1
mugambi 1
s 1
eyes 1
bulged 1
from 1
their 1
sockets 1
and 1
from 1
entertaining 1
a 1
sullen 1
respect 1
for 1
the 1
giant 1
white 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
prisoner 1
the 1
black 1
felt 1
an 1
almost 1
worshipping 1
awe 1
of 1
tarzan 1
the 1
education 1
of 1
sheeta 1
progressed 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
mugambi 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
his 1
hungry 1
attention 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
felt 1
a 1
degree 1
more 1
of 1
safety 1
in 1
his 1
society 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
mugambi 1
was 1
entirely 1
happy 1
or 1
at 1
ease 1
in 1
his 1
new 1
environment 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
to 1
adhere 1
strictly 1
to 1
the 1
truth 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
constantly 1
rolling 1
apprehensively 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
as 1
now 1
one 1
and 1
now 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
fierce 1
pack 1
chanced 1
to 1
wander 1
near 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
it 1
was 1
principally 1
the 1
whites 1
that 1
showed 1
together 1
tarzan 1
and 1
mugambi 1
with 1
sheeta 1
and 1
akut 1
lay 1
in 1
wait 1
at 1
the 1
ford 1
for 1
a 1
deer 1
and 1
when 1
at 1
a 1
word 1
from 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
the 1
four 1
of 1
them 1
leaped 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
affrighted 1
animal 1
the 1
black 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
creature 1
died 1
of 1
fright 1
before 1
ever 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
beasts 1
touched 1
it 1
mugambi 1
built 1
a 1
fire 1
and 1
cooked 1
his 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
kill 1
but 1
tarzan 1
sheeta 1
and 1
akut 1
tore 1
theirs 1
raw 1
with 1
their 1
sharp 1
teeth 1
growling 1
among 1
themselves 1
when 1
one 1
ventured 1
to 1
encroach 1
upon 1
the 1
share 1
of 1
another 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
after 1
all 1
strange 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
s 1
ways 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
nearly 1
related 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
beasts 1
than 1
were 1
the 1
savage 1
blacks 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
of 1
us 1
creatures 1
of 1
habit 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
seeming 1
necessity 1
for 1
schooling 1
ourselves 1
in 1
new 1
ways 1
ceases 1
to 1
exist 1
we 1
fall 1
naturally 1
and 1
easily 1
into 1
the 1
manners 1
and 1
customs 1
which 1
long 1
usage 1
has 1
implanted 1
ineradicably 1
within 1
us 1
mugambi 1
from 1
childhood 1
had 1
eaten 1
no 1
meat 1
until 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
cooked 1
while 1
tarzan 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
had 1
never 1
tasted 1
cooked 1
food 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
grown 1
almost 1
to 1
manhood 1
and 1
only 1
within 1
the 1
past 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
years 1
had 1
he 1
eaten 1
cooked 1
meat 1
not 1
only 1
did 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
a 1
lifetime 1
prompt 1
him 1
to 1
eat 1
it 1
raw 1
but 1
the 1
craving 1
of 1
his 1
palate 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
to 1
him 1
cooked 1
flesh 1
was 1
spoiled 1
flesh 1
when 1
compared 1
with 1
the 1
rich 1
and 1
juicy 1
meat 1
of 1
a 1
fresh 1
hot 1
kill 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
with 1
relish 1
eat 1
raw 1
meat 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
buried 1
by 1
himself 1
weeks 1
before 1
and 1
enjoy 1
small 1
rodents 1
and 1
disgusting 1
grubs 1
seems 1
to 1
us 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
always 1
civilized 1
a 1
revolting 1
fact 1
but 1
had 1
we 1
learned 1
in 1
childhood 1
to 1
eat 1
these 1
things 1
and 1
had 1
we 1
seen 1
all 1
those 1
about 1
us 1
eat 1
them 1
they 1
would 1
seem 1
no 1
more 1
sickening 1
to 1
us 1
now 1
than 1
do 1
many 1
of 1
our 1
greatest 1
dainties 1
at 1
which 1
a 1
savage 1
african 1
cannibal 1
would 1
look 1
with 1
repugnance 1
and 1
turn 1
up 1
his 1
nose 1
for 1
instance 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
tribe 1
in 1
the 1
vicinity 1
of 1
lake 1
rudolph 1
that 1
will 1
eat 1
no 1
sheep 1
or 1
cattle 1
though 1
its 1
next 1
neighbors 1
do 1
so 1
near 1
by 1
is 1
another 1
tribe 1
that 1
eats 1
donkey 1
meat 1
a 1
custom 1
most 1
revolting 1
to 1
the 1
surrounding 1
tribes 1
that 1
do 1
not 1
eat 1
donkey 1
so 1
who 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
nice 1
to 1
eat 1
snails 1
and 1
frogs 1
legs 1
and 1
oysters 1
but 1
disgusting 1
to 1
feed 1
upon 1
grubs 1
and 1
beetles 1
or 1
that 1
a 1
raw 1
oyster 1
hoof 1
horns 1
and 1
tail 1
is 1
less 1
revolting 1
than 1
the 1
sweet 1
clean 1
meat 1
of 1
a 1
fresh 1
killed 1
buck 1
the 1
next 1
few 1
days 1
tarzan 1
devoted 1
to 1
the 1
weaving 1
of 1
a 1
barkcloth 1
sail 1
with 1
which 1
to 1
equip 1
the 1
canoe 1
for 1
he 1
despaired 1
of 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
teach 1
the 1
apes 1
to 1
wield 1
the 1
paddles 1
though 1
he 1
did 1
manage 1
to 1
get 1
several 1
of 1
them 1
to 1
embark 1
in 1
the 1
frail 1
craft 1
which 1
he 1
and 1
mugambi 1
paddled 1
about 1
inside 1
the 1
reef 1
where 1
the 1
water 1
was 1
quite 1
smooth 1
during 1
these 1
trips 1
he 1
had 1
placed 1
paddles 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
when 1
they 1
attempted 1
to 1
imitate 1
the 1
movements 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
mugambi 1
but 1
so 1
difficult 1
is 1
it 1
for 1
them 1
long 1
to 1
concentrate 1
upon 1
a 1
thing 1
that 1
he 1
soon 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
require 1
weeks 1
of 1
patient 1
training 1
before 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
effective 1
use 1
of 1
these 1
new 1
implements 1
if 1
in 1
fact 1
they 1
should 1
ever 1
do 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
exception 1
however 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
akut 1
almost 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
he 1
showed 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
this 1
new 1
sport 1
that 1
revealed 1
a 1
much 1
higher 1
plane 1
of 1
intelligence 1
than 1
that 1
attained 1
by 1
any 1
of 1
his 1
tribe 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
grasp 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
the 1
paddles 1
and 1
when 1
tarzan 1
saw 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
so 1
he 1
took 1
much 1
pains 1
to 1
explain 1
in 1
the 1
meagre 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
anthropoid 1
how 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
used 1
to 1
the 1
best 1
advantage 1
from 1
mugambi 1
tarzan 1
learned 1
that 1
the 1
mainland 1
lay 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
island 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
the 1
wagambi 1
warriors 1
had 1
ventured 1
too 1
far 1
out 1
in 1
their 1
frail 1
craft 1
and 1
when 1
caught 1
by 1
a 1
heavy 1
tide 1
and 1
a 1
high 1
wind 1
from 1
off 1
shore 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
driven 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
of 1
land 1
after 1
paddling 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
night 1
thinking 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
headed 1
for 1
home 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
this 1
land 1
at 1
sunrise 1
and 1
still 1
taking 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
mainland 1
had 1
hailed 1
it 1
with 1
joy 1
nor 1
had 1
mugambi 1
been 1
aware 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
island 1
until 1
tarzan 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
fact 1
the 1
wagambi 1
chief 1
was 1
quite 1
dubious 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
sail 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
such 1
a 1
contrivance 1
used 1
his 1
country 1
lay 1
far 1
up 1
the 1
broad 1
ugambi 1
river 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
occasion 1
that 1
any 1
of 1
his 1
people 1
had 1
found 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
ocean 1
tarzan 1
however 1
was 1
confident 1
that 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
west 1
wind 1
he 1
could 1
navigate 1
the 1
little 1
craft 1
to 1
the 1
mainland 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
he 1
decided 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
preferable 1
to 1
perish 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
than 1
to 1
remain 1
indefinitely 1
upon 1
this 1
evidently 1
uncharted 1
island 1
to 1
which 1
no 1
ships 1
might 1
ever 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
fair 1
wind 1
rose 1
he 1
embarked 1
upon 1
his 1
cruise 1
and 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
took 1
as 1
strange 1
and 1

its 1

the 1
break 1

it 1

at 1

for 1
it 1
had 1
seemed 1
best 1
to 1
tarzan 1
always 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
wicked 1
beast 1
as 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
other 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
party 1
as 1
possible 1
since 1
it 1
would 1
require 1
little 1
or 1
no 1
provocation 1
to 1
send 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
throat 1
of 1
any 1
than 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
whom 1
he 1
evidently 1
now 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
his 1
master 1
in 1
the 1
stern 1
was 1
mugambi 1
and 1
just 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
squatted 1
akut 1
while 1
between 1
akut 1
and 1
tarzan 1
the 1
twelve 1
hairy 1
apes 1
sat 1
upon 1
their 1
haunches 1
blinking 1
dubiously 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
and 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
turning 1
their 1
eyes 1
longingly 1
back 1
toward 1
shore 1
all 1
went 1
well 1
until 1
the 1
canoe 1
had 1
passed 1
beyond 1
the 1
reef 1
here 1
the 1
breeze 1
struck 1
the 1
sail 1
sending 1
the 1
rude 1
craft 1
lunging 1
among 1
the 1
waves 1
that 1
ran 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
as 1
they 1
drew 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
with 1
the 1
tossing 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
the 1
apes 1
became 1
panic 1
stricken 1
they 1
first 1
moved 1
uneasily 1
about 1
and 1
then 1
commenced 1
grumbling 1
and 1
whining 1
with 1
difficulty 1
akut 1
kept 1
them 1
in 1
hand 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
but 1
when 1
a 1
particularly 1
large 1
wave 1
struck 1
the 1
dugout 1
simultaneously 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
squall 1
of 1
wind 1
their 1
terror 1
broke 1
all 1
bounds 1
and 1
leaping 1
to 1
their 1
feet 1
they 1
all 1
but 1
overturned 1
the 1
boat 1
before 1
akut 1
and 1
tarzan 1
together 1
could 1
quiet 1
them 1
at 1
last 1
calm 1
was 1
restored 1
and 1
eventually 1
the 1
apes 1
became 1
accustomed 1
to 1
the 1
strange 1
antics 1
of 1
their 1
craft 1
after 1
which 1
no 1
more 1
trouble 1
was 1
experienced 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
trip 1
was 1
uneventful 1
the 1
wind 1
held 1
and 1
after 1
ten 1
hours 1
steady 1
sailing 1
the 1
black 1
shadows 1
of 1
the 1
coast 1
loomed 1
close 1
before 1
the 1
straining 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
bow 1
it 1
was 1
far 1
too 1
dark 1
to 1
distinguish 1
whether 1
they 1
had 1
approached 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
or 1
not 1
so 1
tarzan 1
ran 1
in 1
through 1
the 1
surf 1
at 1
the 1
closest 1
point 1
to 1
await 1
the 1
dawn 1
the 1
dugout 1
turned 1
broadside 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
its 1
nose 1
touched 1
the 1
sand 1
and 1
immediately 1
it 1
rolled 1
over 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
crew 1
scrambling 1
madly 1
for 1
the 1
shore 1
the 1
next 1
breaker 1
rolled 1
them 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
but 1
eventually 1
they 1
all 1
succeeded 1
in 1
crawling 1
to 1
safety 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
more 1
their 1
ungainly 1
craft 1
had 1
been 1
washed 1
up 1
beside 1
them 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
apes 1
sat 1
huddled 1
close 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
for 1
warmth 1
while 1
mugambi 1
built 1
a 1
fire 1
close 1
to 1
them 1
over 1
which 1
he 1
crouched 1
tarzan 1
and 1
sheeta 1
however 1
were 1
of 1
a 1
different 1
mind 1
for 1
neither 1
of 1
them 1
feared 1
the 1
jungle 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
insistent 1
craving 1
of 1
their 1
hunger 1
sent 1
them 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
stygian 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
prey 1
side 1
by 1
side 1
they 1
walked 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
room 1
for 1
two 1
abreast 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
in 1
single 1
file 1
first 1
one 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
other 1
in 1
advance 1
it 1
was 1
tarzan 1
who 1
first 1
caught 1
the 1
scent 1
of 1
meat 1
a 1
bull 1
buffalo 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
two 1
came 1
stealthily 1
upon 1
the 1
sleeping 1
beast 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
dense 1
jungle 1
of 1
reeds 1
close 1
to 1
a 1
river 1
closer 1
and 1
closer 1
they 1
crept 1
toward 1
the 1
unsuspecting 1
beast 1
sheeta 1
upon 1
his 1
right 1
side 1
and 1
tarzan 1
upon 1
his 1
left 1
nearest 1
the 1
great 1
heart 1
they 1
had 1
hunted 1
together 1
now 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
worked 1
in 1
unison 1
with 1
only 1
low 1
purring 1
sounds 1
as 1
signals 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
they 1
lay 1
quite 1
silent 1
near 1
their 1
prey 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
a 1
sign 1
from 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
sheeta 1
sprang 1
upon 1
the 1
great 1
back 1
burying 1
his 1
strong 1
teeth 1
in 1
the 1
bull 1
s 1
neck 1
instantly 1
the 1
brute 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
with 1
a 1
bellow 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
rage 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
tarzan 1
rushed 1
in 1
upon 1
his 1
left 1
side 1
with 1
the 1
stone 1
knife 1
striking 1
repeatedly 1
behind 1
the 1
shoulder 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
hands 1
clutched 1
the 1
thick 1
mane 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
bull 1
raced 1
madly 1
through 1
the 1
reeds 1
the 1
thing 1
striking 1
at 1
his 1
life 1
was 1
dragged 1
beside 1
him 1
sheeta 1
but 1
clung 1
tenaciously 1
to 1
his 1
hold 1
upon 1
the 1
neck 1
and 1
back 1
biting 1
deep 1
in 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
spine 1
for 1
several 1
hundred 1
yards 1
the 1
bellowing 1
bull 1
carried 1
his 1
two 1
savage 1
antagonists 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
blade 1
found 1
his 1
heart 1
when 1
with 1
a 1
final 1
bellow 1
that 1
was 1
half 1
scream 1
he 1
plunged 1
headlong 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
then 1
tarzan 1
and 1
sheeta 1
feasted 1
to 1
repletion 1
after 1
the 1
meal 1
the 1
two 1
curled 1
up 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
thicket 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
black 1
head 1
pillowed 1
upon 1
the 1
tawny 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
shortly 1
after 1
dawn 1
they 1
awoke 1
and 1
ate 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
beach 1
that 1
tarzan 1
might 1
lead 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
to 1
the 1
kill 1
when 1
the 1
meal 1
was 1
done 1
the 1
brutes 1
were 1
for 1
curling 1
up 1
to 1
sleep 1
so 1
tarzan 1
and 1
mugambi 1
set 1
off 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
river 1
they 1
had 1
proceeded 1
scarce 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
when 1
they 1
came 1
suddenly 1
upon 1
a 1
broad 1
stream 1
which 1
the 1
negro 1
instantly 1
recognized 1
as 1
that 1
down 1
which 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
warriors 1
had 1
paddled 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
upon 1
their 1
ill 1
starred 1
expedition 1
the 1
two 1
now 1
followed 1
the 1
stream 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
ocean 1
finding 1
that 1
it 1
emptied 1
into 1
a 1
bay 1
not 1
over 1
a 1
mile 1
from 1
the 1
point 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
canoe 1
had 1
been 1
thrown 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
tarzan 1
was 1
much 1
elated 1
by 1
the 1
discovery 1
as 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
vicinity 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
watercourse 1
he 1
should 1
find 1
natives 1
and 1
from 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
he 1
had 1
little 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
obtain 1
news 1
of 1
rokoff 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
for 1
he 1
felt 1
reasonably 1
certain 1
that 1
the 1
russian 1
would 1
rid 1
himself 1
of 1
the 1
baby 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
after 1
having 1
disposed 1
of 1
tarzan 1
he 1
and 1
mugambi 1
now 1
righted 1
and 1
launched 1
the 1
dugout 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
difficult 1
feat 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
surf 1
which 1
rolled 1
continuously 1
in 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
were 1
successful 1
and 1
soon 1
after 1
were 1
paddling 1
up 1
the 1
coast 1
toward 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
here 1
they 1
experienced 1
considerable 1
difficulty 1
in 1
making 1
an 1
entrance 1
against 1
the 1
combined 1
current 1
and 1
ebb 1
tide 1
but 1
by 1
taking 1
advantage 1
of 1
eddies 1
close 1
in 1
to 1
shore 1
they 1
came 1
about 1
dusk 1
to 1
a 1
point 1
nearly 1
opposite 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
pack 1
asleep 1
making 1
the 1
craft 1
fast 1
to 1
an 1
overhanging 1
bough 1
the 1
two 1
made 1
their 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
presently 1
coming 1
upon 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
feeding 1
upon 1
fruit 1
a 1
little 1
beyond 1
the 1
reeds 1
where 1
the 1
buffalo 1
had 1
fallen 1
sheeta 1
was 1
not 1
anywhere 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
nor 1
did 1
he 1
return 1
that 1
night 1
so 1
that 1
tarzan 1
came 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
wandered 1
away 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
kind 1
early 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
led 1
his 1
band 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
he 1
gave 1
vent 1
to 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
shrill 1
cries 1
presently 1
from 1
a 1
great 1
distance 1
and 1
faintly 1
there 1
came 1
an 1
answering 1
scream 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
hour 1
later 1
the 1
lithe 1
form 1
of 1
sheeta 1
bounded 1
into 1
view 1
where 1
the 1
others 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
were 1
clambering 1
gingerly 1
into 1
the 1
canoe 1
the 1
great 1
beast 1
with 1
arched 1
back 1
and 1
purring 1
like 1
a 1
contented 1
tabby 1
rubbed 1
his 1
sides 1
against 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
a 1
word 1
from 1
the 1
latter 1
sprang 1
lightly 1
to 1
his 1
former 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
dugout 1
when 1
all 1
were 1
in 1
place 1
it 1
was 1
discovered 1
that 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
were 1
missing 1
and 1
though 1
both 1
the 1
king 1
ape 1
and 1
tarzan 1
called 1
to 1
them 1
for 1
the 1
better 1
part 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
response 1
and 1
finally 1
the 1
boat 1
put 1
off 1
without 1
them 1
as 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
missing 1
ones 1
were 1
the 1
very 1
same 1
who 1
had 1
evinced 1
the 1
least 1
desire 1
to 1
accompany 1
the 1
expedition 1
from 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
had 1
suffered 1
the 1
most 1
from 1
fright 1
during 1
the 1
voyage 1
tarzan 1
was 1
quite 1
sure 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
absented 1
themselves 1
purposely 1
rather 1
than 1
again 1
enter 1
the 1
canoe 1
as 1
the 1
party 1
were 1
putting 1
in 1
for 1
the 1
shore 1
shortly 1
after 1
noon 1
to 1
search 1
for 1
food 1
a 1
slender 1
naked 1
savage 1
watched 1
them 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
dense 1
screen 1
of 1
verdure 1
which 1
lined 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
bank 1
then 1
he 1
melted 1
away 1
up 1
stream 1
before 1
any 1
of 1
those 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
discovered 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
deer 1
he 1
bounded 1
along 1
the 1
narrow 1
trail 1
until 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
excitement 1
of 1
his 1
news 1
he 1
burst 1
into 1
a 1
native 1
village 1
several 1
miles 1
above 1
the 1
point 1
at 1
which 1
tarzan 1
and 1
his 1
pack 1
had 1
stopped 1
to 1
hunt 1
another 1
white 1
man 1
is 1
coming 1
he 1
cried 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
who 1
squatted 1
before 1
the 1
entrance 1
to 1
his 1
circular 1
hut 1
another 1
white 1
man 1
and 1
with 1
him 1
are 1
many 1
warriors 1
they 1
come 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
war 1
canoe 1
to 1
kill 1
and 1
rob 1
as 1
did 1
the 1
black 1
bearded 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
just 1
left 1
us 1
kaviri 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
recently 1
had 1
a 1
taste 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
s 1
medicine 1
and 1
his 1
savage 1
heart 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
bitterness 1
and 1
hate 1
in 1
another 1
moment 1
the 1
rumble 1
of 1
the 1
war 1
drums 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
calling 1
in 1
the 1
hunters 1
from 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
the 1
tillers 1
from 1
the 1
fields 1
seven 1
war 1
canoes 1
were 1
launched 1
and 1
manned 1
by 1
paint 1
daubed 1
befeathered 1
warriors 1
long 1
spears 1
bristled 1
from 1
the 1
rude 1
battle 1
ships 1
as 1
they 1
slid 1
noiselessly 1
over 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
propelled 1
by 1
giant 1
muscles 1
rolling 1
beneath 1
glistening 1
ebony 1
hides 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
beating 1
of 1
tom 1
toms 1
now 1
nor 1
blare 1
of 1
native 1
horn 1
for 1
kaviri 1
was 1
a 1
crafty 1
warrior 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
chances 1
if 1
they 1
could 1
be 1
avoided 1
he 1
would 1
swoop 1
noiselessly 1
down 1
with 1
his 1
seven 1
canoes 1
upon 1
the 1
single 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
guns 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
could 1
inflict 1
much 1
damage 1
upon 1
his 1
people 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
overwhelmed 1
the 1
enemy 1
by 1
force 1
of 1
numbers 1
kaviri 1
s 1
own 1
canoe 1
went 1
in 1
advance 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
rounded 1
a 1
sharp 1
bend 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
where 1
the 1
swift 1
current 1
bore 1
it 1
rapidly 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
it 1
came 1
suddenly 1
upon 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
kaviri 1
sought 1
so 1
close 1
were 1
the 1
two 1
canoes 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
that 1
the 1
black 1
had 1
only 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
note 1
the 1
white 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
oncoming 1
craft 1
before 1
the 1
two 1
touched 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
men 1
were 1
upon 1
their 1
feet 1
yelling 1
like 1
mad 1
devils 1
and 1
thrusting 1
their 1
long 1
spears 1
at 1
the 1
occupants 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
canoe 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
when 1
kaviri 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
realize 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
crew 1
that 1
manned 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
s 1
dugout 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
all 1
the 1
beads 1
and 1
iron 1
wire 1
that 1
he 1
possessed 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
safely 1
within 1
his 1
distant 1
village 1
scarcely 1
had 1
the 1
two 1
craft 1
come 1
together 1
than 1
the 1
frightful 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
rose 1
growling 1
and 1
barking 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
and 1
with 1
long 1
hairy 1
arms 1
far 1
outstretched 1
grasped 1
the 1
menacing 1
spears 1
from 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
kaviri 1
s 1
warriors 1
the 1
blacks 1
were 1
overcome 1
with 1
terror 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
other 1
than 1
to 1
fight 1
now 1
came 1
the 1
other 1
war 1
canoes 1
rapidly 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
two 1
craft 1
their 1
occupants 1
were 1
eager 1
to 1
join 1
the 1
battle 1
for 1
they 1
thought 1
that 1
their 1
foes 1
were 1
white 1
men 1
and 1
their 1
native 1
porters 1
they 1
swarmed 1
about 1
tarzan 1
s 1
craft 1
but 1
when 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
enemy 1
all 1
but 1
one 1
turned 1
and 1
paddled 1
swiftly 1
up 1
river 1
that 1
one 1
came 1
too 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
craft 1
before 1
its 1
occupants 1
realized 1
that 1
their 1
fellows 1
were 1
pitted 1
against 1
demons 1
instead 1
of 1
men 1
as 1
it 1
touched 1
tarzan 1
spoke 1
a 1
few 1
low 1
words 1
to 1
sheeta 1
and 1
akut 1
so 1
that 1
before 1
the 1
attacking 1
warriors 1
could 1
draw 1
away 1
there 1
sprang 1
upon 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
blood 1
freezing 1
scream 1
a 1
huge 1
panther 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
their 1
canoe 1
clambered 1
a 1
great 1
ape 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
the 1
panther 1
wrought 1
fearful 1
havoc 1
with 1
his 1
mighty 1
talons 1
and 1
long 1
sharp 1
fangs 1
while 1
akut 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
buried 1
his 1
yellow 1
canines 1
in 1
the 1
necks 1
of 1
those 1
that 1
came 1
within 1
his 1
reach 1
hurling 1
the 1
terror 1
stricken 1
blacks 1
overboard 1
as 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
toward 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
kaviri 1
was 1
so 1
busily 1
engaged 1
with 1
the 1
demons 1
that 1
had 1
entered 1
his 1
own 1
craft 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
offer 1
no 1
assistance 1
to 1
his 1
warriors 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
a 1
giant 1
of 1
a 1
white 1
devil 1
had 1
wrested 1
his 1
spear 1
from 1
him 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
the 1
mighty 1
kaviri 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
a 1
new 1
born 1
babe 1
hairy 1
monsters 1
were 1
overcoming 1
his 1
fighting 1
men 1
and 1
a 1
black 1
chieftain 1
like 1
himself 1
was 1
fighting 1
shoulder 1
to 1
shoulder 1
with 1
the 1
hideous 1
pack 1
that 1
opposed 1
him 1
kaviri 1
battled 1
bravely 1
against 1
his 1
antagonist 1
for 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
death 1
had 1
already 1
claimed 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
least 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
sell 1
his 1
life 1
as 1
dearly 1
as 1
possible 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
soon 1
evident 1
that 1
his 1
best 1
was 1
quite 1
futile 1
when 1
pitted 1
against 1
the 1
superhuman 1
brawn 1
and 1
agility 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
found 1
his 1
throat 1
and 1
bent 1
him 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
presently 1
kaviri 1
s 1
head 1
began 1
to 1
whirl 1
objects 1
became 1
confused 1
and 1
dim 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
pain 1
in 1
his 1
chest 1
as 1
he 1
struggled 1
for 1
the 1
breath 1
of 1
life 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
upon 1
him 1
was 1
shutting 1
off 1
for 1
ever 1
then 1
he 1
lost 1
consciousness 1
when 1
he 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes 1
once 1
more 1
he 1
found 1
much 1
to 1
his 1
surprise 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
dead 1
he 1
lay 1
securely 1
bound 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
canoe 1
a 1
great 1
panther 1
sat 1
upon 1
its 1
haunches 1
looking 1
down 1
upon 1
him 1
kaviri 1
shuddered 1
and 1
closed 1
his 1
eyes 1
again 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
ferocious 1
creature 1
to 1
spring 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
misery 1
of 1
terror 1
after 1
a 1
moment 1
no 1
rending 1
fangs 1
having 1
buried 1
themselves 1
in 1
his 1
trembling 1
body 1
he 1
again 1
ventured 1
to 1
open 1
his 1
eyes 1
beyond 1
the 1
panther 1
kneeled 1
the 1
white 1
giant 1
who 1
had 1
overcome 1
him 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
wielding 1
a 1
paddle 1
while 1
directly 1
behind 1
him 1
kaviri 1
saw 1
some 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
warriors 1
similarly 1
engaged 1
back 1
of 1
them 1
again 1
squatted 1
several 1
of 1
the 1
hairy 1
apes 1
tarzan 1
seeing 1
that 1
the 1
chief 1
had 1
regained 1
consciousness 1
addressed 1
him 1
your 1
warriors 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
chief 1
of 1
a 1
numerous 1
people 1
and 1
that 1
your 1
name 1
is 1
kaviri 1
he 1
said 1
yes 1
replied 1
the 1
black 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
attack 1
me 1
i 1
came 1
in 1
peace 1
another 1
white 1
man 1
came 1
in 1
peace 1
three 1
moons 1
ago 1
replied 1
kaviri 1
and 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
brought 1
him 1
presents 1
of 1
a 1
goat 1
and 1
cassava 1
and 1
milk 1
he 1
set 1
upon 1
us 1
with 1
his 1
guns 1
and 1
killed 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
people 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
taking 1
all 1
of 1
our 1
goats 1
and 1
many 1
of 1
our 1
young 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
as 1
this 1
other 1
white 1
man 1
replied 1
tarzan 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
harmed 1
you 1
had 1
you 1
not 1
set 1
upon 1
me 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
this 1
bad 1
white 1
man 1
like 1
i 1
am 1
searching 1
for 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
wronged 1
me 1
possibly 1
this 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
very 1
one 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
bad 1
face 1
covered 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
black 1
beard 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
very 1
wicked 1
yes 1
very 1
wicked 1
indeed 1
was 1
there 1
a 1
little 1
white 1
child 1
with 1
him 1
asked 1
tarzan 1
his 1
heart 1
almost 1
stopped 1
as 1
he 1
awaited 1
the 1
black 1
s 1
answer 1
no 1
bwana 1
replied 1
kaviri 1
the 1
white 1
child 1
was 1
not 1
with 1
this 1
man 1
s 1
party 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
party 1
other 1
party 1
exclaimed 1
tarzan 1
what 1
other 1
party 1
with 1
the 1
party 1
that 1
the 1
very 1
bad 1
white 1
man 1
was 1
pursuing 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
white 1
man 1
woman 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
with 1
six 1
mosula 1
porters 1
they 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
three 1
days 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
bad 1
white 1
man 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
running 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
a 1
white 1
man 1
woman 1
and 1
child 1
tarzan 1
was 1
puzzled 1
the 1
child 1
must 1
be 1
his 1
little 1
jack 1
but 1
who 1
could 1
the 1
woman 1
be 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
rokoff 1
s 1
confederates 1
had 1
conspired 1
with 1
some 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
accompanied 1
the 1
russian 1
to 1
steal 1
the 1
baby 1
from 1
him 1
if 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
case 1
they 1
had 1
doubtless 1
purposed 1
returning 1
the 1
child 1
to 1
civilization 1
and 1
there 1
either 1
claiming 1
a 1
reward 1
or 1
holding 1
the 1
little 1
prisoner 1
for 1
ransom 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
rokoff 1
had 1
succeeded 1
in 1
chasing 1
them 1
far 1
inland 1
up 1
the 1
savage 1
river 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
little 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
eventually 1
overhaul 1
them 1
unless 1
as 1
was 1
still 1
more 1
probable 1
they 1
should 1
be 1
captured 1
and 1
killed 1
by 1
the 1
very 1
cannibals 1
farther 1
up 1
the 1
ugambi 1
to 1
whom 1
tarzan 1
was 1
now 1
convinced 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
rokoff 1
s 1
intention 1
to 1
deliver 1
the 1
baby 1
as 1
he 1
talked 1
to 1
kaviri 1
the 1
canoes 1
had 1
been 1
moving 1
steadily 1
up 1
river 1
toward 1
the 1
chief 1
s 1
village 1
kaviri 1
s 1
warriors 1
plied 1
the 1
paddles 1
in 1
the 1
three 1
canoes 1
casting 1
sidelong 1
terrified 1
glances 1
at 1
their 1
hideous 1
passengers 1
three 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
had 1
been 1
killed 1
in 1
the 1
encounter 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
with 1
akut 1
eight 1
of 1
the 1
frightful 1
beasts 1
remaining 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
sheeta 1
the 1
panther 1
and 1
tarzan 1
and 1
mugambi 1
kaviri 1
s 1
warriors 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
so 1
terrible 1
a 1
crew 1
in 1
all 1
their 1
lives 1
momentarily 1
they 1
expected 1
to 1
be 1
pounced 1
upon 1
and 1
torn 1
asunder 1
by 1
some 1
of 1
their 1
captors 1
and 1
in 1
fact 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
tarzan 1
and 1
mugambi 1
and 1
akut 1
could 1
do 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
snarling 1
ill 1
natured 1
brutes 1
from 1
snapping 1
at 1
the 1
glistening 1
naked 1
bodies 1
that 1
brushed 1
against 1
them 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
the 1
movements 1
of 1
the 1
paddlers 1
whose 1
very 1
fear 1
added 1
incitement 1
to 1
the 1
beasts 1
at 1
kaviri 1
s 1
camp 1
tarzan 1
paused 1
only 1
long 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
food 1
that 1
the 1
blacks 1
furnished 1
and 1
arrange 1
with 1
the 1
chief 1
for 1
a 1
dozen 1
men 1
to 1
man 1
the 1
paddles 1
of 1
his 1
canoe 1
kaviri 1
was 1
only 1
too 1
glad 1
to 1
comply 1
with 1
any 1
demands 1
that 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
might 1
make 1
if 1
only 1
such 1
compliance 1
would 1
hasten 1
the 1
departure 1
of 1
the 1
horrid 1
pack 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
easier 1
he 1
discovered 1
to 1
promise 1
men 1
than 1
to 1
furnish 1
them 1
for 1
when 1
his 1
people 1
learned 1
his 1
intentions 1
those 1
that 1
had 1
not 1
already 1
fled 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
proceeded 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
without 1
loss 1
of 1
time 1
so 1
that 1
when 1
kaviri 1
turned 1
to 1
point 1
out 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
to 1
accompany 1
tarzan 1
he 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
member 1
of 1
his 1
tribe 1
left 1
within 1
the 1
village 1
tarzan 1
could 1
not 1
repress 1
a 1
smile 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
seem 1
anxious 1
to 1
accompany 1
us 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
just 1
remain 1
quietly 1
here 1
kaviri 1
and 1
presently 1
you 1
shall 1
see 1
your 1
people 1
flocking 1
to 1
your 1
side 1
then 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
rose 1
and 1
calling 1
his 1
pack 1
about 1
him 1
commanded 1
that 1
mugambi 1
remain 1
with 1
kaviri 1
and 1
disappeared 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
with 1
sheeta 1
and 1
the 1
apes 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
grim 1
forest 1
was 1
broken 1
only 1
by 1
the 1
ordinary 1
sounds 1
of 1
the 1
teeming 1
life 1
that 1
but 1
adds 1
to 1
its 1
lowering 1
loneliness 1
kaviri 1
and 1
mugambi 1
sat 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
palisaded 1
village 1
waiting 1
presently 1
from 1
a 1
great 1
distance 1
came 1
a 1
hideous 1
sound 1
mugambi 1
recognized 1
the 1
weird 1
challenge 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
immediately 1
from 1
different 1
points 1
of 1
the 1
compass 1
rose 1
a 1
horrid 1
semicircle 1
of 1
similar 1
shrieks 1
and 1
screams 1
punctuated 1
now 1
and 1
again 1
by 1
the 1
blood 1
curdling 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
hungry 1
panther 1
chapter 1

betrayed 1
the 1
two 1
savages 1
kaviri 1
and 1
mugambi 1
squatting 1
before 1
the 1
entrance 1
to 1
kaviri 1
s 1
hut 1
looked 1
at 1
one 1
another 1
kaviri 1
with 1
ill 1
concealed 1
alarm 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
he 1
whispered 1
it 1
is 1
bwana 1
tarzan 1
and 1
his 1
people 1
replied 1
mugambi 1
but 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
doing 1
i 1
know 1
not 1
unless 1
it 1
be 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
devouring 1
your 1
people 1
who 1
ran 1
away 1
kaviri 1
shuddered 1
and 1
rolled 1
his 1
eyes 1
fearfully 1
toward 1
the 1
jungle 1
in 1
all 1
his 1
long 1
life 1
in 1
the 1
savage 1
forest 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
heard 1
such 1
an 1
awful 1
fearsome 1
din 1
closer 1
and 1
closer 1
came 1
the 1
sounds 1
and 1
now 1
with 1
them 1
were 1
mingled 1
the 1
terrified 1
shrieks 1
of 1
women 1
and 1
children 1
and 1
of 1
men 1
for 1
twenty 1
long 1
minutes 1
the 1
blood 1
curdling 1
cries 1
continued 1
until 1
they 1
seemed 1
but 1
a 1
stone 1
s 1
throw 1
from 1
the 1
palisade 1
kaviri 1
rose 1
to 1
flee 1
but 1
mugambi 1
seized 1
and 1
held 1
him 1
for 1
such 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
command 1
of 1
tarzan 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
a 1
horde 1
of 1
terrified 1
natives 1
burst 1
from 1
the 1
jungle 1
racing 1
toward 1
the 1
shelter 1
of 1
their 1
huts 1
like 1
frightened 1
sheep 1
they 1
ran 1
and 1
behind 1
them 1
driving 1
them 1
as 1
sheep 1
might 1
be 1
driven 1
came 1
tarzan 1
and 1
sheeta 1
and 1
the 1
hideous 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
presently 1
tarzan 1
stood 1
before 1
kaviri 1
the 1
old 1
quiet 1
smile 1
upon 1
his 1
lips 1
your 1
people 1
have 1
returned 1
my 1
brother 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
now 1
you 1
may 1
select 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
to 1
accompany 1
me 1
and 1
paddle 1
my 1
canoe 1
tremblingly 1
kaviri 1
tottered 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
calling 1
to 1
his 1
people 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
their 1
huts 1
but 1
none 1
responded 1
to 1
his 1
summons 1
tell 1
them 1
suggested 1
tarzan 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
come 1
i 1
shall 1
send 1
my 1
people 1
in 1
after 1
them 1
kaviri 1
did 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
bid 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
entire 1
population 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
came 1
forth 1
their 1
wide 1
and 1
frightened 1
eyes 1
rolling 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
creatures 1
that 1
wandered 1
about 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
quickly 1
kaviri 1
designated 1
a 1
dozen 1
warriors 1
to 1
accompany 1
tarzan 1
the 1
poor 1
fellows 1
went 1
almost 1
white 1
with 1
terror 1
at 1
the 1
prospect 1
of 1
close 1
contact 1
with 1
the 1
panther 1
and 1
the 1
apes 1
in 1
the 1
narrow 1
confines 1
of 1
the 1
canoes 1
but 1
when 1
kaviri 1
explained 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
escape 1
that 1
bwana 1
tarzan 1
would 1
pursue 1
them 1
with 1
his 1
grim 1
horde 1
should 1
they 1
attempt 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
duty 1
they 1
finally 1
went 1
gloomily 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
places 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
that 1
their 1
chieftain 1
saw 1
the 1
party 1
disappear 1
about 1
a 1
headland 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
up 1
river 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
the 1
strange 1
company 1
continued 1
farther 1
and 1
farther 1
into 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
country 1
that 1
lies 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
almost 1
unexplored 1
ugambi 1
three 1
of 1
the 1
twelve 1
warriors 1
deserted 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
but 1
as 1
several 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
had 1
finally 1
learned 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
paddles 1
tarzan 1
felt 1
no 1
dismay 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
loss 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fact 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
travelled 1
much 1
more 1
rapidly 1
on 1
shore 1
but 1
he 1
believed 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hold 1
his 1
own 1
wild 1
crew 1
together 1
to 1
better 1
advantage 1
by 1
keeping 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
boat 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
possible 1
twice 1
a 1
day 1
they 1
landed 1
to 1
hunt 1
and 1
feed 1
and 1
at 1
night 1
they 1
slept 1
upon 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
the 1
mainland 1
or 1
on 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
numerous 1
little 1
islands 1
that 1
dotted 1
the 1
river 1
before 1
them 1
the 1
natives 1
fled 1
in 1
alarm 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
found 1
only 1
deserted 1
villages 1
in 1
their 1
path 1
as 1
they 1
proceeded 1
tarzan 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
get 1
in 1
touch 1
with 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
savages 1
who 1
dwelt 1
upon 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
banks 1
but 1
so 1
far 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
finally 1
he 1
decided 1
to 1
take 1
to 1
the 1
land 1
himself 1
leaving 1
his 1
company 1
to 1
follow 1
after 1
him 1
by 1
boat 1
he 1
explained 1
to 1
mugambi 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
in 1
mind 1
and 1
told 1
akut 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
directions 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
i 1
will 1
join 1
you 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
he 1
said 1
now 1
i 1
go 1
ahead 1
to 1
learn 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
bad 1
white 1
man 1
whom 1
i 1
seek 1
at 1
the 1
next 1
halt 1
tarzan 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
lost 1
to 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
his 1
people 1
the 1
first 1
few 1
villages 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
were 1
deserted 1
showing 1
that 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
his 1
pack 1
had 1
travelled 1
rapidly 1
but 1
toward 1
evening 1
he 1
came 1
upon 1
a 1
distant 1
cluster 1
of 1
thatched 1
huts 1
surrounded 1
by 1
a 1
rude 1
palisade 1
within 1
which 1
were 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hundred 1
natives 1
the 1
women 1
were 1
preparing 1
the 1
evening 1
meal 1
as 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
poised 1
above 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
a 1
giant 1
tree 1
which 1
overhung 1
the 1
palisade 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
was 1
at 1
a 1
loss 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
he 1
might 1
enter 1
into 1
communication 1
with 1
these 1
people 1
without 1
either 1
frightening 1
them 1
or 1
arousing 1
their 1
savage 1
love 1
of 1
battle 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
desire 1
to 1
fight 1
now 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
upon 1
a 1
much 1
more 1
important 1
mission 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
battling 1
with 1
every 1
chance 1
tribe 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
happen 1
to 1
meet 1
with 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
hit 1
upon 1
a 1
plan 1
and 1
after 1
seeing 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
concealed 1
from 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
those 1
below 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
few 1
hoarse 1
grunts 1
in 1
imitation 1
of 1
a 1
panther 1
all 1
eyes 1
immediately 1
turned 1
upward 1
toward 1
the 1
foliage 1
above 1
it 1
was 1
growing 1
dark 1
and 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
penetrate 1
the 1
leafy 1
screen 1
which 1
shielded 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
from 1
their 1
view 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
won 1
their 1
attention 1
he 1
raised 1
his 1
voice 1
to 1
the 1
shriller 1
and 1
more 1
hideous 1
scream 1
of 1
the 1
beast 1
he 1
personated 1
and 1
then 1
scarce 1
stirring 1
a 1
leaf 1
in 1
his 1
descent 1
dropped 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
once 1
again 1
outside 1
the 1
palisade 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
speed 1
of 1
a 1
deer 1
ran 1
quickly 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
gate 1
here 1
he 1
beat 1
upon 1
the 1
fibre 1
bound 1
saplings 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
barrier 1
was 1
constructed 1
shouting 1
to 1
the 1
natives 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
tongue 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
friend 1
who 1
wished 1
food 1
and 1
shelter 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
tarzan 1
knew 1
well 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
man 1
he 1
was 1
aware 1
that 1
the 1
grunting 1
and 1
screaming 1
of 1
sheeta 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
above 1
them 1
would 1
set 1
their 1
nerves 1
on 1
edge 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
pounding 1
upon 1
their 1
gate 1
after 1
dark 1
would 1
still 1
further 1
add 1
to 1
their 1
terror 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
reply 1
to 1
his 1
hail 1
was 1
no 1
surprise 1
for 1
natives 1
are 1
fearful 1
of 1
any 1
voice 1
that 1
comes 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
from 1
beyond 1
their 1
palisades 1
attributing 1
it 1
always 1
to 1
some 1
demon 1
or 1
other 1
ghostly 1
visitor 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
continued 1
to 1
call 1
let 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
friends 1
he 1
cried 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
white 1
man 1
pursuing 1
the 1
very 1
bad 1
white 1
man 1
who 1
passed 1
this 1
way 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
ago 1
i 1
follow 1
to 1
punish 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
sins 1
he 1
has 1
committed 1
against 1
you 1
and 1
me 1
if 1
you 1
doubt 1
my 1
friendship 1
i 1
will 1
prove 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
tree 1
above 1
your 1
village 1
and 1
driving 1
sheeta 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
before 1
he 1
leaps 1
among 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
promise 1
to 1
take 1
me 1
in 1
and 1
treat 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
friend 1
i 1
shall 1
let 1
sheeta 1
stay 1
and 1
devour 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
there 1
was 1
silence 1
then 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
came 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
quiet 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
indeed 1
a 1
white 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
friend 1
we 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
come 1
in 1
but 1
first 1
you 1
must 1
drive 1
sheeta 1
away 1
very 1
well 1
replied 1
tarzan 1
listen 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
hear 1
sheeta 1
fleeing 1
before 1
me 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
returned 1
quickly 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
great 1
noise 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
branches 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
growling 1
ominously 1
after 1
the 1
manner 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
so 1
that 1
those 1
below 1
would 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
beast 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
a 1
point 1
well 1
above 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
great 1
commotion 1
shaking 1
the 1
tree 1
violently 1
crying 1
aloud 1
to 1
the 1
panther 1
to 1
flee 1
or 1
be 1
killed 1
and 1
punctuating 1
his 1
own 1
voice 1
with 1
the 1
screams 1
and 1
mouthings 1
of 1
an 1
angry 1
beast 1
presently 1
he 1
raced 1
toward 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
and 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
pounding 1
loudly 1
against 1
the 1
boles 1
of 1
trees 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
and 1
voicing 1
the 1
panther 1
s 1
diminishing 1
growls 1
as 1
he 1
drew 1
farther 1
and 1
farther 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
he 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
gate 1
calling 1
to 1
the 1
natives 1
within 1
i 1
have 1
driven 1
sheeta 1
away 1
he 1
said 1
now 1
come 1
and 1
admit 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
promised 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
excited 1
discussion 1
within 1
the 1
palisade 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
a 1
half 1
dozen 1
warriors 1
came 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
gates 1
peering 1
anxiously 1
out 1
in 1
evident 1
trepidation 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
which 1
they 1
should 1
find 1
waiting 1
there 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
much 1
relieved 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
an 1
almost 1
naked 1
white 1
man 1
but 1
when 1
tarzan 1
had 1
reassured 1
them 1
in 1
quiet 1
tones 1
protesting 1
his 1
friendship 1
for 1
them 1
they 1
opened 1
the 1
barrier 1
a 1
trifle 1
farther 1
and 1
admitted 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
gates 1
had 1
been 1
once 1
more 1
secured 1
the 1
self 1
confidence 1
of 1
the 1
savages 1
returned 1
and 1
as 1
tarzan 1
walked 1
up 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
toward 1
the 1
chief 1
s 1
hut 1
he 1
was 1
surrounded 1
by 1
a 1
host 1
of 1
curious 1
men 1
women 1
and 1
children 1
from 1
the 1
chief 1
he 1
learned 1
that 1
rokoff 1
had 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
a 1
week 1
previous 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
horns 1
growing 1
from 1
his 1
forehead 1
and 1
was 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
thousand 1
devils 1
later 1
the 1
chief 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
very 1
bad 1
white 1
man 1
had 1
remained 1
a 1
month 1
in 1
his 1
village 1
though 1
none 1
of 1
these 1
statements 1
agreed 1
with 1
kaviri 1
s 1
that 1
the 1
russian 1
was 1
but 1
three 1
days 1
gone 1
from 1
the 1
chieftain 1
s 1
village 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
following 1
was 1
much 1
smaller 1
than 1
now 1
stated 1
tarzan 1
was 1
in 1
no 1
manner 1
surprised 1
at 1
the 1
discrepancies 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
familiar 1
with 1
the 1
savage 1
mind 1
s 1
strange 1
manner 1
of 1
functioning 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
most 1
interested 1
in 1
knowing 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
trail 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
led 1
toward 1
the 1
interior 1
in 1
this 1
circumstance 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
rokoff 1
could 1
never 1
escape 1
him 1
after 1
several 1
hours 1
of 1
questioning 1
and 1
cross 1
questioning 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
learned 1
that 1
another 1
party 1
had 1
preceded 1
the 1
russian 1
by 1
several 1
days 1
three 1
whites 1
a 1
man 1
a 1
woman 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
man 1
child 1
with 1
several 1
mosulas 1
tarzan 1
explained 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
that 1
his 1
people 1
would 1
follow 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
canoe 1
probably 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
though 1
he 1
might 1
go 1
on 1
ahead 1
of 1
them 1
the 1
chief 1
was 1
to 1
receive 1
them 1
kindly 1
and 1
have 1
no 1
fear 1
of 1
them 1
for 1
mugambi 1
would 1
see 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
harm 1
the 1
chief 1
s 1
people 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
accorded 1
a 1
friendly 1
reception 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
concluded 1
i 1
shall 1
lie 1
down 1
beneath 1
this 1
tree 1
and 1
sleep 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
tired 1
permit 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
disturb 1
me 1
the 1
chief 1
offered 1
him 1
a 1
hut 1
but 1
tarzan 1
from 1
past 1
experience 1
of 1
native 1
dwellings 1
preferred 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
and 1
further 1
he 1
had 1
plans 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
better 1
carried 1
out 1
if 1
he 1
remained 1
beneath 1
the 1
tree 1
he 1
gave 1
as 1
his 1
reason 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
be 1
close 1
at 1
hand 1
should 1
sheeta 1
return 1
and 1
after 1
this 1
explanation 1
the 1
chief 1
was 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
sleep 1
beneath 1
the 1
tree 1
tarzan 1
had 1
always 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
stood 1
him 1
in 1
good 1
stead 1
to 1
leave 1
with 1
natives 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
some 1
extent 1
possessed 1
of 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
miraculous 1
powers 1
he 1
might 1
easily 1
have 1
entered 1
their 1
village 1
without 1
recourse 1
to 1
the 1
gates 1
but 1
he 1
believed 1
that 1
a 1
sudden 1
and 1
unaccountable 1
disappearance 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
leave 1
them 1
would 1
result 1
in 1
a 1
more 1
lasting 1
impression 1
upon 1
their 1
childlike 1
minds 1
and 1
so 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
village 1
was 1
quiet 1
in 1
sleep 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
leaping 1
into 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
the 1
tree 1
above 1
him 1
faded 1
silently 1
into 1
the 1
black 1
mystery 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
night 1
all 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
swung 1
rapidly 1
through 1
the 1
upper 1
and 1
middle 1
terraces 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
when 1
the 1
going 1
was 1
good 1
there 1
he 1
preferred 1
the 1
upper 1
branches 1
of 1
the 1
giant 1
trees 1
for 1
then 1
his 1
way 1
was 1
better 1
lighted 1
by 1
the 1
moon 1
but 1
so 1
accustomed 1
were 1
all 1
his 1
senses 1
to 1
the 1
grim 1
world 1
of 1
his 1
birth 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
for 1
him 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
dense 1
black 1
shadows 1
near 1
the 1
ground 1
to 1
move 1
with 1
ease 1
and 1
rapidity 1
you 1
or 1
i 1
walking 1
beneath 1
the 1
arcs 1
of 1
main 1
street 1
or 1
broadway 1
or 1
state 1
street 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
moved 1
more 1
surely 1
or 1
with 1
a 1
tenth 1
the 1
speed 1
of 1
the 1
agile 1
ape 1
man 1
through 1
the 1
gloomy 1
mazes 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
baffled 1
us 1
entirely 1
at 1
dawn 1
he 1
stopped 1
to 1
feed 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
slept 1
for 1
several 1
hours 1
taking 1
up 1
the 1
pursuit 1
again 1
toward 1
noon 1
twice 1
he 1
came 1
upon 1
natives 1
and 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
considerable 1
difficulty 1
in 1
approaching 1
them 1
he 1
succeeded 1
in 1
each 1
instance 1
in 1
quieting 1
both 1
their 1
fears 1
and 1
bellicose 1
intentions 1
toward 1
him 1
and 1
learned 1
from 1
them 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
trail 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
two 1
days 1
later 1
still 1
following 1
up 1
the 1
ugambi 1
he 1
came 1
upon 1
a 1
large 1
village 1
the 1
chief 1
a 1
wicked 1
looking 1
fellow 1
with 1
the 1
sharp 1
filed 1
teeth 1
that 1
often 1
denote 1
the 1
cannibal 1
received 1
him 1
with 1
apparent 1
friendliness 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
was 1
now 1
thoroughly 1
fatigued 1
and 1
had 1
determined 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
eight 1
or 1
ten 1
hours 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
fresh 1
and 1
strong 1
when 1
he 1
caught 1
up 1
with 1
rokoff 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
he 1
must 1
do 1
within 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
time 1
the 1
chief 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
bearded 1
white 1
man 1
had 1
left 1
his 1
village 1
only 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
and 1
that 1
doubtless 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
overtake 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
the 1
other 1
party 1
the 1
chief 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
or 1
heard 1
of 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
tarzan 1
did 1
not 1
like 1
the 1
appearance 1
or 1
manner 1
of 1
the 1
fellow 1
who 1
seemed 1
though 1
friendly 1
enough 1
to 1
harbour 1
a 1
certain 1
contempt 1
for 1
this 1
half 1
naked 1
white 1
man 1
who 1
came 1
with 1
no 1
followers 1
and 1
offered 1
no 1
presents 1
but 1
he 1
needed 1
the 1
rest 1
and 1
food 1
that 1
the 1
village 1
would 1
afford 1
him 1
with 1
less 1
effort 1
than 1
the 1
jungle 1
and 1
so 1
as 1
he 1
knew 1
no 1
fear 1
of 1
man 1
beast 1
or 1
devil 1
he 1
curled 1
himself 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
hut 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
asleep 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
chief 1
than 1
the 1
latter 1
called 1
two 1
of 1
his 1
warriors 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
whispered 1
a 1
few 1
instructions 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
sleek 1
black 1
bodies 1
were 1
racing 1
along 1
the 1
river 1
path 1
up 1
stream 1
toward 1
the 1
east 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
chief 1
maintained 1
perfect 1
quiet 1
he 1
would 1
permit 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
approach 1
the 1
sleeping 1
visitor 1
nor 1
any 1
singing 1
nor 1
loud 1
talking 1
he 1
was 1
remarkably 1
solicitous 1
lest 1
his 1
guest 1
be 1
disturbed 1
three 1
hours 1
later 1
several 1
canoes 1
came 1
silently 1
into 1
view 1
from 1
up 1
the 1
ugambi 1
they 1
were 1
being 1
pushed 1
ahead 1
rapidly 1
by 1
the 1
brawny 1
muscles 1
of 1
their 1
black 1
crews 1
upon 1
the 1
bank 1
before 1
the 1
river 1
stood 1
the 1
chief 1
his 1
spear 1
raised 1
in 1
a 1
horizontal 1
position 1
above 1
his 1
head 1
as 1
though 1
in 1
some 1
manner 1
of 1
predetermined 1
signal 1
to 1
those 1
within 1
the 1
boats 1
and 1
such 1
indeed 1
was 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
his 1
attitude 1
which 1
meant 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
stranger 1
within 1
his 1
village 1
still 1
slept 1
peacefully 1
in 1
the 1
bows 1
of 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
canoes 1
were 1
the 1
runners 1
that 1
the 1
chief 1
had 1
sent 1
forth 1
three 1
hours 1
earlier 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
dispatched 1
to 1
follow 1
and 1
bring 1
back 1
this 1
party 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
signal 1
from 1
the 1
bank 1
was 1
one 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
determined 1
upon 1
before 1
they 1
left 1
the 1
village 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
the 1
dugouts 1
drew 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
verdure 1
clad 1
bank 1
the 1
native 1
warriors 1
filed 1
out 1
and 1
with 1
them 1
a 1
half 1
dozen 1
white 1
men 1
sullen 1
ugly 1
looking 1
customers 1
they 1
were 1
and 1
none 1
more 1
so 1
than 1
the 1
evil 1
faced 1
black 1
bearded 1
man 1
who 1
commanded 1
them 1
where 1
is 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
your 1
messengers 1
report 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
he 1
asked 1
of 1
the 1
chief 1
this 1
way 1
bwana 1
replied 1
the 1
native 1
carefully 1
have 1
i 1
kept 1
silence 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
still 1
asleep 1
when 1
you 1
returned 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
one 1
who 1
seeks 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
you 1
harm 1
but 1
he 1
questioned 1
me 1
closely 1
about 1
your 1
coming 1
and 1
your 1
going 1
and 1
his 1
appearance 1
is 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
you 1
described 1
but 1
whom 1
you 1
believed 1
safe 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
which 1
you 1
called 1
jungle 1
island 1
had 1
you 1
not 1
told 1
me 1
this 1
tale 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
recognized 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
gone 1
after 1
and 1
slain 1
you 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
friend 1
and 1
no 1
enemy 1
then 1
no 1
harm 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
bwana 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
proves 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
enemy 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
very 1
much 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
rifle 1
and 1
some 1
ammunition 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
well 1
replied 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
the 1
rifle 1
and 1
ammunition 1
whether 1
he 1
be 1
a 1
friend 1
or 1
enemy 1
provided 1
that 1
you 1
stand 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
shall 1
stand 1
with 1
you 1
bwana 1
said 1
the 1
chief 1
and 1
now 1
come 1
and 1
look 1
upon 1
the 1
stranger 1
who 1
sleeps 1
within 1
my 1
village 1
so 1
saying 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
led 1
the 1
way 1
toward 1
the 1
hut 1
in 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
unconscious 1
tarzan 1
slept 1
peacefully 1
behind 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
came 1
the 1
remaining 1
whites 1
and 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
warriors 1
but 1
the 1
raised 1
forefingers 1
of 1
the 1
chief 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
held 1
them 1
all 1
to 1
perfect 1
silence 1
as 1
they 1
turned 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
cautiously 1
and 1
upon 1
tiptoe 1
an 1
ugly 1
smile 1
touched 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
as 1
his 1
eyes 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
giant 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
sleeping 1
ape 1
man 1
the 1
chief 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
inquiringly 1
the 1
latter 1
nodded 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
signify 1
that 1
the 1
chief 1
had 1
made 1
no 1
mistake 1
in 1
his 1
suspicions 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
those 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
pointing 1
to 1
the 1
sleeping 1
man 1
motioned 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
seize 1
and 1
bind 1
him 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
a 1
dozen 1
brutes 1
had 1
leaped 1
upon 1
the 1
surprised 1
tarzan 1
and 1
so 1
quickly 1
did 1
they 1
work 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
securely 1
bound 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
make 1
half 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
escape 1
then 1
they 1
threw 1
him 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
and 1
as 1
his 1
eyes 1
turned 1
toward 1
the 1
crowd 1
that 1
stood 1
near 1
they 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
malign 1
face 1
of 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
a 1
sneer 1
curled 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
lips 1
he 1
stepped 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
tarzan 1
pig 1
he 1
cried 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
learned 1
sufficient 1
wisdom 1
to 1
keep 1
away 1
from 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
then 1
he 1
kicked 1
the 1
prostrate 1
man 1
full 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
that 1
for 1
your 1
welcome 1
he 1
said 1
tonight 1
before 1
my 1
ethiop 1
friends 1
eat 1
you 1
i 1
shall 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
has 1
already 1
befallen 1
your 1
wife 1
and 1
child 1
and 1
what 1
further 1
plans 1

8 1
the 1
dance 1
of 1
death 1
through 1
the 1
luxuriant 1
tangled 1
vegetation 1
of 1
the 1
stygian 1
jungle 1
night 1
a 1
great 1
lithe 1
body 1
made 1
its 1
way 1
sinuously 1
and 1
in 1
utter 1
silence 1
upon 1
its 1
soft 1
padded 1
feet 1
only 1
two 1
blazing 1
points 1
of 1
yellow 1
green 1
flame 1
shone 1
occasionally 1
with 1
the 1
reflected 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
equatorial 1
moon 1
that 1
now 1
and 1
again 1
pierced 1
the 1
softly 1
sighing 1
roof 1
rustling 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
wind 1
occasionally 1
the 1
beast 1
would 1
stop 1
with 1
high 1
held 1
nose 1
sniffing 1
searchingly 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
a 1
quick 1
brief 1
incursion 1
into 1
the 1
branches 1
above 1
delayed 1
it 1
momentarily 1
in 1
its 1
steady 1
journey 1
toward 1
the 1
east 1
to 1
its 1
sensitive 1
nostrils 1
came 1
the 1
subtle 1
unseen 1
spoor 1
of 1
many 1
a 1
tender 1
four 1
footed 1
creature 1
bringing 1
the 1
slaver 1
of 1
hunger 1
to 1
the 1
cruel 1
drooping 1
jowl 1
but 1
steadfastly 1
it 1
kept 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
strangely 1
ignoring 1
the 1
cravings 1
of 1
appetite 1
that 1
at 1
another 1
time 1
would 1
have 1
sent 1
the 1
rolling 1
fur 1
clad 1
muscles 1
flying 1
at 1
some 1
soft 1
throat 1
all 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
creature 1
pursued 1
its 1
lonely 1
way 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
it 1
halted 1
only 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
single 1
kill 1
which 1
it 1
tore 1
to 1
fragments 1
and 1
devoured 1
with 1
sullen 1
grumbling 1
rumbles 1
as 1
though 1
half 1
famished 1
for 1
lack 1
of 1
food 1
it 1
was 1
dusk 1
when 1
it 1
approached 1
the 1
palisade 1
that 1
surrounded 1
a 1
large 1
native 1
village 1
like 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
swift 1
and 1
silent 1
death 1
it 1
circled 1
the 1
village 1
nose 1
to 1
ground 1
halting 1
at 1
last 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
palisade 1
where 1
it 1
almost 1
touched 1
the 1
backs 1
of 1
several 1
huts 1
here 1
the 1
beast 1
sniffed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
turning 1
its 1
head 1
upon 1
one 1
side 1
listened 1
with 1
up 1
pricked 1
ears 1
what 1
it 1
heard 1
was 1
no 1
sound 1
by 1
the 1
standards 1
of 1
human 1
ears 1
yet 1
to 1
the 1
highly 1
attuned 1
and 1
delicate 1
organs 1
of 1
the 1
beast 1
a 1
message 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
borne 1
to 1
the 1
savage 1
brain 1
a 1
wondrous 1
transformation 1
was 1
wrought 1
in 1
the 1
motionless 1
mass 1
of 1
statuesque 1
bone 1
and 1
muscle 1
that 1
had 1
an 1
instant 1
before 1
stood 1
as 1
though 1
carved 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
bronze 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
poised 1
upon 1
steel 1
springs 1
suddenly 1
released 1
it 1
rose 1
quickly 1
and 1
silently 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
palisade 1
disappearing 1
stealthily 1
and 1
cat 1
like 1
into 1
the 1
dark 1
space 1
between 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
an 1
adjacent 1
hut 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
beyond 1
women 1
were 1
preparing 1
many 1
little 1
fires 1
and 1
fetching 1
cooking 1
pots 1
filled 1
with 1
water 1
for 1
a 1
great 1
feast 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
celebrated 1
ere 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
many 1
hours 1
older 1
about 1
a 1
stout 1
stake 1
near 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
circling 1
fires 1
a 1
little 1
knot 1
of 1
black 1
warriors 1
stood 1
conversing 1
their 1
bodies 1
smeared 1
with 1
white 1
and 1
blue 1
and 1
ochre 1
in 1
broad 1
and 1
grotesque 1
bands 1
great 1
circles 1
of 1
colour 1
were 1
drawn 1
about 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
lips 1
their 1
breasts 1
and 1
abdomens 1
and 1
from 1
their 1
clay 1
plastered 1
coiffures 1
rose 1
gay 1
feathers 1
and 1
bits 1
of 1
long 1
straight 1
wire 1
the 1
village 1
was 1
preparing 1
for 1
the 1
feast 1
while 1
in 1
a 1
hut 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
orgy 1
the 1
bound 1
victim 1
of 1
their 1
bestial 1
appetites 1
lay 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
end 1
and 1
such 1
an 1
end 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
tensing 1
his 1
mighty 1
muscles 1
strained 1
at 1
the 1
bonds 1
that 1
pinioned 1
him 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
re 1
enforced 1
many 1
times 1
at 1
the 1
instigation 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
so 1
that 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
giant 1
brawn 1
could 1
budge 1
them 1
death 1
tarzan 1
had 1
looked 1
the 1
hideous 1
hunter 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
smiled 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
smile 1
again 1
tonight 1
when 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
end 1
was 1
coming 1
quickly 1
but 1
now 1
his 1
thoughts 1
were 1
not 1
of 1
himself 1
but 1
of 1
those 1
others 1
the 1
dear 1
ones 1
who 1
must 1
suffer 1
most 1
because 1
of 1
his 1
passing 1
jane 1
would 1
never 1
know 1
the 1
manner 1
of 1
it 1
for 1
that 1
he 1
thanked 1
heaven 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
thankful 1
also 1
that 1
she 1
at 1
least 1
was 1
safe 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
s 1
greatest 1
city 1
safe 1
among 1
kind 1
and 1
loving 1
friends 1
who 1
would 1
do 1
their 1
best 1
to 1
lighten 1
her 1
misery 1
but 1
the 1
boy 1
tarzan 1
writhed 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
him 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
the 1
mighty 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
he 1
tarzan 1
king 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
fitted 1
to 1
find 1
and 1
save 1
the 1
child 1
from 1
the 1
horrors 1
that 1
rokoff 1
s 1
evil 1
mind 1
had 1
planned 1
had 1
been 1
trapped 1
like 1
a 1
silly 1
dumb 1
creature 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
die 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
and 1
with 1
him 1
would 1
go 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
last 1
chance 1
of 1
succour 1
rokoff 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
to 1
see 1
and 1
revile 1
and 1
abuse 1
him 1
several 1
times 1
during 1
the 1
afternoon 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
wring 1
no 1
word 1
of 1
remonstrance 1
or 1
murmur 1
of 1
pain 1
from 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
giant 1
captive 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
reserving 1
his 1
particular 1
bit 1
of 1
exquisite 1
mental 1
torture 1
for 1
the 1
last 1
moment 1
when 1
just 1
before 1
the 1
savage 1
spears 1
of 1
the 1
cannibals 1
should 1
for 1
ever 1
make 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
his 1
hatred 1
immune 1
to 1
further 1
suffering 1
the 1
russian 1
planned 1
to 1
reveal 1
to 1
his 1
enemy 1
the 1
true 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
his 1
wife 1
whom 1
he 1
thought 1
safe 1
in 1
england 1
dusk 1
had 1
fallen 1
upon 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
the 1
ape 1
men 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
preparations 1
going 1
forward 1
for 1
the 1
torture 1
and 1
the 1
feast 1
the 1
dance 1
of 1
death 1
he 1
could 1
picture 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
s 1
eye 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
thing 1
many 1
times 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
central 1
figure 1
bound 1
to 1
the 1
stake 1
the 1
torture 1
of 1
the 1
slow 1
death 1
as 1
the 1
circling 1
warriors 1
cut 1
him 1
to 1
bits 1
with 1
the 1
fiendish 1
skill 1
that 1
mutilated 1
without 1
bringing 1
unconsciousness 1
had 1
no 1
terrors 1
for 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
inured 1
to 1
suffering 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
blood 1
and 1
to 1
cruel 1
death 1
but 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
live 1
was 1
no 1
less 1
strong 1
within 1
him 1
and 1
until 1
the 1
last 1
spark 1
of 1
life 1
should 1
flicker 1
and 1
go 1
out 1
his 1
whole 1
being 1
would 1
remain 1
quick 1
with 1
hope 1
and 1
determination 1
let 1
them 1
relax 1
their 1
watchfulness 1
but 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
his 1
cunning 1
mind 1
and 1
giant 1
muscles 1
would 1
find 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
escape 1
escape 1
and 1
revenge 1
as 1
he 1
lay 1
thinking 1
furiously 1
on 1
every 1
possibility 1
of 1
self 1
salvation 1
there 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
sensitive 1
nostrils 1
a 1
faint 1
and 1
a 1
familiar 1
scent 1
instantly 1
every 1
faculty 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
alert 1
presently 1
his 1
trained 1
ears 1
caught 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
soundless 1
presence 1
without 1
behind 1
the 1
hut 1
wherein 1
he 1
lay 1
his 1
lips 1
moved 1
and 1
though 1
no 1
sound 1
came 1
forth 1
that 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
appreciable 1
to 1
a 1
human 1
ear 1
beyond 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
his 1
prison 1
yet 1
he 1
realized 1
that 1
the 1
one 1
beyond 1
would 1
hear 1
already 1
he 1
knew 1
who 1
that 1
one 1
was 1
for 1
his 1
nostrils 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
as 1
plainly 1
as 1
your 1
eyes 1
or 1
mine 1
tell 1
us 1
of 1
the 1
identity 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
friend 1
whom 1
we 1
come 1
upon 1
in 1
broad 1
daylight 1
an 1
instant 1
later 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
soft 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
fur 1
clad 1
body 1
and 1
padded 1
feet 1
scaling 1
the 1
outer 1
wall 1
behind 1
the 1
hut 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
tearing 1
at 1
the 1
poles 1
which 1
formed 1
the 1
wall 1
presently 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
thus 1
made 1
slunk 1
a 1
great 1
beast 1
pressing 1
its 1
cold 1
muzzle 1
close 1
to 1
his 1
neck 1
it 1
was 1
sheeta 1
the 1
panther 1
the 1
beast 1
snuffed 1
round 1
the 1
prostrate 1
man 1
whining 1
a 1
little 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
limit 1
to 1
the 1
interchange 1
of 1
ideas 1
which 1
could 1
take 1
place 1
between 1
these 1
two 1
and 1
so 1
tarzan 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
sure 1
that 1
sheeta 1
understood 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
attempted 1
to 1
communicate 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
tied 1
and 1
helpless 1
sheeta 1
could 1
of 1
course 1
see 1
but 1
that 1
to 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
this 1
would 1
carry 1
any 1
suggestion 1
of 1
harm 1
in 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
his 1
master 1
was 1
concerned 1
tarzan 1
could 1
not 1
guess 1
what 1
had 1
brought 1
the 1
beast 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
augured 1
well 1
for 1
what 1
he 1
might 1
accomplish 1
but 1
when 1
tarzan 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
sheeta 1
to 1
gnaw 1
his 1
bonds 1
asunder 1
the 1
great 1
animal 1
could 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
understand 1
what 1
was 1
expected 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
instead 1
but 1
licked 1
the 1
wrists 1
and 1
arms 1
of 1
the 1
prisoner 1
presently 1
there 1
came 1
an 1
interruption 1
some 1
one 1
was 1
approaching 1
the 1
hut 1
sheeta 1
gave 1
a 1
low 1
growl 1
and 1
slunk 1
into 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
a 1
far 1
corner 1
evidently 1
the 1
visitor 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
the 1
warning 1
sound 1
for 1
almost 1
immediately 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
hut 1
a 1
tall 1
naked 1
savage 1
warrior 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
tarzan 1
s 1
side 1
and 1
pricked 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
spear 1
from 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
came 1
a 1
weird 1
uncanny 1
sound 1
and 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
it 1
there 1
leaped 1
from 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
s 1
farthermost 1
corner 1
a 1
bolt 1
of 1
fur 1
clad 1
death 1
full 1
upon 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
the 1
painted 1
savage 1
the 1
great 1
beast 1
struck 1
burying 1
sharp 1
talons 1
in 1
the 1
black 1
flesh 1
and 1
sinking 1
great 1
yellow 1
fangs 1
in 1
the 1
ebon 1
throat 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
fearful 1
scream 1
of 1
anguish 1
and 1
terror 1
from 1
the 1
black 1
and 1
mingled 1
with 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
hideous 1
challenge 1
of 1
the 1
killing 1
panther 1
then 1
came 1
silence 1
silence 1
except 1
for 1
the 1
rending 1
of 1
bloody 1
flesh 1
and 1
the 1
crunching 1
of 1
human 1
bones 1
between 1
mighty 1
jaws 1
the 1
noise 1
had 1
brought 1
sudden 1
quiet 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
without 1
then 1
there 1
came 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
in 1
consultation 1
high 1
pitched 1
fear 1
filled 1
voices 1
and 1
deep 1
low 1
tones 1
of 1
authority 1
as 1
the 1
chief 1
spoke 1
tarzan 1
and 1
the 1
panther 1
heard 1
the 1
approaching 1
footsteps 1
of 1
many 1
men 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
tarzan 1
s 1
surprise 1
the 1
great 1
cat 1
rose 1
from 1
across 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
its 1
kill 1
and 1
slunk 1
noiselessly 1
from 1
the 1
hut 1
through 1
the 1
aperture 1
through 1
which 1
it 1
had 1
entered 1
the 1
man 1
heard 1
the 1
soft 1
scraping 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
as 1
it 1
passed 1
over 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
palisade 1
and 1
then 1
silence 1
from 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
savages 1
approaching 1
to 1
investigate 1
he 1
had 1
little 1
hope 1
that 1
sheeta 1
would 1
return 1
for 1
had 1
the 1
great 1
cat 1
intended 1
to 1
defend 1
him 1
against 1
all 1
comers 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
remained 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
as 1
it 1
heard 1
the 1
approaching 1
savages 1
without 1
tarzan 1
knew 1
how 1
strange 1
were 1
the 1
workings 1
of 1
the 1
brains 1
of 1
the 1
mighty 1
carnivora 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
how 1
fiendishly 1
fearless 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
certain 1
death 1
and 1
again 1
how 1
timid 1
upon 1
the 1
slightest 1
provocation 1
there 1
was 1
doubt 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
that 1
some 1
note 1
of 1
the 1
approaching 1
blacks 1
vibrating 1
with 1
fear 1
had 1
struck 1
an 1
answering 1
chord 1
in 1
the 1
nervous 1
system 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
sending 1
him 1
slinking 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
his 1
tail 1
between 1
his 1
legs 1
the 1
man 1
shrugged 1
well 1
what 1
of 1
it 1
he 1
had 1
expected 1
to 1
die 1
and 1
after 1
all 1
what 1
might 1
sheeta 1
have 1
done 1
for 1
him 1
other 1
than 1
to 1
maul 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
his 1
enemies 1
before 1
a 1
rifle 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
whites 1
should 1
have 1
dispatched 1
him 1
if 1
the 1
cat 1
could 1
have 1
released 1
him 1
ah 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
resulted 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
story 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
proved 1
beyond 1
the 1
understanding 1
of 1
sheeta 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
beast 1
was 1
gone 1
and 1
tarzan 1
must 1
definitely 1
abandon 1
hope 1
the 1
natives 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
to 1
the 1
hut 1
now 1
peering 1
fearfully 1
into 1
the 1
dark 1
interior 1
two 1
in 1
advance 1
held 1
lighted 1
torches 1
in 1
their 1
left 1
hands 1
and 1
ready 1
spears 1
in 1
their 1
right 1
they 1
held 1
back 1
timorously 1
against 1
those 1
behind 1
who 1
were 1
pushing 1
them 1
forward 1
the 1
shrieks 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
s 1
victim 1
mingled 1
with 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
cat 1
had 1
wrought 1
mightily 1
upon 1
their 1
poor 1
nerves 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
awful 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
dark 1
interior 1
seemed 1
even 1
more 1
terribly 1
ominous 1
than 1
had 1
the 1
frightful 1
screaming 1
presently 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
was 1
being 1
forced 1
unwillingly 1
within 1
hit 1
upon 1
a 1
happy 1
scheme 1
for 1
learning 1
first 1
the 1
precise 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
danger 1
which 1
menaced 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
silent 1
interior 1
with 1
a 1
quick 1
movement 1
he 1
flung 1
his 1
lighted 1
torch 1
into 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
instantly 1
all 1
within 1
was 1
illuminated 1
for 1
a 1
brief 1
second 1
before 1
the 1
burning 1
brand 1
was 1
dashed 1
out 1
against 1
the 1
earth 1
floor 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
prisoner 1
still 1
securely 1
bound 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
last 1
seen 1
him 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
another 1
figure 1
equally 1
as 1
motionless 1
its 1
throat 1
and 1
breasts 1
horribly 1
torn 1
and 1
mangled 1
the 1
sight 1
that 1
met 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
foremost 1
savages 1
inspired 1
more 1
terror 1
within 1
their 1
superstitious 1
breasts 1
than 1
would 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
sheeta 1
for 1
they 1
saw 1
only 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
a 1
ferocious 1
attack 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
their 1
fellows 1
not 1
seeing 1
the 1
cause 1
their 1
fear 1
ridden 1
minds 1
were 1
free 1
to 1
attribute 1
the 1
ghastly 1
work 1
to 1
supernatural 1
causes 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
they 1
turned 1
screaming 1
from 1
the 1
hut 1
bowling 1
over 1
those 1
who 1
stood 1
directly 1
behind 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
exuberance 1
of 1
their 1
terror 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
tarzan 1
heard 1
only 1
the 1
murmur 1
of 1
excited 1
voices 1
from 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
evidently 1
the 1
savages 1
were 1
once 1
more 1
attempting 1
to 1
work 1
up 1
their 1
flickering 1
courage 1
to 1
a 1
point 1
that 1
would 1
permit 1
them 1
to 1
make 1
another 1
invasion 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
for 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
came 1
a 1
savage 1
yell 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
warriors 1
give 1
to 1
bolster 1
up 1
their 1
bravery 1
upon 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
battle 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
it 1
was 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
whites 1
who 1
first 1
entered 1
carrying 1
torches 1
and 1
guns 1
tarzan 1
was 1
not 1
surprised 1
to 1
discover 1
that 1
neither 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
rokoff 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
wagered 1
his 1
soul 1
that 1
no 1
power 1
on 1
earth 1
could 1
have 1
tempted 1
that 1
great 1
coward 1
to 1
face 1
the 1
unknown 1
menace 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
when 1
the 1
natives 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
men 1
were 1
not 1
attacked 1
they 1
too 1
crowded 1
into 1
the 1
interior 1
their 1
voices 1
hushed 1
with 1
terror 1
as 1
they 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
mutilated 1
corpse 1
of 1
their 1
comrade 1
the 1
whites 1
tried 1
in 1
vain 1
to 1
elicit 1
an 1
explanation 1
from 1
tarzan 1
but 1
to 1
all 1
their 1
queries 1
he 1
but 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
a 1
grim 1
and 1
knowing 1
smile 1
curving 1
his 1
lips 1
at 1
last 1
rokoff 1
came 1
his 1
face 1
grew 1
very 1
white 1
as 1
his 1
eyes 1
rested 1
upon 1
the 1
bloody 1
thing 1
grinning 1
up 1
at 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
floor 1
the 1
face 1
set 1
in 1
a 1
death 1
mask 1
of 1
excruciating 1
horror 1
come 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
let 1
us 1
get 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
finish 1
this 1
demon 1
before 1
he 1
has 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
repeat 1
this 1
thing 1
upon 1
more 1
of 1
your 1
people 1
the 1
chief 1
gave 1
orders 1
that 1
tarzan 1
should 1
be 1
lifted 1
and 1
carried 1
to 1
the 1
stake 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
several 1
minutes 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
prevail 1
upon 1
any 1
of 1
his 1
men 1
to 1
touch 1
the 1
prisoner 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
four 1
of 1
the 1
younger 1
warriors 1
dragged 1
tarzan 1
roughly 1
from 1
the 1
hut 1
and 1
once 1
outside 1
the 1
pall 1
of 1
terror 1
seemed 1
lifted 1
from 1
the 1
savage 1
hearts 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
howling 1
blacks 1
pushed 1
and 1
buffeted 1
the 1
prisoner 1
down 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
and 1
bound 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
post 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
circle 1
of 1
little 1
fires 1
and 1
boiling 1
cooking 1
pots 1
when 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
made 1
fast 1
and 1
seemed 1
quite 1
helpless 1
and 1
beyond 1
the 1
faintest 1
hope 1
of 1
succour 1
rokoff 1
s 1
shrivelled 1
wart 1
of 1
courage 1
swelled 1
to 1
its 1
usual 1
proportions 1
when 1
danger 1
was 1
not 1
present 1
he 1
stepped 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
and 1
seizing 1
a 1
spear 1
from 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
savages 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
prod 1
the 1
helpless 1
victim 1
a 1
little 1
stream 1
of 1
blood 1
trickled 1
down 1
the 1
giant 1
s 1
smooth 1
skin 1
from 1
the 1
wound 1
in 1
his 1
side 1
but 1
no 1
murmur 1
of 1
pain 1
passed 1
his 1
lips 1
the 1
smile 1
of 1
contempt 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
seemed 1
to 1
infuriate 1
the 1
russian 1
with 1
a 1
volley 1
of 1
oaths 1
he 1
leaped 1
at 1
the 1
helpless 1
captive 1
beating 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
with 1
his 1
clenched 1
fists 1
and 1
kicking 1
him 1
mercilessly 1
about 1
the 1
legs 1
then 1
he 1
raised 1
the 1
heavy 1
spear 1
to 1
drive 1
it 1
through 1
the 1
mighty 1
heart 1
and 1
still 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
smiled 1
contemptuously 1
upon 1
him 1
before 1
rokoff 1
could 1
drive 1
the 1
weapon 1
home 1
the 1
chief 1
sprang 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
dragged 1
him 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
intended 1
victim 1
stop 1
white 1
man 1
he 1
cried 1
rob 1
us 1
of 1
this 1
prisoner 1
and 1
our 1
death 1
dance 1
and 1
you 1
yourself 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
place 1
the 1
threat 1
proved 1
most 1
effective 1
in 1
keeping 1
the 1
russian 1
from 1
further 1
assaults 1
upon 1
the 1
prisoner 1
though 1
he 1
continued 1
to 1
stand 1
a 1
little 1
apart 1
and 1
hurl 1
taunts 1
at 1
his 1
enemy 1
he 1
told 1
tarzan 1
that 1
he 1
himself 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1

enlarged 1
upon 1
the 1
horrors 1
of 1
the 1
future 1
life 1
of 1
tarzan 1
s 1
son 1

intimated 1
that 1

vengeance 1
would 1
reach 1

this 1

add 1
to 1
the 1
torments 1
that 1
you 1
must 1
suffer 1
before 1

about 1

at 1
the 1
stake 1
to 1
tarzan 1
s 1
memory 1
came 1
a 1
similar 1
scene 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
rescued 1
d 1
arnot 1
from 1
a 1
like 1
predicament 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
moment 1

have 1
ended 1

was 1
there 1
now 1
to 1
rescue 1
him 1
in 1
all 1
the 1

there 1
was 1
none 1
able 1
to 1
save 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
torture 1
and 1
the 1
death 1

thought 1
that 1
these 1
human 1
fiends 1
would 1
devour 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
dance 1
was 1
done 1

him 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
qualm 1
of 1
horror 1
or 1
disgust 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
add 1
to 1

it 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
an 1
ordinary 1
white 1
man 1
for 1
all 1
his 1
life 1
tarzan 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
devour 1
the 1
flesh 1
of 1
their 1
kills 1
had 1
he 1
not 1
himself 1
battled 1
for 1
the 1
grisly 1
forearm 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
ape 1
at 1
that 1
long 1
gone 1
dum 1
dum 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
slain 1
the 1
fierce 1

won 1
his 1
niche 1
in 1
the 1
respect 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
kerchak 1
the 1
dancers 1
were 1
leaping 1
more 1
closely 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
the 1
spears 1
were 1
commencing 1
to 1
find 1
his 1
body 1
in 1
the 1

torturing 1
pricks 1
that 1
prefaced 1
the 1

far 1
out 1
in 1
the 1

rose 1
a 1
shrill 1
scream 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1

paused 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
interval 1
there 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
the 1
fast 1
bound 1
white 1
man 1
an 1
answering 1
shriek 1
more 1
fearsome 1
and 1
more 1
terrible 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1

that 1
had 1
roused 1
it 1
for 1
several 1
minutes 1
the 1

hesitated 1
then 1
at 1
the 1
urging 1
of 1
rokoff 1
and 1
their 1
chief 1
they 1
leaped 1
in 1
to 1
finish 1
the 1
dance 1
and 1
the 1
victim 1
but 1
ere 1
ever 1

which 1

for 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
blacks 1
and 1
the 1
whites 1
stood 1
transfixed 1
with 1
terror 1
their 1

were 1
riveted 1

that 1

all 1
that 1

could 1
get 1
out 1

him 1
for 1
the 1
hideous 1
nauseating 1
meals 1
he 1
brought 1
her 1
three 1
days 1
from 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
tarzan 1
had 1
been 1
marooned 1
the 1
kincaid 1
came 1
to 1
anchor 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
river 1
and 1
presently 1
rokoff 1
came 1
to 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
cabin 1
we 1
have 1
arrived 1
my 1
dear 1
he 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
sickening 1
leer 1
i 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
offer 1
you 1
safety 1
liberty 1
and 1
ease 1
my 1
heart 1
has 1
been 1
softened 1
toward 1
you 1
in 1
your 1
suffering 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
make 1
amends 1
as 1
best 1
i 1
may 1
your 1
husband 1
was 1
a 1
brute 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
best 1
who 1
found 1
him 1
naked 1
in 1
his 1
native 1
jungle 1
roaming 1
wild 1
with 1
the 1
savage 1
beasts 1
that 1
were 1
his 1
fellows 1
now 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
gentleman 1
not 1
only 1
born 1
of 1
noble 1
blood 1
but 1
raised 1
gently 1
as 1
befits 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
quality 1
to 1
you 1
dear 1
jane 1
i 1
offer 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
a 1
cultured 1
man 1
and 1
association 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
culture 1
and 1
refinement 1
which 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
sorely 1
missed 1
in 1
your 1
relations 1
with 1
the 1
poor 1
ape 1
that 1
through 1
your 1
girlish 1
infatuation 1
you 1
married 1
so 1
thoughtlessly 1
i 1
love 1
you 1
jane 1
you 1
have 1
but 1
to 1
say 1
the 1
word 1
and 1
no 1
further 1
sorrows 1
shall 1
afflict 1
you 1
even 1
your 1
baby 1
shall 1
be 1
returned 1
to 1
you 1
unharmed 1
outside 1
the 1
door 1
sven 1
anderssen 1
paused 1
with 1
the 1
noonday 1
meal 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
carrying 1
to 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
upon 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
long 1
stringy 1
neck 1
his 1
little 1
head 1
was 1
cocked 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
his 1
close 1
set 1
eyes 1
were 1
half 1
closed 1
his 1
ears 1
so 1
expressive 1
was 1
his 1
whole 1
attitude 1
of 1
stealthy 1
eavesdropping 1
seemed 1
truly 1
to 1
be 1
cocked 1
forward 1
even 1
his 1
long 1
yellow 1
straggly 1
moustache 1
appeared 1
to 1
assume 1
a 1
sly 1
droop 1
as 1
rokoff 1
closed 1
his 1
appeal 1
awaiting 1
the 1
reply 1
he 1
invited 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
surprise 1
upon 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
face 1
turned 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
disgust 1
she 1
fairly 1
shuddered 1
in 1
the 1
fellow 1
s 1
face 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
surprised 1
m 1
rokoff 1
she 1
said 1
had 1
you 1
attempted 1
to 1
force 1
me 1
to 1
submit 1
to 1
your 1
evil 1
desires 1
but 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
fatuous 1
as 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
i 1
wife 1
of 1
john 1
clayton 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
you 1
willingly 1
even 1
to 1
save 1
my 1
life 1
i 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
imagined 1
i 1
have 1
known 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
scoundrel 1
m 1
rokoff 1
but 1
until 1
now 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
taken 1
you 1
for 1
a 1
fool 1
rokoff 1
s 1
eyes 1
narrowed 1
and 1
the 1
red 1
of 1
mortification 1
flushed 1
out 1
the 1
pallor 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
step 1
toward 1
the 1
girl 1
threateningly 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
who 1
is 1
the 1
fool 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
hissed 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
broken 1
you 1
to 1
my 1
will 1
and 1
your 1
plebeian 1
yankee 1
stubbornness 1
has 1
cost 1
you 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
hold 1
dear 1
even 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
your 1
baby 1
for 1
by 1
the 1
bones 1
of 1
st 1
peter 1
i 1
ll 1
forego 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
planned 1
for 1
the 1
brat 1
and 1
cut 1
its 1
heart 1
out 1
before 1
your 1
very 1
eyes 1
you 1
ll 1
learn 1
what 1
it 1
means 1
to 1
insult 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
jane 1
clayton 1
turned 1
wearily 1
away 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
use 1
she 1
said 1
of 1
expatiating 1
upon 1
the 1
depths 1
to 1
which 1
your 1
vengeful 1
nature 1
can 1
sink 1
you 1
cannot 1
move 1
me 1
either 1
by 1
threats 1
or 1
deeds 1
my 1
baby 1
cannot 1
judge 1
yet 1
for 1
himself 1
but 1
i 1
his 1
mother 1
can 1
foresee 1
that 1
should 1
it 1
have 1
been 1
given 1
him 1
to 1
survive 1
to 1
man 1
s 1
estate 1
he 1
would 1
willingly 1
sacrifice 1
his 1
life 1
for 1
the 1
honour 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
love 1
him 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
purchase 1
his 1
life 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
price 1
did 1
i 1
he 1
would 1
execrate 1
my 1
memory 1
to 1
the 1
day 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
rokoff 1
was 1
now 1
thoroughly 1
angered 1
because 1
of 1
his 1
failure 1
to 1
reduce 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
terror 1
he 1
felt 1
only 1
hate 1
for 1
her 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
his 1
diseased 1
mind 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
force 1
her 1
to 1
accede 1
to 1
his 1
demands 1
as 1
the 1
price 1
of 1
her 1
life 1
and 1
her 1
child 1
s 1
the 1
cup 1
of 1
his 1
revenge 1
would 1
be 1
filled 1
to 1
brimming 1
when 1
he 1
could 1
flaunt 1
the 1
wife 1
of 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
in 1
the 1
capitals 1
of 1
europe 1
as 1
his 1
mistress 1
again 1
he 1
stepped 1
closer 1
to 1
her 1
his 1
evil 1
face 1
was 1
convulsed 1
with 1
rage 1
and 1
desire 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
beast 1
he 1
sprang 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
with 1
his 1
strong 1
fingers 1
at 1
her 1
throat 1
forced 1
her 1
backward 1
upon 1
the 1
berth 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
cabin 1
opened 1
noisily 1
rokoff 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
turning 1
faced 1
the 1
swede 1
cook 1
into 1
the 1
fellow 1
s 1
usually 1
foxy 1
eyes 1
had 1
come 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
utter 1
stupidity 1
his 1
lower 1
jaw 1
drooped 1
in 1
vacuous 1
harmony 1
he 1
busied 1
himself 1
in 1
arranging 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
s 1
meal 1
upon 1
the 1
tiny 1
table 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
cabin 1
the 1
russian 1
glared 1
at 1
him 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
he 1
cried 1
by 1
entering 1
here 1
without 1
permission 1
get 1
out 1
the 1
cook 1
turned 1
his 1
watery 1
blue 1
eyes 1
upon 1
rokoff 1
and 1
smiled 1
vacuously 1
ay 1
tank 1
it 1
blow 1
purty 1
soon 1
purty 1
hard 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
began 1
rearranging 1
the 1
few 1
dishes 1
upon 1
the 1
little 1
table 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
or 1
i 1
ll 1
throw 1
you 1
out 1
you 1
miserable 1
blockhead 1
roared 1
rokoff 1
taking 1
a 1
threatening 1
step 1
toward 1
the 1
swede 1
anderssen 1
continued 1
to 1
smile 1
foolishly 1
in 1
his 1
direction 1
but 1
one 1
ham 1
like 1
paw 1
slid 1
stealthily 1
to 1
the 1
handle 1
of 1
the 1
long 1
slim 1
knife 1
that 1
protruded 1
from 1
the 1
greasy 1
cord 1
supporting 1
his 1
soiled 1
apron 1
rokoff 1
saw 1
the 1
move 1
and 1
stopped 1
short 1
in 1
his 1
advance 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
toward 1
jane 1
clayton 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
until 1
tomorrow 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
reconsider 1
your 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
offer 1
all 1
will 1
be 1
sent 1
ashore 1
upon 1
one 1
pretext 1
or 1
another 1
except 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
paulvitch 1
and 1
myself 1
then 1
without 1
interruption 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
witness 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
baby 1
he 1
spoke 1
in 1
french 1
that 1
the 1
cook 1
might 1
not 1
understand 1
the 1
sinister 1
portent 1
of 1
his 1
words 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
he 1
banged 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cabin 1
without 1
another 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
interrupted 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
sorry 1
work 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
sven 1
anderssen 1
turned 1
toward 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
the 1
idiotic 1
expression 1
that 1
had 1
masked 1
his 1
thoughts 1
had 1
fallen 1
away 1
and 1
in 1
its 1
place 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
craft 1
and 1
cunning 1
hay 1

at 1

surprise 1

understood 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
then 1
anderssen 1
grinned 1
you 1
bat 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
you 1
heard 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
here 1
and 1
came 1
to 1

it 1

purty 1
soon 1
purty 1
hard 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
cabin 1
though 1
jane 1
clayton 1
doubted 1
the 1
cook 1
s 1
ability 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
any 1
material 1
service 1
to 1
her 1
she 1
was 1
nevertheless 1
deeply 1
grateful 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
what 1
he 1
already 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
feeling 1
that 1
among 1
these 1
enemies 1
she 1
had 1
one 1
friend 1
brought 1
the 1
first 1
ray 1
of 1
comfort 1
that 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
lighten 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
her 1
miserable 1
apprehensions 1
throughout 1
the 1
long 1
voyage 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
she 1
saw 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
rokoff 1
that 1
day 1
nor 1
of 1
any 1
other 1
until 1
sven 1
came 1
with 1
her 1
evening 1
meal 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
draw 1
him 1
into 1
conversation 1
relative 1
to 1
his 1
plans 1
to 1
aid 1
her 1
but 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
get 1
from 1
him 1
was 1
his 1
stereotyped 1
prophecy 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
future 1
state 1
of 1
the 1
wind 1
he 1
seemed 1
suddenly 1
to 1
have 1
relapsed 1
into 1
his 1
wonted 1
state 1
of 1
dense 1
stupidity 1
however 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
leaving 1
her 1
cabin 1
a 1
little 1
later 1
with 1
the 1
empty 1
dishes 1
he 1
whispered 1
very 1
low 1
leave 1
on 1
your 1
clothes 1
an 1
roll 1
up 1
your 1
blankets 1
ay 1
come 1
back 1
after 1
you 1
purty 1
soon 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
slipped 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
at 1
once 1
but 1
jane 1
laid 1
her 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
sleeve 1
my 1
baby 1
she 1
asked 1
i 1

without 1

when 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
jane 1
clayton 1
sank 1
down 1
upon 1
her 1
berth 1
in 1
utter 1
bewilderment 1
what 1
was 1
she 1
to 1
do 1
suspicions 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
intentions 1
of 1
the 1
swede 1
swarmed 1
her 1
brain 1
might 1
she 1
not 1
be 1
infinitely 1
worse 1
off 1
if 1
she 1
gave 1
herself 1
into 1
his 1
power 1
than 1
she 1
already 1
was 1
no 1
she 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
worse 1
off 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
the 1
devil 1
himself 1
than 1
with 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
for 1
the 1
devil 1
at 1
least 1
bore 1
the 1
reputation 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
gentleman 1
she 1
swore 1
a 1
dozen 1
times 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
leave 1
the 1
kincaid 1
without 1
her 1
baby 1
and 1
yet 1
she 1
remained 1
clothed 1
long 1
past 1
her 1
usual 1
hour 1
for 1
retiring 1
and 1
her 1
blankets 1
were 1
neatly 1
rolled 1
and 1
bound 1
with 1
stout 1
cord 1
when 1
about 1
midnight 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
stealthy 1
scratching 1
upon 1
the 1
panels 1
of 1
her 1
door 1
swiftly 1
she 1
crossed 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
drew 1
the 1
bolt 1
softly 1
the 1
door 1
swung 1
open 1
to 1
admit 1
the 1
muffled 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
swede 1
on 1
one 1
arm 1
he 1
carried 1
a 1
bundle 1
evidently 1
his 1
blankets 1
his 1
other 1
hand 1
was 1
raised 1
in 1
a 1
gesture 1
commanding 1
silence 1
a 1
grimy 1
forefinger 1
upon 1
his 1
lips 1
he 1
came 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
carry 1
this 1
he 1
said 1
do 1
not 1
make 1
some 1
noise 1
when 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
it 1
ban 1
your 1
kid 1
quick 1
hands 1
snatched 1
the 1
bundle 1
from 1
the 1
cook 1
and 1
hungry 1
mother 1
arms 1
folded 1
the 1
sleeping 1
infant 1
to 1
her 1
breast 1
while 1
hot 1
tears 1
of 1
joy 1
ran 1
down 1
her 1
cheeks 1
and 1
her 1
whole 1
frame 1
shook 1
with 1
the 1
emotion 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
come 1
said 1
anderssen 1
we 1
got 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
vaste 1
he 1
snatched 1
up 1
her 1
bundle 1
of 1
blankets 1
and 1
outside 1
the 1
cabin 1
door 1
his 1
own 1
as 1
well 1
then 1
he 1
led 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
side 1
steadied 1
her 1
descent 1
of 1
the 1
monkey 1
ladder 1
holding 1
the 1
child 1
for 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
climbed 1
to 1
the 1
waiting 1
boat 1
below 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
he 1
had 1
cut 1
the 1
rope 1
that 1
held 1
the 1
small 1
boat 1
to 1
the 1
steamer 1
s 1
side 1
and 1
bending 1
silently 1
to 1
the 1
muffled 1
oars 1
was 1
pulling 1
toward 1
the 1
black 1
shadows 1
up 1
the 1
ugambi 1
river 1
anderssen 1
rowed 1
on 1
as 1
though 1
quite 1
sure 1
of 1
his 1
ground 1
and 1
when 1
after 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
moon 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
clouds 1
there 1
was 1
revealed 1
upon 1
their 1
left 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
tributary 1
running 1
into 1
the 1
ugambi 1
up 1
this 1
narrow 1
channel 1
the 1
swede 1
turned 1
the 1
prow 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
boat 1
jane 1
clayton 1
wondered 1
if 1
the 1
man 1
knew 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
bound 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
in 1
his 1
capacity 1
as 1
cook 1
he 1
had 1
that 1
day 1
been 1
rowed 1
up 1
this 1
very 1
stream 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
village 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
bartered 1
with 1
the 1
natives 1
for 1
such 1
provisions 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
for 1
sale 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
there 1
arranged 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
his 1
plan 1
for 1
the 1
adventure 1
upon 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
now 1
setting 1
forth 1
even 1
though 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
full 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
river 1
was 1
quite 1
dark 1
the 1
giant 1
trees 1
overhung 1
its 1
narrow 1
banks 1
meeting 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
arch 1
above 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
spanish 1
moss 1
dropped 1
from 1
the 1
gracefully 1
bending 1
limbs 1
and 1
enormous 1
creepers 1
clambered 1
in 1
riotous 1
profusion 1
from 1
the 1
ground 1
to 1
the 1
loftiest 1
branch 1
falling 1
in 1
curving 1
loops 1
almost 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
s 1
placid 1
breast 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
surface 1
would 1
be 1
suddenly 1
broken 1
ahead 1
of 1
them 1
by 1
a 1
huge 1
crocodile 1
startled 1
by 1
the 1
splashing 1
of 1
the 1
oars 1
or 1
snorting 1
and 1
blowing 1
a 1
family 1
of 1
hippos 1
would 1
dive 1
from 1
a 1
sandy 1
bar 1
to 1
the 1
cool 1
safe 1
depths 1
of 1
the 1
bottom 1
from 1
the 1
dense 1
jungles 1
upon 1
either 1
side 1
came 1
the 1
weird 1
night 1
cries 1
of 1
the 1
carnivora 1
the 1
maniacal 1
voice 1
of 1
the 1
hyena 1
the 1
coughing 1
grunt 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
awful 1
roar 1
of 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
with 1
them 1
strange 1
uncanny 1
notes 1
that 1
the 1
girl 1
could 1
not 1
ascribe 1
to 1
any 1
particular 1
night 1
prowler 1
more 1
terrible 1
because 1
of 1
their 1
mystery 1
huddled 1
in 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
she 1
sat 1
with 1
her 1
baby 1
strained 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
bosom 1
and 1
because 1
of 1
that 1
little 1
tender 1
helpless 1
thing 1
she 1
was 1
happier 1
tonight 1
than 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
for 1
many 1
a 1
sorrow 1
ridden 1
day 1
even 1
though 1
she 1
knew 1
not 1
to 1
what 1
fate 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
or 1
how 1
soon 1
that 1
fate 1
might 1
overtake 1
her 1
still 1
was 1
she 1
happy 1
and 1
thankful 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
however 1
brief 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
press 1
her 1
baby 1
tightly 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
she 1
could 1
scarce 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
look 1
again 1
upon 1
the 1
bright 1
face 1
of 1
her 1
little 1
black 1
eyed 1
jack 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
strain 1
her 1
eyes 1
through 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
night 1
to 1
have 1
but 1
a 1
tiny 1
peep 1
at 1
those 1
beloved 1
features 1
but 1
only 1
the 1
dim 1
outline 1
of 1
the 1
baby 1
face 1
rewarded 1
her 1
efforts 1
then 1
once 1
more 1
she 1
would 1
cuddle 1
the 1
warm 1
little 1
bundle 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
throbbing 1
heart 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
close 1
to 1
three 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
that 1
anderssen 1
brought 1
the 1
boat 1
s 1
nose 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
before 1
a 1
clearing 1
where 1
could 1
be 1
dimly 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
waning 1
moonlight 1
a 1
cluster 1
of 1
native 1
huts 1
encircled 1
by 1
a 1
thorn 1
boma 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
gate 1
they 1
were 1
admitted 1
by 1
a 1
native 1
woman 1
the 1
wife 1
of 1
the 1
chief 1
whom 1
anderssen 1
had 1
paid 1
to 1
assist 1
him 1
she 1
took 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
s 1
hut 1
but 1
anderssen 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
sleep 1
without 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
so 1
her 1
duty 1
having 1
been 1
completed 1
she 1
left 1
them 1
to 1
their 1
own 1
devices 1
the 1
swede 1
after 1
explaining 1
in 1
his 1
gruff 1
way 1
that 1
the 1
huts 1
were 1
doubtless 1
filthy 1
and 1
vermin 1
ridden 1
spread 1
jane 1
s 1
blankets 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
at 1
a 1
little 1
distance 1
unrolled 1
his 1
own 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
to 1
sleep 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
the 1
girl 1
could 1
find 1
a 1
comfortable 1
position 1
upon 1
the 1
hard 1
ground 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
baby 1
in 1
the 1
hollow 1
of 1
her 1
arm 1
she 1
dropped 1
asleep 1
from 1
utter 1
exhaustion 1
when 1
she 1
awoke 1
it 1
was 1
broad 1
daylight 1
about 1
her 1
were 1
clustered 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
curious 1
natives 1
mostly 1
men 1
for 1
among 1
the 1
aborigines 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
male 1
who 1
owns 1
this 1
characteristic 1
in 1
its 1
most 1
exaggerated 1
form 1
instinctively 1
jane 1
clayton 1
drew 1
the 1
baby 1
more 1
closely 1
to 1
her 1
though 1
she 1
soon 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
blacks 1
were 1
far 1
from 1
intending 1
her 1
or 1
the 1
child 1
any 1
harm 1
in 1
fact 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
offered 1
her 1
a 1
gourd 1
of 1
milk 1
a 1
filthy 1
smoke 1
begrimed 1
gourd 1
with 1
the 1
ancient 1
rind 1
of 1
long 1
curdled 1
milk 1
caked 1
in 1
layers 1
within 1
its 1
neck 1
but 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
giver 1
touched 1
her 1
deeply 1
and 1
her 1
face 1
lightened 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
almost 1
forgotten 1
smiles 1
of 1
radiance 1
that 1
had 1
helped 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
beauty 1
famous 1
both 1
in 1
baltimore 1
and 1
london 1
she 1
took 1
the 1
gourd 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
rather 1
than 1
cause 1
the 1
giver 1
pain 1
raised 1
it 1
to 1
her 1
lips 1
though 1
for 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
her 1
she 1
could 1
scarce 1
restrain 1
the 1
qualm 1
of 1
nausea 1
that 1
surged 1
through 1
her 1
as 1
the 1
malodorous 1
thing 1
approached 1
her 1
nostrils 1
it 1
was 1
anderssen 1
who 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
rescue 1
and 1
taking 1
the 1
gourd 1
from 1
her 1
drank 1
a 1
portion 1
himself 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
native 1
with 1
a 1
gift 1
of 1
blue 1
beads 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
shining 1
brightly 1
now 1
and 1
though 1
the 1
baby 1
still 1
slept 1
jane 1
could 1
scarce 1
restrain 1
her 1
impatient 1
desire 1
to 1
have 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
brief 1
glance 1
at 1
the 1
beloved 1
face 1
the 1
natives 1
had 1
withdrawn 1
at 1
a 1
command 1
from 1
their 1
chief 1
who 1
now 1
stood 1
talking 1
with 1
anderssen 1
a 1
little 1
apart 1
from 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
debated 1
the 1
wisdom 1
of 1
risking 1
disturbing 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
slumber 1
by 1
lifting 1
the 1
blanket 1
that 1
now 1
protected 1
its 1
face 1
from 1
the 1
sun 1
she 1
noted 1
that 1
the 1
cook 1
conversed 1
with 1
the 1
chief 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
negro 1
what 1
a 1
remarkable 1
man 1
the 1
fellow 1
was 1
indeed 1
she 1
had 1
thought 1
him 1
ignorant 1
and 1
stupid 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
day 1
before 1
and 1
now 1
within 1
the 1
past 1
twenty 1
four 1
hours 1
she 1
had 1
learned 1
that 1
he 1
spoke 1
not 1
only 1
english 1
but 1
french 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
the 1
primitive 1
dialect 1
of 1
the 1
west 1
coast 1
she 1
had 1
thought 1
him 1
shifty 1
cruel 1
and 1
untrustworthy 1
yet 1
in 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
he 1
had 1
proved 1
himself 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
the 1
contrary 1
since 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
it 1
scarce 1
seemed 1
credible 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
serving 1
her 1
from 1
motives 1
purely 1
chivalrous 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
something 1
deeper 1
in 1
his 1
intentions 1
and 1
plans 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
yet 1
disclosed 1
she 1
wondered 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
looked 1
at 1
him 1
at 1
his 1
close 1
set 1
shifty 1
eyes 1
and 1
repulsive 1
features 1
she 1
shuddered 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
no 1
lofty 1
characteristics 1
could 1
be 1
hid 1
behind 1
so 1
foul 1
an 1
exterior 1
as 1
she 1

debated 1

uncovering 1

came 1
a 1
little 1
grunt 1
from 1
the 1
wee 1
bundle 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
gurgling 1
coo 1
that 1
set 1
her 1
heart 1
in 1
raptures 1
the 1
baby 1
was 1
awake 1
now 1
she 1

her 1

upon 1

quickly 1
she 1
snatched 1
the 1

from 1
before 1
the 1
infant 1

face 1
anderssen 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
stagger 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
holding 1
the 1
baby 1
at 1
arm 1

from 1
her 1
her 1
eyes 1
glued 1
in 1
horror 1
upon 1
the 1
little 1
chubby 1
face 1
and 1
twinkling 1
eyes 1
then 1
he 1
heard 1
her 1
piteous 1
cry 1
as 1
her 1
knees 1
gave 1
beneath 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
in 1
a 1
swoon 1

the 1
swede 1
as 1
the 1
warriors 1
clustered 1
thick 1
about 1
tarzan 1

sheeta 1
realized 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1

that 1
had 1
interrupted 1

to 1
have 1
his 1

launch 1
their 1

the 1

was 1
upon 1
the 1
instant 1
of 1
issuing 1
the 1
command 1
when 1
his 1

strayed 1
beyond 1

of 1

with 1
a 1

the 1

turned 1

after 1

of 1

turned 1
to 1

until 1
the 1

was 1
empty 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
the 1
blacks 1
had 1
disappeared 1
into 1
the 1

that 1

was 1
able 1
to 1
recall 1
his 1
savage 1
pack 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
discovered 1
to 1
his 1
chagrin 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
comparatively 1
intelligent 1
akut 1
understand 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
freed 1
from 1
the 1
bonds 1
that 1
held 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
stake 1
in 1
time 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
idea 1
would 1
filter 1
through 1
their 1
thick 1
skulls 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
meanwhile 1
many 1
things 1
might 1
happen 1
the 1
blacks 1
might 1
return 1
in 1
force 1
to 1
regain 1
their 1
village 1
the 1
whites 1
might 1
readily 1
pick 1
them 1
all 1
off 1
with 1
their 1
rifles 1
from 1
the 1
surrounding 1
trees 1
he 1
might 1
even 1
starve 1
to 1
death 1
before 1
the 1
dull 1
witted 1
apes 1
realized 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
them 1
to 1
gnaw 1
through 1
his 1
bonds 1
as 1
for 1
sheeta 1
the 1
great 1
cat 1
understood 1
even 1
less 1
than 1
the 1
apes 1
but 1
yet 1
tarzan 1
could 1
not 1
but 1
marvel 1
at 1
the 1
remarkable 1
characteristics 1
this 1
beast 1
had 1
evidenced 1
that 1
it 1
felt 1
real 1
affection 1
for 1
him 1
there 1
seemed 1
little 1
doubt 1
for 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
blacks 1
were 1
disposed 1
of 1
it 1
walked 1
slowly 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
about 1
the 1
stake 1
rubbing 1
its 1
sides 1
against 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
legs 1
and 1
purring 1
like 1
a 1
contented 1
tabby 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
volition 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
to 1
his 1
rescue 1
tarzan 1
could 1
not 1
doubt 1
his 1
sheeta 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
jewel 1
among 1
beasts 1
mugambi 1
s 1
absence 1
worried 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
not 1
a 1
little 1
he 1
attempted 1
to 1
learn 1
from 1
akut 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
fearing 1
that 1
the 1
beasts 1
freed 1
from 1
the 1
restraint 1
of 1
tarzan 1
s 1
presence 1
might 1
have 1
fallen 1
upon 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
devoured 1
him 1
but 1
to 1
all 1
his 1
questions 1
the 1
great 1
ape 1
but 1
pointed 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
from 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
the 1
night 1
passed 1
with 1
tarzan 1
still 1
fast 1
bound 1
to 1
the 1
stake 1
and 1
shortly 1
after 1
dawn 1
his 1
fears 1
were 1
realized 1
in 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
naked 1
black 1
figures 1
moving 1
stealthily 1
just 1
within 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
about 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
blacks 1
were 1
returning 1
with 1
daylight 1
their 1
courage 1
would 1
be 1
equal 1
to 1
the 1
demands 1
of 1
a 1
charge 1
upon 1
the 1
handful 1
of 1
beasts 1
that 1
had 1
routed 1
them 1
from 1
their 1
rightful 1
abodes 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
encounter 1
seemed 1
foregone 1
if 1
the 1
savages 1
could 1
curb 1
their 1
superstitious 1
terror 1
for 1
against 1
their 1
overwhelming 1
numbers 1
their 1
long 1
spears 1
and 1
poisoned 1
arrows 1
the 1
panther 1
and 1
the 1
apes 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
survive 1
a 1
really 1
determined 1
attack 1
that 1
the 1
blacks 1
were 1
preparing 1
for 1
a 1
charge 1
became 1
apparent 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
when 1
they 1
commenced 1
to 1
show 1
themselves 1
in 1
force 1
upon 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
clearing 1
dancing 1
and 1
jumping 1
about 1
as 1
they 1
waved 1
their 1
spears 1
and 1
shouted 1
taunts 1
and 1
fierce 1
warcries 1
toward 1
the 1
village 1
these 1
manoeuvres 1
tarzan 1
knew 1
would 1
continue 1
until 1
the 1
blacks 1
had 1
worked 1
themselves 1
into 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
hysterical 1
courage 1
sufficient 1
to 1
sustain 1
them 1
for 1
a 1
short 1
charge 1
toward 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
even 1
though 1
he 1
doubted 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
reach 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
attempt 1
he 1
believed 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
second 1
or 1
the 1
third 1
they 1
would 1
swarm 1
through 1
the 1
gateway 1
when 1
the 1
outcome 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
aught 1
than 1
the 1
extermination 1
of 1
tarzan 1
s 1
bold 1
but 1
unarmed 1
and 1
undisciplined 1
defenders 1
even 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
guessed 1
the 1
first 1
charge 1
carried 1
the 1
howling 1
warriors 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
a 1
shrill 1
weird 1
challenge 1
from 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
being 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
necessary 1
to 1
send 1
them 1
scurrying 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
bush 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
they 1
pranced 1
and 1
yelled 1
their 1
courage 1
to 1
the 1
sticking 1
point 1
and 1
again 1
essayed 1
a 1
charge 1
this 1
time 1
they 1
came 1
quite 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
gate 1
but 1
when 1
sheeta 1
and 1
the 1
hideous 1
apes 1
leaped 1
among 1
them 1
they 1
turned 1
screaming 1
in 1
terror 1
and 1
again 1
fled 1
to 1
the 1
jungle 1
again 1
was 1
the 1
dancing 1
and 1
shouting 1
repeated 1
this 1
time 1
tarzan 1
felt 1
no 1
doubt 1
they 1
would 1
enter 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
complete 1
the 1
work 1
that 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
determined 1
white 1
men 1
would 1
have 1
carried 1
to 1
a 1
successful 1
conclusion 1
at 1
the 1
first 1
attempt 1
to 1
have 1
rescue 1
come 1
so 1
close 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
thwarted 1
because 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
his 1
poor 1
savage 1
friends 1
understand 1
precisely 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
most 1
irritating 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
to 1
place 1
blame 1
upon 1
them 1
they 1
had 1
done 1
their 1
best 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
they 1
would 1
doubtless 1
remain 1
to 1
die 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
fruitless 1
effort 1
to 1
defend 1
him 1
the 1
blacks 1
were 1
already 1
preparing 1
for 1
the 1
charge 1
a 1
few 1
individuals 1
had 1
advanced 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
toward 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
were 1
exhorting 1
the 1
others 1
to 1
follow 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
whole 1
savage 1
horde 1
would 1
be 1
racing 1
across 1
the 1
clearing 1
tarzan 1
thought 1
only 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
child 1
somewhere 1
in 1
this 1
cruel 1
relentless 1
wilderness 1
his 1
heart 1
ached 1
for 1
the 1
son 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
no 1
longer 1
seek 1
to 1
save 1
that 1
and 1
the 1
realization 1
of 1
jane 1
s 1
suffering 1
were 1
all 1
that 1
weighed 1
upon 1
his 1
brave 1
spirit 1
in 1
these 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
his 1
last 1
moments 1
of 1
life 1
succour 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hope 1
for 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
instant 1
of 1
his 1
extremity 1
and 1
failed 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
further 1
for 1
which 1
to 1
hope 1
the 1
blacks 1
were 1
half 1
way 1
across 1
the 1
clearing 1
when 1
tarzan 1
s 1
attention 1
was 1
attracted 1
by 1
the 1
actions 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
the 1
beast 1
was 1
glaring 1
toward 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
huts 1
tarzan 1
followed 1
his 1
gaze 1
to 1
his 1
infinite 1
relief 1
and 1
delight 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
stalwart 1
form 1
of 1
mugambi 1
racing 1
toward 1
him 1
the 1
huge 1
black 1
was 1
panting 1
heavily 1
as 1
though 1
from 1
strenuous 1
physical 1
exertion 1
and 1
nervous 1
excitement 1
he 1
rushed 1
to 1
tarzan 1
s 1
side 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
the 1
savages 1
reached 1
the 1
village 1
gate 1
the 1
native 1
s 1
knife 1
severed 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
the 1
cords 1
that 1
bound 1
tarzan 1
to 1
the 1
stake 1
in 1
the 1
street 1
lay 1
the 1
corpses 1
of 1
the 1
savages 1
that 1
had 1
fallen 1
before 1
the 1
pack 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
tarzan 1
seized 1
a 1
spear 1
and 1
knob 1
stick 1
and 1
with 1
mugambi 1
at 1
his 1
side 1
and 1
the 1
snarling 1
pack 1
about 1
him 1
he 1
met 1
the 1
natives 1
as 1
they 1
poured 1
through 1
the 1
gate 1
fierce 1
and 1
terrible 1
was 1
the 1
battle 1
that 1
ensued 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
savages 1
were 1
routed 1
more 1
by 1
terror 1
perhaps 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
black 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
white 1
fighting 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
a 1
panther 1
and 1
the 1
huge 1
fierce 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
than 1
because 1
of 1
their 1
inability 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
relatively 1
small 1
force 1
that 1
opposed 1
them 1
one 1
prisoner 1
fell 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
tarzan 1
and 1
him 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
questioned 1
in 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
learn 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
rokoff 1
and 1
his 1
party 1
promised 1
his 1
liberty 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
the 1
information 1
the 1
black 1
told 1
all 1
he 1
knew 1
concerning 1
the 1
movements 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
early 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
their 1
chief 1
had 1
attempted 1
to 1
prevail 1
upon 1
the 1
whites 1
to 1
return 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
with 1
their 1
guns 1
destroy 1
the 1
ferocious 1
pack 1
that 1
had 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
rokoff 1
appeared 1
to 1
entertain 1
even 1
more 1
fears 1
of 1
the 1
giant 1
white 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
strange 1
companions 1
than 1
even 1
the 1
blacks 1
themselves 1
upon 1
no 1
conditions 1
would 1
he 1
consent 1
to 1
returning 1
even 1
within 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
instead 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
party 1
hurriedly 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
where 1
they 1
stole 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
canoes 1
the 1
blacks 1
had 1
hidden 1
there 1
the 1
last 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
seen 1
of 1
them 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
paddling 1
strongly 1
up 1
stream 1
their 1
porters 1
from 1
kaviri 1
s 1
village 1
wielding 1
the 1
blades 1
so 1
once 1
more 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
with 1
his 1
hideous 1
pack 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
search 1
for 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
son 1
and 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
his 1
abductor 1
for 1
weary 1
days 1
they 1
followed 1
through 1
an 1
almost 1
uninhabited 1
country 1
only 1
to 1
learn 1
at 1
last 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
upon 1
the 1
wrong 1
trail 1
the 1
little 1
band 1
had 1
been 1
reduced 1
by 1
three 1
for 1
three 1
of 1
akut 1
s 1
apes 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
the 1
fighting 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
now 1
with 1
akut 1
there 1
were 1
five 1
great 1
apes 1
and 1
sheeta 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
mugambi 1
and 1
tarzan 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
no 1
longer 1
heard 1
rumors 1
even 1
of 1
the 1
three 1
who 1
had 1
preceded 1
rokoff 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
and 1
woman 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
woman 1
were 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
guess 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
his 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
keep 1
him 1
hot 1
upon 1
the 1
trail 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
rokoff 1
would 1
be 1
following 1
this 1
trio 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
felt 1
confident 1
that 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
keep 1
upon 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
trail 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
winning 1
so 1
much 1
nearer 1
to 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
might 1
snatch 1
his 1
son 1
from 1
the 1
dangers 1
and 1
horrors 1
that 1
menaced 1
him 1
in 1
retracing 1
their 1
way 1
after 1
losing 1
rokoff 1
s 1
trail 1
tarzan 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
again 1
at 1
a 1
point 1
where 1
the 1
russian 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
taken 1
to 1
the 1
brush 1
in 1
a 1
northerly 1
direction 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
account 1
for 1
this 1
change 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
that 1
the 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
carried 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
river 1
by 1
the 1
two 1
who 1
now 1
had 1
possession 1
of 1
it 1
nowhere 1
along 1
the 1
way 1
however 1
could 1
he 1
gain 1
definite 1
information 1
that 1
might 1
assure 1
him 1
positively 1
that 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
native 1
they 1
questioned 1
had 1
seen 1
or 1
heard 1
of 1
this 1
other 1
party 1
though 1
nearly 1
all 1
had 1
had 1
direct 1
experience 1
with 1
the 1
russian 1
or 1
had 1
talked 1
with 1
others 1
who 1
had 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
difficulty 1
that 1
tarzan 1
could 1
find 1
means 1
to 1
communicate 1
with 1
the 1
natives 1
as 1
the 1
moment 1
their 1
eyes 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
companions 1
they 1
fled 1
precipitately 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
his 1
only 1
alternative 1
was 1
to 1
go 1
ahead 1
of 1
his 1
pack 1
and 1
waylay 1
an 1
occasional 1
warrior 1
whom 1
he 1
found 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
one 1
day 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
thus 1
engaged 1
tracking 1
an 1
unsuspecting 1
savage 1
he 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
fellow 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
hurling 1
a 1
spear 1
at 1
a 1
wounded 1
white 1
man 1
who 1
crouched 1
in 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
bush 1
at 1
the 1
trail 1
s 1
side 1
the 1
white 1
was 1
one 1
whom 1
tarzan 1
had 1
often 1
seen 1
and 1
whom 1
he 1
recognized 1
at 1
once 1
deep 1
in 1
his 1
memory 1
was 1
implanted 1
those 1
repulsive 1
features 1
the 1
close 1
set 1
eyes 1
the 1
shifty 1
expression 1
the 1
drooping 1
yellow 1
moustache 1
instantly 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
that 1
this 1
fellow 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
among 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
accompanied 1
rokoff 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
where 1
tarzan 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
prisoner 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
them 1
all 1
and 1
this 1
fellow 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
there 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
but 1
one 1
explanation 1
he 1
it 1
was 1
who 1
had 1
fled 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
with 1
the 1
woman 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
been 1
jane 1
clayton 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
now 1
of 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
rokoff 1
s 1
words 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
face 1
went 1
white 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
pasty 1
vice 1
marked 1
countenance 1
of 1
the 1
swede 1
across 1
tarzan 1
s 1
forehead 1
stood 1
out 1
the 1
broad 1
band 1
of 1
scarlet 1
that 1
marked 1
the 1
scar 1
where 1
years 1
before 1
terkoz 1
had 1
torn 1
a 1
great 1
strip 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
scalp 1
from 1
his 1
skull 1
in 1
the 1
fierce 1
battle 1
in 1
which 1
tarzan 1
had 1
sustained 1
his 1
fitness 1
to 1
the 1
kingship 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
kerchak 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
his 1
prey 1
the 1
black 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
him 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
he 1
leaped 1
upon 1
the 1
warrior 1
striking 1
down 1
the 1
spear 1
before 1
it 1
could 1
reach 1
its 1
mark 1
the 1
black 1
whipping 1
out 1
his 1
knife 1
turned 1
to 1
do 1
battle 1
with 1
this 1
new 1
enemy 1
while 1
the 1
swede 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
bush 1
witnessed 1
a 1
duel 1
the 1
like 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
dreamed 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
half 1
naked 1
white 1
man 1
battling 1
with 1
a 1
half 1
naked 1
black 1
hand 1
to 1
hand 1
with 1
the 1
crude 1
weapons 1
of 1
primeval 1
man 1
at 1
first 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
hands 1
and 1
teeth 1
like 1
the 1
primordial 1
brutes 1
from 1
whose 1
loins 1
their 1
forebears 1
sprung 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
anderssen 1
did 1
not 1
recognize 1
the 1
white 1
and 1
when 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
dawned 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
this 1
giant 1
before 1
his 1
eyes 1
went 1
wide 1
in 1
surprise 1
that 1
this 1
growling 1
rending 1
beast 1
could 1
ever 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
well 1
groomed 1
english 1
gentleman 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
prisoner 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
an 1
english 1
nobleman 1
he 1
had 1
learned 1
the 1
identity 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
prisoners 1
from 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
during 1
their 1
flight 1
up 1
the 1
ugambi 1
before 1
in 1
common 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
crew 1
of 1
the 1
steamer 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
who 1
the 1
two 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
fight 1
was 1
over 1
tarzan 1
had 1
been 1
compelled 1
to 1
kill 1
his 1
antagonist 1
as 1
the 1
fellow 1
would 1
not 1
surrender 1
the 1
swede 1
saw 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
leap 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
beside 1
the 1
corpse 1
of 1
his 1
foe 1
and 1
placing 1
one 1
foot 1
upon 1
the 1
broken 1
neck 1
lift 1
his 1
voice 1
in 1
the 1
hideous 1
challenge 1
of 1
the 1
victorious 1
bull 1
ape 1
anderssen 1
shuddered 1
then 1
tarzan 1
turned 1
toward 1
him 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
cold 1
and 1
cruel 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
grey 1
eyes 1
the 1
swede 1
read 1
murder 1
where 1
is 1
my 1
wife 1
growled 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
where 1
is 1
the 1
child 1
anderssen 1
tried 1
to 1
reply 1
but 1
a 1
sudden 1
fit 1
of 1
coughing 1
choked 1
him 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
arrow 1
entirely 1
through 1
his 1
chest 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
coughed 1
the 1
blood 1
from 1
his 1
wounded 1
lung 1
poured 1
suddenly 1
from 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
nostrils 1
tarzan 1
stood 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
paroxysm 1
to 1
pass 1
like 1
a 1
bronze 1
image 1
cold 1
hard 1
and 1
relentless 1
he 1
stood 1
over 1
the 1
helpless 1
man 1
waiting 1
to 1
wring 1
such 1
information 1
from 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
needed 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
kill 1
presently 1
the 1
coughing 1
and 1
haemorrhage 1
ceased 1
and 1
again 1
the 1
wounded 1
man 1
tried 1
to 1
speak 1
tarzan 1
knelt 1
near 1
the 1
faintly 1
moving 1
lips 1
the 1
wife 1
and 1
child 1
he 1
repeated 1
where 1
are 1
they 1
anderssen 1
pointed 1
up 1
the 1
trail 1
the 1
russian 1
he 1
got 1
them 1
he 1
whispered 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
here 1
continued 1
tarzan 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
not 1
with 1
rokoff 1
they 1
catch 1
us 1
replied 1
anderssen 1
in 1
a 1
voice 1
so 1
low 1
that 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
could 1
just 1
distinguish 1
the 1
words 1
they 1
catch 1
us 1
ay 1
fight 1
but 1
my 1
men 1
they 1
all 1

away 1

with 1
them 1
where 1
were 1
you 1
taking 1
them 1
asked 1
tarzan 1
and 1
then 1
fiercely 1
leaping 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
fellow 1
with 1
fierce 1
eyes 1
blazing 1
with 1
the 1
passion 1
of 1
hate 1
and 1
vengeance 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
with 1
difficulty 1
controlled 1
what 1
harm 1
did 1

that 1

a 1
look 1
of 1
wide 1
eyed 1
surprise 1
overspread 1
anderssen 1
s 1
face 1
why 1
he 1
whispered 1
ay 1

he 1
continued 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
pointing 1
to 1
the 1
arrow 1
protruding 1
from 1
his 1
breast 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
tone 1
and 1
expression 1
that 1
convinced 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
his 1
assertions 1
more 1
weighty 1
than 1
anything 1
else 1
was 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
anderssen 1
evidently 1
seemed 1
more 1
hurt 1
than 1
frightened 1
he 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
so 1
tarzan 1
s 1
threats 1
had 1
little 1
effect 1
upon 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
apparent 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
the 1
englishman 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
truth 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
wrong 1
him 1
by 1
harbouring 1
the 1
belief 1
that 1
his 1
words 1
and 1
manner 1
indicated 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
entertained 1
the 1
ape 1

instantly 1
dropped 1
to 1
his 1
knees 1
beside 1
the 1
swede 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
he 1
said 1
very 1
simply 1
i 1
had 1
looked 1
for 1
none 1
but 1
knaves 1
in 1

with 1

now 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
drop 1
it 1

the 1
more 1
important 1

of 1
getting 1
you 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
comfort 1
and 1
looking 1
after 1

on 1
your 1

go 1
on 1

for 1

said 1
ay 1

gude 1
as 1
dead 1
already 1
but 1
he 1
hesitated 1

up 1

tarzan 1
shuddered 1
a 1
moment 1
ago 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
upon 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
killing 1
this 1
man 1
now 1
he 1
could 1
no 1
more 1
have 1
taken 1
his 1

than 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
taken 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
his 1
best 1

he 1
lifted 1
the 1

s 1
head 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
to 1
change 1
and 1
ease 1
his 1
position 1
again 1
came 1
a 1
fit 1
of 1
coughing 1
and 1
the 1
terrible 1
haemorrhage 1
after 1
it 1
was 1
over 1
anderssen 1
lay 1
with 1
closed 1
eyes 1
tarzan 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
until 1
he 1
suddenly 1
raised 1
his 1
eyes 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
sighed 1
and 1
spoke 1

a 1
very 1
low 1
weak 1

scooped 1
a 1
shallow 1
grave 1
for 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
cook 1
beneath 1
whose 1
repulsive 1
exterior 1
had 1
beaten 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
a 1
chivalrous 1
gentleman 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
cruel 1
jungle 1
for 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
given 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
the 1
service 1
of 1
his 1
little 1
son 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
then 1
tarzan 1
took 1
up 1
again 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
rokoff 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
positive 1
that 1
the 1
woman 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
was 1
indeed 1
jane 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
again 1
fallen 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
incredible 1
speed 1
of 1
his 1
fleet 1
and 1
agile 1
muscles 1
he 1
moved 1
at 1
but 1
a 1
snail 1
s 1
pace 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
difficulty 1
that 1
he 1
kept 1
the 1
trail 1
for 1
there 1
were 1
many 1
paths 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
crossing 1
and 1
crisscrossing 1
forking 1
and 1
branching 1
in 1
all 1
directions 1
and 1
over 1
them 1
all 1
had 1
passed 1
natives 1
innumerable 1
coming 1
and 1
going 1
the 1
spoor 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
men 1
was 1
obliterated 1
by 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
native 1
carriers 1
who 1
had 1
followed 1
them 1
and 1
over 1
all 1
was 1
the 1
spoor 1
of 1
other 1
natives 1
and 1
of 1
wild 1
beasts 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
perplexing 1
yet 1
tarzan 1
kept 1
on 1
assiduously 1
checking 1
his 1
sense 1
of 1
sight 1
against 1
his 1
sense 1
of 1
smell 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
more 1
surely 1
keep 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
trail 1
but 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
care 1
night 1
found 1
him 1
at 1
a 1
point 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
positive 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
wrong 1
trail 1
entirely 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
pack 1
would 1
follow 1
his 1
spoor 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
careful 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
as 1
distinct 1
as 1
possible 1
brushing 1
often 1
against 1
the 1
vines 1
and 1
creepers 1
that 1
walled 1
the 1
jungle 1
path 1
and 1
in 1
other 1
ways 1
leaving 1
his 1
scent 1
spoor 1
plainly 1
discernible 1
as 1
darkness 1
settled 1
a 1
heavy 1
rain 1
set 1
in 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
for 1
the 1
baffled 1
ape 1
man 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
wait 1
in 1
the 1
partial 1
shelter 1
of 1
a 1
huge 1
tree 1
until 1
morning 1
but 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
dawn 1
brought 1
no 1
cessation 1
of 1
the 1
torrential 1
downpour 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
obscured 1
by 1
heavy 1
clouds 1
while 1
violent 1
rain 1
and 1
wind 1
storms 1
obliterated 1
the 1
last 1
remnants 1
of 1
the 1
spoor 1
tarzan 1
constantly 1
though 1
vainly 1
sought 1
during 1
all 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
saw 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
natives 1
nor 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
pack 1
the 1
members 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
feared 1
had 1
lost 1
his 1
trail 1
during 1
the 1
terrific 1
storm 1
as 1
the 1
country 1
was 1
strange 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
judge 1
his 1
course 1
accurately 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
neither 1
sun 1
by 1
day 1
nor 1
moon 1
nor 1
stars 1
by 1
night 1
to 1
guide 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
sun 1
at 1
last 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
clouds 1
in 1
the 1
fore 1
noon 1
of 1
the 1
seventh 1
day 1
it 1
looked 1
down 1
upon 1
an 1
almost 1
frantic 1
ape 1
man 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
his 1
life 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
had 1
been 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
that 1
the 1
experience 1
should 1
have 1
befallen 1
him 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
time 1
seemed 1
cruel 1
beyond 1
expression 1
somewhere 1
in 1
this 1
savage 1
land 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
son 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
clutches 1
of 1
the 1
arch 1
fiend 1
rokoff 1
what 1
hideous 1
trials 1
might 1
they 1
not 1
have 1
undergone 1
during 1
those 1
seven 1
awful 1
days 1
that 1
nature 1
had 1
thwarted 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
endeavours 1
to 1
locate 1
them 1
tarzan 1
knew 1
the 1
russian 1
in 1
whose 1
power 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
well 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
filled 1
with 1
rage 1
that 1
jane 1
had 1
once 1
escaped 1
him 1
and 1
knowing 1
that 1
tarzan 1
might 1
be 1
close 1
upon 1
his 1
trail 1
would 1
wreak 1
without 1
further 1
loss 1
of 1
time 1
whatever 1
vengeance 1
his 1
polluted 1
mind 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
conceive 1
but 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
sun 1
shone 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
was 1
still 1
at 1
a 1
loss 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
direction 1
to 1
take 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
rokoff 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
river 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
anderssen 1
but 1
whether 1
he 1
would 1
continue 1
inland 1
or 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
ugambi 1
was 1
a 1
question 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
seen 1
that 1
the 1
river 1
at 1
the 1
point 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
was 1
growing 1
narrow 1
and 1
swift 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
judged 1
that 1
it 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
navigable 1
even 1
for 1
canoes 1
to 1
any 1
great 1
distance 1
farther 1
toward 1
its 1
source 1
however 1
if 1
rokoff 1
had 1
not 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
in 1
what 1
direction 1
had 1
he 1
proceeded 1
from 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
anderssen 1
s 1
flight 1
with 1
jane 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
tarzan 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
had 1
purposed 1
attempting 1
the 1
tremendous 1
feat 1
of 1
crossing 1
the 1
continent 1
to 1
zanzibar 1
but 1
whether 1
rokoff 1
would 1
dare 1
so 1
dangerous 1
a 1
journey 1
or 1
not 1
was 1
a 1
question 1
fear 1
might 1
drive 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
attempt 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
manner 1
of 1
horrible 1
pack 1
that 1
was 1
upon 1
his 1
trail 1
and 1
that 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
was 1
following 1
him 1
to 1
wreak 1
upon 1
him 1
the 1
vengeance 1
that 1
he 1
deserved 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
determined 1
to 1
continue 1
toward 1
the 1
northeast 1
in 1
the 1
general 1
direction 1
of 1
german 1
east 1
africa 1
until 1
he 1
came 1
upon 1
natives 1
from 1
whom 1
he 1
might 1
gain 1
information 1
as 1
to 1
rokoff 1
s 1
whereabouts 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
following 1
the 1
cessation 1
of 1
the 1
rain 1
tarzan 1
came 1
upon 1
a 1
native 1
village 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
of 1
which 1
fled 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
the 1
instant 1
their 1
eyes 1
fell 1
upon 1
him 1
tarzan 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
thwarted 1
in 1
any 1
such 1
manner 1
as 1
this 1
pursued 1
them 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
brief 1
chase 1
caught 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
young 1
warrior 1
the 1
fellow 1
was 1
so 1
badly 1
frightened 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
unable 1
to 1
defend 1
himself 1
dropping 1
his 1
weapons 1
and 1
falling 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
wide 1
eyed 1
and 1
screaming 1
as 1
he 1
gazed 1
on 1
his 1
captor 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
considerable 1
difficulty 1
that 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
quieted 1
the 1
fellow 1
s 1
fears 1
sufficiently 1
to 1
obtain 1
a 1
coherent 1
statement 1
from 1
him 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
uncalled 1
for 1
terror 1
from 1
him 1
tarzan 1
learned 1
by 1
dint 1
of 1
much 1
coaxing 1
that 1
a 1
party 1
of 1
whites 1
had 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
village 1
several 1
days 1
before 1
these 1
men 1
had 1
told 1
them 1
of 1
a 1
terrible 1
white 1
devil 1
that 1
pursued 1
them 1
warning 1
the 1
natives 1
against 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
frightful 1
pack 1
of 1
demons 1
that 1
accompanied 1
it 1
the 1
black 1
had 1
recognized 1
tarzan 1
as 1
the 1
white 1
devil 1
from 1
the 1
descriptions 1
given 1
by 1
the 1
whites 1
and 1
their 1
black 1
servants 1
behind 1
him 1

had 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
horde 1
of 1
demons 1
disguised 1
as 1
apes 1
and 1
panthers 1
in 1

cunning 1

of 1

attempting 1
to 1
make 1
travel 1
as 1
difficult 1
as 1
possible 1
for 1
him 1
by 1
turning 1
the 1
natives 1
against 1
him 1
in 1
superstitious 1
fear 1
the 1
native 1
further 1
told 1
tarzan 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
led 1
the 1
recent 1
expedition 1
had 1
promised 1
them 1
a 1
fabulous 1
reward 1
if 1
they 1
would 1
kill 1
the 1
white 1
devil 1
this 1
they 1
had 1
fully 1
intended 1
doing 1
should 1
the 1
opportunity 1
present 1
itself 1
but 1
the 1
moment 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
tarzan 1
their 1
blood 1
had 1
turned 1
to 1
water 1
as 1
the 1
porters 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
men 1
had 1
told 1
them 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
case 1
finding 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
made 1
no 1
attempt 1
to 1
harm 1
him 1
the 1
native 1
at 1
last 1
recovered 1
his 1
grasp 1
upon 1
his 1
courage 1
and 1
at 1
tarzan 1
s 1
suggestion 1
accompanied 1
the 1
white 1
devil 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
calling 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
for 1
his 1
fellows 1
to 1
return 1
also 1
as 1
the 1
white 1
devil 1
has 1
promised 1
to 1
do 1
you 1
no 1
harm 1
if 1
you 1
come 1
back 1
right 1
away 1
and 1
answer 1
his 1
questions 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
the 1
blacks 1
straggled 1
into 1
the 1
village 1
but 1
that 1
their 1
fears 1
were 1
not 1
entirely 1
allayed 1
was 1
evident 1
from 1
the 1
amount 1
of 1
white 1
that 1
showed 1
about 1
the 1
eyes 1
of 1
the 1
majority 1
of 1
them 1
as 1
they 1
cast 1
constant 1
and 1
apprehensive 1
sidelong 1
glances 1
at 1
the 1
ape 1

was 1
among 1

first 1
to 1
return 1

as 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
tarzan 1
was 1
most 1
anxious 1
to 1
interview 1

lost 1
no 1
time 1

into 1

palaver 1
with 1

fellow 1
was 1
short 1
and 1
stout 1
with 1
an 1
unusually 1
low 1
and 1
degraded 1
countenance 1
and 1
apelike 1
arms 1
his 1
whole 1
expression 1
denoted 1
deceitfulness 1
only 1
the 1
superstitious 1
terror 1
engendered 1
in 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
stories 1
poured 1
into 1
his 1
ears 1
by 1
the 1
whites 1
and 1
blacks 1
of 1

him 1
from 1
leaping 1
upon 1
tarzan 1
with 1
his 1
warriors 1
and 1
slaying 1
him 1
forthwith 1
for 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
people 1
were 1
inveterate 1
maneaters 1
but 1
the 1
fear 1
that 1

might 1
indeed 1

from 1
putting 1
his 1
desires 1
into 1
action 1
tarzan 1
questioned 1
the 1
fellow 1
closely 1
and 1
by 1
comparing 1
his 1
statements 1
with 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
warrior 1

had 1
first 1
talked 1
with 1

learned 1
that 1

were 1
in 1

stricken 1

in 1

of 1
the 1
far 1
east 1
coast 1

of 1

porters 1
had 1
already 1
deserted 1

in 1
that 1
very 1
village 1

had 1
hanged 1
five 1
for 1
theft 1
and 1
attempted 1
desertion 1

however 1
from 1
what 1

waganwazam 1
had 1
learned 1
from 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
blacks 1
who 1
were 1
not 1
too 1
far 1
gone 1
in 1
terror 1
of 1

brutal 1
rokoff 1
to 1
fear 1
even 1
to 1
speak 1
of 1
their 1
plans 1
it 1
was 1
apparent 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
travel 1
any 1
great 1
distance 1
before 1

last 1
of 1

gun 1
bearers 1

and 1
even 1
his 1
headman 1
would 1
have 1
turned 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
leaving 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
the 1
merciless 1
jungle 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
denied 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
any 1
white 1
woman 1
or 1
child 1
with 1
the 1
party 1
of 1
whites 1
but 1
even 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
tarzan 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
he 1
lied 1
several 1
times 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
approached 1
the 1
subject 1
from 1
different 1
angles 1
but 1
never 1
was 1
he 1
successful 1
in 1
surprising 1
the 1
wily 1
cannibal 1
into 1
a 1
direct 1
contradiction 1
of 1
his 1
original 1
statement 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
no 1
women 1
or 1
children 1
with 1
the 1
party 1
tarzan 1
demanded 1
food 1
of 1
the 1
chief 1
and 1
after 1
considerable 1
haggling 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
monarch 1
succeeded 1
in 1
obtaining 1
a 1
meal 1
he 1
then 1
tried 1
to 1
draw 1
out 1
others 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
especially 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
captured 1
in 1
the 1
bush 1
but 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
s 1
presence 1
sealed 1
their 1
lips 1
at 1
last 1
convinced 1
that 1
these 1
people 1
knew 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
more 1
than 1
they 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
concerning 1
the 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
and 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
jane 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
tarzan 1
determined 1
to 1
remain 1
overnight 1
among 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
discovering 1
something 1
further 1
of 1
importance 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
stated 1
his 1
decision 1
to 1
the 1
chief 1
he 1
was 1
rather 1
surprised 1
to 1
note 1
the 1
sudden 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
fellow 1
s 1
attitude 1
toward 1
him 1
from 1
apparent 1
dislike 1
and 1
suspicion 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
became 1
a 1
most 1
eager 1
and 1
solicitous 1
host 1
nothing 1
would 1
do 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
should 1
occupy 1
the 1
best 1
hut 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
from 1
which 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
s 1
oldest 1
wife 1
was 1
forthwith 1
summarily 1
ejected 1
while 1
the 1
chief 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
temporary 1
abode 1
in 1
the 1
hut 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
younger 1
consorts 1
had 1
tarzan 1
chanced 1
to 1
recall 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
a 1
princely 1
reward 1
had 1
been 1
offered 1
the 1
blacks 1
if 1
they 1
should 1
succeed 1
in 1
killing 1
him 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
more 1
quickly 1
interpreted 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
s 1
sudden 1
change 1
in 1
front 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
white 1
giant 1
sleeping 1
peacefully 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
huts 1
would 1
greatly 1
facilitate 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
earning 1
the 1
reward 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
chief 1
was 1
urgent 1
in 1
his 1
suggestions 1
that 1
tarzan 1
doubtless 1
being 1
very 1
much 1
fatigued 1
after 1
his 1
travels 1
should 1
retire 1
early 1
to 1
the 1
comforts 1
of 1
the 1
anything 1
but 1
inviting 1
palace 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
detested 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
sleeping 1
within 1
a 1
native 1
hut 1
he 1
had 1
determined 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
this 1
night 1
on 1
the 1
chance 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
induce 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
younger 1
men 1
to 1
sit 1
and 1
chat 1
with 1
him 1
before 1
the 1
fire 1
that 1
burned 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
smoke 1
filled 1
dwelling 1
and 1
from 1
him 1
draw 1
the 1
truths 1
he 1
sought 1
so 1
tarzan 1
accepted 1
the 1
invitation 1
of 1
old 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
insisting 1
however 1
that 1
he 1
much 1
preferred 1
sharing 1
a 1
hut 1
with 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
younger 1
men 1
rather 1
than 1
driving 1
the 1
chief 1
s 1
old 1
wife 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
the 1
toothless 1
old 1
hag 1
grinned 1
her 1
appreciation 1
of 1
this 1
suggestion 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
plan 1
still 1
better 1
suited 1
the 1
chief 1
s 1
scheme 1
in 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
surround 1
tarzan 1
with 1
a 1
gang 1
of 1
picked 1
assassins 1
he 1
readily 1
assented 1
so 1
that 1
presently 1
tarzan 1
had 1
been 1
installed 1
in 1
a 1
hut 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
gate 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
dance 1
that 1
night 1
in 1
honour 1
of 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
recently 1
returned 1
hunters 1
tarzan 1
was 1
left 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
hut 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
as 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
explained 1
having 1
to 1
take 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
festivities 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
was 1
safely 1
installed 1
in 1
the 1
trap 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
called 1
about 1
him 1
the 1
young 1
warriors 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
selected 1
to 1
spend 1
the 1
night 1
with 1
the 1
white 1
devil 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
overly 1
enthusiastic 1
about 1
the 1
plan 1
since 1
deep 1
in 1
their 1
superstitious 1
hearts 1
lay 1
an 1
exaggerated 1
fear 1
of 1
the 1
strange 1
white 1
giant 1
but 1
the 1
word 1
of 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
was 1
law 1
among 1
his 1
people 1
so 1
not 1
one 1
dared 1
refuse 1
the 1
duty 1
he 1
was 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
perform 1
as 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
unfolded 1
his 1
plan 1
in 1
whispers 1
to 1
the 1
savages 1
squatting 1
about 1
him 1
the 1
old 1
toothless 1
hag 1
to 1
whom 1
tarzan 1
had 1
saved 1
her 1
hut 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
hovered 1
about 1
the 1
conspirators 1
ostensibly 1
to 1
replenish 1
the 1
supply 1
of 1
firewood 1
for 1
the 1
blaze 1
about 1
which 1
the 1
men 1
sat 1
but 1
really 1
to 1
drink 1
in 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
their 1
conversation 1
as 1
possible 1
tarzan 1
had 1
slept 1
for 1
perhaps 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
two 1
despite 1
the 1
savage 1
din 1
of 1
the 1
revellers 1
when 1
his 1
keen 1
senses 1
came 1
suddenly 1
alert 1
to 1
a 1
suspiciously 1
stealthy 1
movement 1
in 1
the 1
hut 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
lay 1
the 1
fire 1
had 1
died 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
heap 1
of 1
glowing 1
embers 1
which 1
accentuated 1
rather 1
than 1
relieved 1
the 1
darkness 1
that 1
shrouded 1
the 1
interior 1
of 1
the 1
evil 1
smelling 1
dwelling 1
yet 1
the 1
trained 1
senses 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
warned 1
him 1
of 1
another 1
presence 1
creeping 1
almost 1
silently 1
toward 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
he 1
doubted 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
hut 1
mates 1
returning 1
from 1
the 1
festivities 1
for 1
he 1
still 1
heard 1
the 1
wild 1
cries 1
of 1
the 1
dancers 1
and 1
the 1
din 1
of 1
the 1
tom 1
toms 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
without 1
who 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
that 1
took 1
such 1
pains 1
to 1
conceal 1
his 1
approach 1
as 1
the 1
presence 1
came 1
within 1
reach 1
of 1
him 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
bounded 1
lightly 1
to 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
his 1
spear 1
poised 1
ready 1
at 1
his 1
side 1
who 1
is 1
it 1
he 1
asked 1
that 1
creeps 1
upon 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
like 1
a 1
hungry 1
lion 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
darkness 1

replied 1
an 1
old 1
cracked 1
voice 1
it 1
is 1
tambudza 1
she 1
whose 1
hut 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
take 1
and 1
thus 1
drive 1
an 1
old 1
woman 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
cold 1
night 1
what 1
does 1
tambudza 1
want 1
of 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
asked 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1

were 1
kind 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
whom 1
none 1

kind 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
warn 1

of 1

old 1
hag 1

me 1
of 1
what 1
m 1
ganwazam 1

chosen 1

young 1
men 1
who 1
are 1
to 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
hut 1
with 1
you 1
replied 1
tambudza 1
i 1
was 1
near 1
as 1
he 1
talked 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
heard 1
him 1
issuing 1
his 1
instructions 1
to 1
them 1
when 1
the 1
dance 1
is 1
run 1
well 1
into 1
the 1
morning 1
they 1
are 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
hut 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
awake 1
they 1
are 1
to 1
pretend 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
sleep 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
sleep 1
it 1
is 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
s 1
command 1
that 1
you 1
be 1
killed 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
then 1
asleep 1
they 1
will 1
wait 1
quietly 1
beside 1
you 1
until 1
you 1
do 1
sleep 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
will 1
all 1
fall 1
upon 1
you 1
together 1
and 1
slay 1
you 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
is 1
determined 1
to 1
win 1
the 1
reward 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
has 1
offered 1
i 1
had 1
forgotten 1
the 1
reward 1
said 1
tarzan 1
half 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
added 1
how 1
may 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
hope 1
to 1
collect 1
the 1
reward 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
men 1
who 1
are 1
my 1
enemies 1
have 1
left 1
his 1
country 1
and 1
gone 1
he 1
knows 1
not 1
where 1
oh 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
replied 1
tambudza 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
knows 1
where 1
they 1
camp 1
his 1
runners 1
could 1
quickly 1
overtake 1
them 1
they 1
move 1
slowly 1
where 1
are 1
they 1
asked 1
tarzan 1
do 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
them 1
asked 1
tambudza 1
in 1
way 1
of 1
reply 1
tarzan 1
nodded 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
you 1
where 1
they 1
lie 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
yourself 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
lead 1
you 1
to 1
them 1
bwana 1
in 1
their 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
conversation 1
neither 1
of 1
the 1
speakers 1
had 1
noticed 1
the 1
little 1
figure 1
which 1
crept 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
behind 1
them 1
nor 1
did 1
they 1
see 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
slunk 1
noiselessly 1
out 1
again 1
it 1
was 1
little 1
buulaoo 1
the 1
chief 1
s 1
son 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
younger 1
wives 1
a 1
vindictive 1
degenerate 1
little 1
rascal 1
who 1
hated 1
tambudza 1
and 1
was 1
ever 1
seeking 1
opportunities 1
to 1
spy 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
report 1
her 1
slightest 1
breach 1
of 1
custom 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
come 1
then 1
said 1
tarzan 1
quickly 1
let 1
us 1
be 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
this 1
buulaoo 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
already 1
legging 1
it 1
up 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
to 1
where 1
his 1
hideous 1
sire 1
guzzled 1
native 1
beer 1
and 1
watched 1
the 1
evolutions 1
of 1
the 1
frantic 1
dancers 1
leaping 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
cavorting 1
wildly 1
in 1
their 1
hysterical 1
capers 1
so 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
as 1
tarzan 1
and 1
tambudza 1
sneaked 1
warily 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
melted 1
into 1
the 1
stygian 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
two 1
lithe 1
runners 1
took 1
their 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
direction 1
though 1
by 1
another 1
trail 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
sufficiently 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
safe 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
speak 1
above 1
a 1
whisper 1
tarzan 1
asked 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
aught 1
of 1
a 1
white 1
woman 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
yes 1
bwana 1
replied 1
tambudza 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
woman 1
with 1
them 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
a 1
little 1
white 1
piccaninny 1
it 1
died 1
here 1
in 1
our 1
village 1
of 1
the 1
fever 1
and 1
they 1
buried 1
it 1
chapter 1
12 1
a 1
black 1
scoundrel 1
when 1
jane 1
clayton 1
regained 1
consciousness 1
she 1
saw 1
anderssen 1
standing 1
over 1
her 1
holding 1
the 1
baby 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
as 1
her 1
eyes 1
rested 1
upon 1
them 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
misery 1
and 1
horror 1
overspread 1
her 1
countenance 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
he 1
asked 1
you 1
ban 1
sick 1
where 1
is 1
my 1
baby 1
she 1
cried 1
ignoring 1
his 1
questions 1
anderssen 1
held 1
out 1
the 1
chubby 1
infant 1
but 1
she 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
mine 1
she 1
said 1
you 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
mine 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
devil 1
like 1
the 1
russian 1
anderssen 1
s 1
blue 1
eyes 1
stretched 1
in 1
surprise 1
not 1
yours 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
you 1

kid 1

kincaid 1

replied 1
jane 1
dully 1
the 1
other 1
where 1
is 1
the 1
other 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
two 1
i 1

not 1

about 1

tank 1
this 1
ban 1
yours 1
ay 1
am 1
very 1
sorry 1
anderssen 1
fidgeted 1
about 1
standing 1
first 1
on 1
one 1
foot 1
and 1
then 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
evident 1
to 1
jane 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
honest 1
in 1
his 1
protestations 1
of 1
ignorance 1
of 1
the 1
true 1
identity 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
presently 1
the 1
baby 1
commenced 1
to 1
crow 1
and 1
bounce 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
swede 1
s 1
arms 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
leaning 1
forward 1
with 1
little 1
hands 1
out 1
reaching 1
toward 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
withstand 1
the 1
appeal 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
low 1
cry 1
she 1
sprang 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
gathered 1
the 1
baby 1
to 1
her 1
breast 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
she 1
wept 1
silently 1
her 1
face 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
baby 1
s 1
soiled 1
little 1
dress 1
the 1
first 1
shock 1
of 1
disappointment 1
that 1
the 1
tiny 1
thing 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
her 1
beloved 1
jack 1
was 1
giving 1
way 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
hope 1
that 1
after 1
all 1
some 1
miracle 1
had 1
occurred 1
to 1
snatch 1
her 1
baby 1
from 1
rokoff 1
s 1
hands 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
instant 1
before 1
the 1
kincaid 1
sailed 1
from 1
england 1
then 1
too 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
mute 1
appeal 1
of 1
this 1
wee 1
waif 1
alone 1
and 1
unloved 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
the 1
horrors 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
jungle 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
thought 1
more 1
than 1
any 1
other 1
that 1
had 1
sent 1
her 1
mother 1
s 1
heart 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
innocent 1
babe 1
while 1
still 1
she 1
suffered 1
from 1
disappointment 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
deceived 1
in 1
its 1
identity 1
have 1
you 1
no 1
idea 1
whose 1
child 1
this 1
is 1
she 1
asked 1
anderssen 1
the 1
man 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
not 1
now 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
ban 1
your 1
kid 1
ay 1
don 1
know 1
whose 1
kid 1
he 1
do 1
ban 1
rokoff 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
yours 1
ay 1
tank 1
he 1
tank 1
so 1
too 1
what 1
do 1
we 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
now 1
ay 1
can 1
t 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
kincaid 1
rokoff 1
would 1
have 1
me 1
shot 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
go 1
back 1
ay 1
take 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
then 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
black 1
men 1
they 1
take 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
ship 1
eh 1
no 1
no 1
cried 1
jane 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
would 1
rather 1
die 1
than 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
that 1
man 1
again 1
no 1
let 1
us 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
take 1
this 1
poor 1
little 1
creature 1
with 1
us 1
if 1
god 1
is 1
willing 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
saved 1
in 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
another 1
so 1
they 1
again 1
took 1
up 1
their 1
flight 1
through 1
the 1
wilderness 1
taking 1
with 1
them 1
a 1
half 1
dozen 1
of 1
the 1
mosulas 1
to 1
carry 1
provisions 1
and 1
the 1
tents 1
that 1
anderssen 1
had 1
smuggled 1
aboard 1
the 1
small 1
boat 1
in 1
preparation 1
for 1
the 1
attempted 1
escape 1
the 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
of 1
torture 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
suffered 1
were 1
so 1
merged 1
into 1
one 1
long 1
unbroken 1
nightmare 1
of 1
hideousness 1
that 1
she 1
soon 1
lost 1
all 1
track 1
of 1
time 1
whether 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
wandering 1
for 1
days 1
or 1
years 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
the 1
one 1
bright 1
spot 1
in 1
that 1
eternity 1
of 1
fear 1
and 1
suffering 1
was 1
the 1
little 1
child 1
whose 1
tiny 1
hands 1
had 1
long 1
since 1
fastened 1
their 1
softly 1
groping 1
fingers 1
firmly 1
about 1
her 1
heart 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
the 1
little 1
thing 1
took 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
filled 1
the 1
aching 1
void 1
that 1
the 1
theft 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
baby 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
could 1
never 1
be 1
the 1
same 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
yet 1
day 1
by 1
day 1
she 1
found 1
her 1
mother 1
love 1
enveloping 1
the 1
waif 1
more 1
closely 1
until 1
she 1
sometimes 1
sat 1
with 1
closed 1
eyes 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
sweet 1
imagining 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
bundle 1
of 1
humanity 1
at 1
her 1
breast 1
was 1
truly 1
her 1
own 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
their 1
progress 1
inland 1
was 1
extremely 1
slow 1
word 1
came 1
to 1
them 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
through 1
natives 1
passing 1
from 1
the 1
coast 1
on 1
hunting 1
excursions 1
that 1
rokoff 1
had 1
not 1
yet 1
guessed 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
their 1
flight 1
this 1
and 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
journey 1
as 1
light 1
as 1
possible 1
for 1
the 1
gently 1
bred 1
woman 1
kept 1
anderssen 1
to 1
a 1
slow 1
advance 1
of 1
short 1
and 1
easy 1
marches 1
with 1
many 1
rests 1
the 1
swede 1
insisted 1
upon 1
carrying 1
the 1
child 1
while 1
they 1
travelled 1
and 1
in 1
countless 1
other 1
ways 1
did 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
help 1
jane 1
clayton 1
conserve 1
her 1
strength 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
terribly 1
chagrined 1
on 1
discovering 1
the 1
mistake 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
in 1
the 1
identity 1
of 1
the 1
baby 1
but 1
once 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
became 1
convinced 1
that 1
his 1
motives 1
were 1
truly 1
chivalrous 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
permit 1
him 1
longer 1
to 1
upbraid 1
himself 1
for 1
the 1
error 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
by 1
any 1
means 1
have 1
avoided 1
at 1
the 1
close 1
of 1
each 1
day 1
s 1
march 1
anderssen 1
saw 1
to 1
the 1
erection 1
of 1
a 1
comfortable 1
shelter 1
for 1
jane 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
her 1
tent 1
was 1
always 1
pitched 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
favourable 1
location 1
the 1
thorn 1
boma 1
round 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
strongest 1
and 1
most 1
impregnable 1
that 1
the 1
mosula 1
could 1
construct 1
her 1
food 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
that 1
their 1
limited 1
stores 1
and 1
the 1
rifle 1
of 1
the 1
swede 1
could 1
provide 1
but 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
touched 1
her 1
heart 1
the 1
closest 1
was 1
the 1
gentle 1
consideration 1
and 1
courtesy 1
which 1
the 1
man 1
always 1
accorded 1
her 1
that 1
such 1
nobility 1
of 1
character 1
could 1
lie 1
beneath 1
so 1
repulsive 1
an 1
exterior 1
never 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
source 1
of 1
wonder 1
and 1
amazement 1
to 1
her 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
innate 1
chivalry 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
unfailing 1
kindliness 1
and 1
sympathy 1
transformed 1
his 1
appearance 1
in 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
jane 1
was 1
concerned 1
until 1
she 1
saw 1
only 1
the 1
sweetness 1
of 1
his 1
character 1
mirrored 1
in 1
his 1
countenance 1
they 1
had 1
commenced 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
little 1
better 1
progress 1
when 1
word 1
reached 1
them 1
that 1
rokoff 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
marches 1
behind 1
them 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
at 1
last 1
discovered 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
their 1
flight 1
it 1
was 1
then 1
that 1
anderssen 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
river 1
purchasing 1
a 1
canoe 1
from 1
a 1
chief 1
whose 1
village 1
lay 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
ugambi 1
upon 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
a 1
tributary 1
thereafter 1
the 1
little 1
party 1
of 1
fugitives 1
fled 1
up 1
the 1
broad 1
ugambi 1
and 1
so 1
rapid 1
had 1
their 1
flight 1
become 1
that 1
they 1
no 1
longer 1
received 1
word 1
of 1
their 1
pursuers 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
canoe 1
navigation 1
upon 1
the 1
river 1
they 1
abandoned 1
their 1
canoe 1
and 1
took 1
to 1
the 1
jungle 1
here 1
progress 1
became 1
at 1
once 1
arduous 1
slow 1
and 1
dangerous 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
after 1
leaving 1
the 1
ugambi 1
the 1
baby 1
fell 1
ill 1
with 1
fever 1
anderssen 1
knew 1
what 1
the 1
outcome 1
must 1
be 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
heart 1
to 1
tell 1
jane 1
clayton 1
the 1
truth 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
love 1
the 1
child 1
almost 1
as 1
passionately 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
her 1
own 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
as 1
the 1
baby 1
s 1
condition 1
precluded 1
farther 1
advance 1
anderssen 1
withdrew 1
a 1
little 1
from 1
the 1
main 1
trail 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
following 1
and 1
built 1
a 1
camp 1
in 1
a 1
natural 1
clearing 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
river 1
here 1
jane 1
devoted 1
her 1
every 1
moment 1
to 1
caring 1
for 1
the 1
tiny 1
sufferer 1
and 1
as 1
though 1
her 1
sorrow 1
and 1
anxiety 1
were 1
not 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
bear 1
a 1
further 1
blow 1
came 1
with 1
the 1
sudden 1
announcement 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
mosula 1
porters 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
foraging 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
adjacent 1
that 1
rokoff 1
and 1
his 1
party 1
were 1
camped 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
were 1
evidently 1
upon 1
their 1
trail 1
to 1
this 1
little 1
nook 1
which 1
all 1
had 1
thought 1
so 1
excellent 1
a 1
hiding 1
place 1
this 1
information 1
could 1
mean 1
but 1
one 1
thing 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
break 1
camp 1
and 1
fly 1
onward 1
regardless 1
of 1
the 1
baby 1
s 1
condition 1
jane 1
clayton 1
knew 1
the 1
traits 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
well 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
positive 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
separate 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
child 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
he 1
recaptured 1
them 1
and 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
separation 1
would 1
mean 1
the 1
immediate 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
baby 1
as 1
they 1
stumbled 1
forward 1
through 1
the 1
tangled 1
vegetation 1
along 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
almost 1
overgrown 1
game 1
trail 1
the 1
mosula 1
porters 1
deserted 1
them 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
the 1
men 1
had 1
been 1
staunch 1
enough 1
in 1
their 1
devotion 1
and 1
loyalty 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
no 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
overtaken 1
by 1
the 1
russian 1
and 1
his 1
party 1
they 1
had 1
heard 1
however 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
atrocious 1
disposition 1
of 1
rokoff 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
grown 1
to 1
hold 1
him 1
in 1
mortal 1
terror 1
and 1
now 1
that 1
they 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
close 1
upon 1
them 1
their 1
timid 1
hearts 1
would 1
fortify 1
them 1
no 1
longer 1
and 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
possible 1
they 1
deserted 1
the 1
three 1
whites 1
yet 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
went 1
anderssen 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
the 1
swede 1
went 1
ahead 1
to 1
hew 1
a 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
brush 1
where 1
the 1
path 1
was 1
entirely 1
overgrown 1
so 1
that 1
on 1
this 1
march 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
carry 1
the 1
child 1
all 1
day 1
they 1
marched 1
late 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
they 1
realized 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
failed 1
close 1
behind 1
them 1
they 1
heard 1
the 1
noise 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
safari 1
advancing 1
along 1
the 1
trail 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
cleared 1
for 1
their 1
pursuers 1
when 1
it 1
became 1
quite 1
evident 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
overtaken 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
anderssen 1
hid 1
jane 1
behind 1
a 1
large 1
tree 1
covering 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
with 1
brush 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
village 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
farther 1
on 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1

asked 1
jane 1
and 1
yet 1
in 1
her 1
heart 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
exactly 1
what 1
the 1
great 1
scoundrel 1
would 1
do 1
in 1
revenge 1
for 1
his 1
having 1
been 1
thwarted 1
by 1
the 1
swede 1
anderssen 1
did 1
not 1
reply 1
other 1
than 1
to 1
warn 1
her 1
to 1
silence 1
and 1
point 1

some 1
means 1
of 1

anderssen 1
they 1
would 1
only 1

and 1
then 1
ay 1
couldn 1

kid 1
lady 1
and 1
what 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
for 1
you 1
both 1
to 1
fall 1
into 1
rokoff 1

and 1
ammunition 1

he 1
shoved 1
the 1
gun 1
and 1
bandoleer 1
into 1
the 1
shelter 1
beside 1
jane 1
then 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
she 1
watched 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
returned 1
along 1
the 1
path 1
to 1
meet 1
the 1
oncoming 1
safari 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
soon 1
a 1
turn 1
in 1
the 1
trail 1
hid 1
him 1
from 1
view 1
her 1
first 1
impulse 1
was 1
to 1
follow 1
with 1
the 1
rifle 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
of 1
assistance 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
further 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
the 1
terrible 1
thought 1
of 1
being 1
left 1
alone 1
at 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
the 1
fearful 1
jungle 1
without 1
a 1
single 1
friend 1
to 1
aid 1
her 1
she 1
started 1
to 1
crawl 1
from 1
her 1
shelter 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
running 1
after 1
anderssen 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
as 1
she 1
drew 1
the 1
baby 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
she 1
glanced 1
down 1
into 1
its 1
little 1
face 1
how 1
red 1
it 1
was 1
how 1
unnatural 1
the 1
little 1
thing 1
looked 1
she 1
raised 1
the 1
cheek 1
to 1
hers 1
it 1
was 1
fiery 1
hot 1
with 1
fever 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
gasp 1
of 1
terror 1
jane 1
clayton 1
rose 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
path 1
the 1
rifle 1
and 1
bandoleer 1
lay 1
forgotten 1
in 1
the 1
shelter 1
beside 1
her 1
anderssen 1
was 1
forgotten 1
and 1
rokoff 1
and 1
her 1
great 1
peril 1
all 1
that 1
rioted 1
through 1
her 1
fear 1
mad 1
brain 1
was 1
the 1
fearful 1
fact 1
that 1
this 1
little 1
helpless 1
child 1
was 1
stricken 1
with 1
the 1
terrible 1
jungle 1
fever 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
helpless 1
to 1
do 1
aught 1
to 1
allay 1
its 1
sufferings 1
sufferings 1
that 1
were 1
sure 1
to 1
come 1
during 1
ensuing 1
intervals 1
of 1
partial 1
consciousness 1
her 1
one 1
thought 1
was 1
to 1
find 1
some 1
one 1
who 1
could 1
help 1
her 1
some 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
had 1
children 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
came 1
recollection 1
of 1
the 1
friendly 1
village 1
of 1
which 1
anderssen 1
had 1
spoken 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
but 1
reach 1
it 1
in 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
lost 1
like 1
a 1
startled 1
antelope 1
she 1
turned 1
and 1
fled 1
up 1
the 1
trail 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
anderssen 1
had 1
indicated 1
from 1
far 1
behind 1
came 1
the 1
sudden 1
shouting 1
of 1
men 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
shots 1
and 1
then 1
silence 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
anderssen 1
had 1
met 1
the 1
russian 1
a 1
half 1
hour 1
later 1
she 1
stumbled 1
exhausted 1
into 1
a 1
little 1
thatched 1
village 1
instantly 1
she 1
was 1
surrounded 1
by 1
men 1
women 1
and 1
children 1
eager 1
curious 1
excited 1
natives 1
plied 1
her 1
with 1
a 1
hundred 1
questions 1
no 1
one 1
of 1
which 1
she 1
could 1
understand 1
or 1
answer 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
point 1
tearfully 1
at 1
the 1
baby 1
now 1
wailing 1
piteously 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
and 1
repeat 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
fever 1
fever 1
fever 1
the 1
blacks 1
did 1
not 1
understand 1
her 1
words 1
but 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
her 1
trouble 1
and 1
soon 1
a 1
young 1
woman 1
had 1
pulled 1
her 1
into 1
a 1
hut 1
and 1
with 1
several 1
others 1
was 1
doing 1
her 1
poor 1
best 1
to 1
quiet 1
the 1
child 1
and 1
allay 1
its 1
agony 1
the 1
witch 1
doctor 1
came 1
and 1
built 1
a 1
little 1
fire 1
before 1
the 1
infant 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
boiled 1
some 1
strange 1
concoction 1
in 1
a 1
small 1
earthen 1
pot 1
making 1
weird 1
passes 1
above 1
it 1
and 1
mumbling 1
strange 1
monotonous 1
chants 1
presently 1
he 1
dipped 1
a 1
zebra 1
s 1
tail 1
into 1
the 1
brew 1
and 1
with 1
further 1
mutterings 1
and 1
incantations 1
sprinkled 1
a 1
few 1
drops 1
of 1
the 1
liquid 1
over 1
the 1
baby 1
s 1
face 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
the 1
women 1
sat 1
about 1
and 1
moaned 1
and 1
wailed 1
until 1
jane 1
thought 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
go 1
mad 1
but 1
knowing 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
doing 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
kindness 1
of 1
their 1
hearts 1
she 1
endured 1
the 1
frightful 1
waking 1
nightmare 1
of 1
those 1
awful 1
hours 1
in 1
dumb 1
and 1
patient 1
suffering 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
well 1
toward 1
midnight 1
that 1
she 1
became 1
conscious 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
commotion 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
she 1
heard 1
the 1
voices 1
of 1
the 1
natives 1
raised 1
in 1
controversy 1
but 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
the 1
words 1
presently 1
she 1
heard 1
footsteps 1
approaching 1
the 1
hut 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
squatted 1
before 1
a 1
bright 1
fire 1
with 1
the 1
baby 1
on 1
her 1
lap 1
the 1
little 1
thing 1
lay 1
very 1
still 1
now 1
its 1
lids 1
half 1
raised 1
showed 1
the 1
pupils 1
horribly 1
upturned 1
jane 1
clayton 1
looked 1
into 1
the 1
little 1
face 1
with 1
fear 1
haunted 1
eyes 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
baby 1
not 1
her 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood 1
but 1
how 1
close 1
how 1
dear 1
the 1
tiny 1
helpless 1
thing 1
had 1
become 1
to 1
her 1
her 1
heart 1
bereft 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
to 1
this 1
poor 1
little 1
nameless 1
waif 1
and 1
lavished 1
upon 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
love 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
denied 1
her 1
during 1
the 1
long 1
bitter 1
weeks 1
of 1
her 1
captivity 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
end 1
was 1
near 1
and 1
though 1
she 1
was 1
terrified 1
at 1
contemplation 1
of 1
her 1
loss 1
still 1
she 1
hoped 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
come 1
quickly 1
now 1
and 1
end 1
the 1
sufferings 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
victim 1
the 1
footsteps 1
she 1
had 1
heard 1
without 1
the 1
hut 1
now 1
halted 1
before 1
the 1
door 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
whispered 1
colloquy 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
chief 1
of 1
the 1
tribe 1
entered 1
she 1
had 1
seen 1
but 1
little 1
of 1
him 1
as 1
the 1
women 1
had 1
taken 1
her 1
in 1
hand 1
almost 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
entered 1
the 1
village 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
she 1
now 1
saw 1
was 1
an 1
evil 1
appearing 1
savage 1
with 1
every 1
mark 1
of 1
brutal 1
degeneracy 1
writ 1
large 1
upon 1
his 1
bestial 1
countenance 1
to 1
jane 1
clayton 1
he 1
looked 1
more 1
gorilla 1
than 1
human 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
converse 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
and 1
finally 1
he 1
called 1
to 1
some 1
one 1
without 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
his 1
summons 1
another 1
negro 1
entered 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
very 1
different 1
appearance 1
from 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
so 1
different 1
in 1
fact 1
that 1
jane 1
clayton 1
immediately 1
decided 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
of 1
another 1
tribe 1
this 1
man 1
acted 1
as 1
interpreter 1
and 1
almost 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
question 1
that 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
put 1
to 1
her 1
jane 1
felt 1
an 1
intuitive 1
conviction 1
that 1
the 1
savage 1
was 1
attempting 1
to 1
draw 1
information 1
from 1
her 1
for 1
some 1
ulterior 1
motive 1
she 1
thought 1
it 1
strange 1
that 1
the 1
fellow 1
should 1
so 1
suddenly 1
have 1
become 1
interested 1
in 1
her 1
plans 1
and 1
especially 1
in 1
her 1
intended 1
destination 1
when 1
her 1
journey 1
had 1
been 1
interrupted 1
at 1
his 1
village 1
seeing 1
no 1
reason 1
for 1
withholding 1
the 1
information 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
truth 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
asked 1
if 1
she 1
expected 1
to 1
meet 1
her 1
husband 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
trip 1
she 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
negatively 1
then 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
his 1
visit 1
talking 1
through 1
the 1
interpreter 1
i 1
have 1
just 1
learned 1
he 1
said 1
from 1
some 1
men 1
who 1
live 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
water 1
that 1
your 1
husband 1
followed 1
you 1
up 1
the 1
ugambi 1
for 1
several 1
marches 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
last 1
set 1
upon 1
by 1
natives 1
and 1
killed 1
therefore 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
this 1
that 1
you 1
might 1
not 1
waste 1
your 1
time 1
in 1
a 1
long 1
journey 1
if 1
you 1
expected 1
to 1
meet 1
your 1
husband 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
instead 1
could 1
turn 1
and 1
retrace 1
your 1
steps 1
to 1
the 1
coast 1
jane 1
thanked 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
for 1
his 1
kindness 1
though 1
her 1
heart 1
was 1
numb 1
with 1
suffering 1
at 1
this 1
new 1
blow 1
she 1
who 1
had 1
suffered 1
so 1
much 1
was 1
at 1
last 1
beyond 1
reach 1
of 1
the 1
keenest 1
of 1
misery 1
s 1
pangs 1
for 1
her 1
senses 1
were 1
numbed 1
and 1
calloused 1
with 1
bowed 1
head 1
she 1
sat 1
staring 1
with 1
unseeing 1
eyes 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
baby 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
hut 1
sometime 1
later 1
she 1
heard 1
a 1
noise 1
at 1
the 1
entrance 1
another 1
had 1
entered 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
sitting 1
opposite 1
her 1
threw 1
a 1
faggot 1
upon 1
the 1
dying 1
embers 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
between 1
them 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
flare 1
it 1
burst 1
into 1
renewed 1
flame 1
lighting 1
up 1
the 1
hut 1
s 1
interior 1
as 1
though 1
by 1
magic 1
the 1
flame 1
disclosed 1
to 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
horrified 1
gaze 1
that 1
the 1
baby 1
was 1
quite 1
dead 1
how 1
long 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
guess 1
a 1
choking 1
lump 1
rose 1
to 1
her 1
throat 1
her 1
head 1
drooped 1
in 1
silent 1
misery 1
upon 1
the 1
little 1
bundle 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
caught 1
suddenly 1
to 1
her 1
breast 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
was 1
unbroken 1
then 1
the 1
native 1
woman 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
hideous 1
wail 1
a 1
man 1
coughed 1
close 1
before 1
jane 1
clayton 1
and 1
spoke 1
her 1
name 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
she 1
raised 1
her 1
eyes 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
the 1
sardonic 1
countenance 1
of 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
chapter 1
13 1
escape 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
rokoff 1
stood 1
sneering 1
down 1
upon 1
jane 1
clayton 1
then 1
his 1
eyes 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
bundle 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
jane 1
had 1
drawn 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
blanket 1
over 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
face 1
so 1
that 1
to 1
one 1
who 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
truth 1
it 1
seemed 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
sleeping 1
you 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
unnecessary 1
trouble 1
said 1
rokoff 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
child 1
to 1
this 1
village 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
attended 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
affairs 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
brought 1
it 1
here 1
myself 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
spared 1
the 1
dangers 1
and 1
fatigue 1
of 1
the 1
journey 1
but 1
i 1
suppose 1
i 1
must 1
thank 1
you 1
for 1
relieving 1
me 1
of 1
the 1
inconvenience 1
of 1
having 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
a 1
young 1
infant 1
on 1
the 1
march 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
village 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
destined 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
will 1
rear 1
him 1
carefully 1
making 1
a 1
good 1
cannibal 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
ever 1
chance 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
civilization 1
it 1
will 1
doubtless 1
afford 1
you 1
much 1
food 1
for 1
thought 1
as 1
you 1
compare 1
the 1
luxuries 1
and 1
comforts 1
of 1
your 1
life 1
with 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
the 1
life 1
your 1
son 1
is 1
living 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
the 1
waganwazam 1
again 1
i 1
thank 1
you 1
for 1
bringing 1
him 1
here 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
must 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
surrender 1
him 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
turn 1
him 1
over 1
to 1
his 1
foster 1
parents 1
as 1
he 1
concluded 1
rokoff 1
held 1
out 1
his 1
hands 1
for 1
the 1
child 1
a 1
nasty 1
grin 1
of 1
vindictiveness 1
upon 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
his 1
surprise 1
jane 1
clayton 1
rose 1
and 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
protest 1
laid 1
the 1
little 1
bundle 1
in 1
his 1
arms 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
child 1
she 1
said 1
thank 1
god 1
he 1
is 1
beyond 1
your 1
power 1
to 1
harm 1
grasping 1
the 1
import 1
of 1
her 1
words 1
rokoff 1
snatched 1
the 1
blanket 1
from 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
face 1
to 1
seek 1
confirmation 1
of 1
his 1
fears 1
jane 1
clayton 1
watched 1
his 1
expression 1
closely 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
puzzled 1
for 1
days 1
for 1
an 1
answer 1
to 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
rokoff 1
s 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
identity 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
doubt 1
before 1
the 1
last 1
shred 1
of 1
that 1
doubt 1
was 1
wiped 1
away 1
as 1
she 1
witnessed 1
the 1
terrible 1
anger 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
dead 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
baby 1
and 1
realized 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
moment 1
his 1
dearest 1
wish 1
for 1
vengeance 1
had 1
been 1
thwarted 1
by 1
a 1
higher 1
power 1
almost 1
throwing 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
back 1
into 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
arms 1
rokoff 1
stamped 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
hut 1
pounding 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
his 1
clenched 1
fists 1
and 1
cursing 1
terribly 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
halted 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
bringing 1
his 1
face 1
down 1
close 1
to 1
hers 1
you 1
are 1
laughing 1
at 1
me 1
he 1
shrieked 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
beaten 1
me 1
eh 1
i 1
ll 1
show 1
you 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
shown 1
the 1
miserable 1
ape 1
you 1
call 1
husband 1
what 1
it 1
means 1
to 1
interfere 1
with 1
the 1
plans 1
of 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
you 1
have 1
robbed 1
me 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
i 1
cannot 1
make 1
him 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
a 1
cannibal 1
chief 1
but 1
and 1
he 1
paused 1
as 1
though 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
full 1
meaning 1
of 1
his 1
threat 1
sink 1
deep 1
i 1
can 1
make 1
the 1
mother 1
the 1
wife 1
of 1
a 1
cannibal 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
do 1
after 1
i 1
have 1
finished 1
with 1
her 1
myself 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
to 1
wring 1
from 1
jane 1
clayton 1
any 1
sign 1
of 1
terror 1
he 1
failed 1
miserably 1
she 1
was 1
beyond 1
that 1
her 1
brain 1
and 1
nerves 1
were 1
numb 1
to 1
suffering 1
and 1
shock 1
to 1
his 1
surprise 1
a 1
faint 1
almost 1
happy 1
smile 1
touched 1
her 1
lips 1
she 1
was 1
thinking 1
with 1
thankful 1
heart 1
that 1
this 1
poor 1
little 1
corpse 1
was 1
not 1
that 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
wee 1
jack 1
and 1
that 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
rokoff 1
evidently 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
truth 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
have 1
flaunted 1
the 1
fact 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
but 1
she 1
dared 1
not 1
if 1
he 1
continued 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
hers 1
so 1
much 1
safer 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
real 1
jack 1
wherever 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
she 1
had 1
of 1
course 1
no 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
even 1
that 1
he 1
still 1
lived 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
chance 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
it 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
possible 1
that 1
without 1
rokoff 1
s 1
knowledge 1
this 1
child 1
had 1
been 1
substituted 1
for 1
hers 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
confederates 1
and 1
that 1
even 1
now 1
her 1
son 1
might 1
be 1
safe 1
with 1
friends 1
in 1
london 1
where 1
there 1
were 1
many 1
both 1
able 1
and 1
willing 1
to 1
have 1
paid 1
any 1
ransom 1
which 1
the 1
traitorous 1
conspirator 1
might 1
have 1
asked 1
for 1
the 1
safe 1
release 1
of 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
s 1
son 1
she 1
had 1
thought 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
discovered 1
that 1
the 1
baby 1
which 1
anderssen 1
had 1
placed 1
in 1
her 1
arms 1
that 1
night 1
upon 1
the 1
kincaid 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
own 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
constant 1
and 1
gnawing 1
source 1
of 1
happiness 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
dream 1
the 1
whole 1
fantasy 1
through 1
in 1
its 1
every 1
detail 1
no 1
the 1
russian 1
must 1
never 1
know 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
not 1
her 1
baby 1
she 1
realized 1
that 1
her 1
position 1
was 1
hopeless 1
with 1
anderssen 1
and 1
her 1
husband 1
dead 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
with 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
succour 1
her 1
who 1
knew 1
where 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
found 1
rokoff 1
s 1
threat 1
she 1
realized 1
was 1
no 1
idle 1
one 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
or 1
attempt 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
promised 1
she 1
was 1
perfectly 1
sure 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
worst 1
it 1
meant 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
earlier 1
release 1
from 1
the 1
hideous 1
anguish 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
enduring 1
she 1
must 1
find 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
own 1
life 1
before 1
the 1
russian 1
could 1
harm 1
her 1
further 1
just 1
now 1
she 1
wanted 1
time 1
time 1
to 1
think 1
and 1
prepare 1
herself 1
for 1
the 1
end 1
she 1
felt 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
the 1
last 1
awful 1
step 1
until 1
she 1
had 1
exhausted 1
every 1
possibility 1
of 1
escape 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
to 1
live 1
unless 1
she 1
might 1
find 1
her 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
own 1
child 1
but 1
slight 1
as 1
such 1
a 1
hope 1
appeared 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
admit 1
its 1
impossibility 1
until 1
the 1
last 1
moment 1
had 1
come 1
and 1
she 1
faced 1
the 1
fearful 1
reality 1
of 1
choosing 1
between 1
the 1
final 1
alternatives 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
on 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
self 1
destruction 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
go 1
away 1
she 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
russian 1
go 1
away 1
and 1
leave 1
me 1
in 1
peace 1
with 1
my 1
dead 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
brought 1
sufficient 1
misery 1
and 1
anguish 1
upon 1
me 1
without 1
attempting 1
to 1
harm 1
me 1
further 1
what 1
wrong 1
have 1
i 1
ever 1
done 1
you 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
persist 1
in 1
persecuting 1
me 1
you 1
are 1
suffering 1
for 1
the 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
monkey 1
you 1
chose 1
when 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
a 1
gentleman 1
of 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
he 1
replied 1
but 1
where 1
is 1
the 1
use 1
in 1
discussing 1
the 1
matter 1
we 1
shall 1
bury 1
the 1
child 1
here 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
return 1
with 1
me 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
camp 1
tomorrow 1
i 1
shall 1
bring 1
you 1
back 1
and 1
turn 1
you 1
over 1
to 1
your 1
new 1
husband 1
the 1
lovely 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
come 1
he 1
reached 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
child 1
jane 1
who 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
feet 1
now 1
turned 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
i 1
shall 1
bury 1
the 1
body 1
she 1
said 1
send 1
some 1
men 1
to 1
dig 1
a 1
grave 1
outside 1
the 1
village 1
rokoff 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
thing 1
over 1
and 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
camp 1
with 1
his 1
victim 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
saw 1
in 1
her 1
apathy 1
a 1
resignation 1
to 1
her 1
fate 1
stepping 1
outside 1
the 1
hut 1
he 1
motioned 1
her 1
to 1
follow 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
with 1
his 1
men 1
he 1
escorted 1
jane 1
beyond 1
the 1
village 1
where 1
beneath 1
a 1
great 1
tree 1
the 1
blacks 1
scooped 1
a 1
shallow 1
grave 1
wrapping 1
the 1
tiny 1
body 1
in 1
a 1
blanket 1
jane 1
laid 1
it 1
tenderly 1
in 1
the 1
black 1
hole 1
and 1
turning 1
her 1
head 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
not 1
see 1
the 1
mouldy 1
earth 1
falling 1
upon 1
the 1
pitiful 1
little 1
bundle 1
she 1
breathed 1
a 1
prayer 1
beside 1
the 1
grave 1
of 1
the 1
nameless 1
waif 1
that 1
had 1
won 1
its 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
innermost 1
recesses 1
of 1
her 1
heart 1
then 1
dry 1
eyed 1
but 1
suffering 1
she 1
rose 1
and 1
followed 1
the 1
russian 1
through 1
the 1
stygian 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
along 1
the 1
winding 1
leafy 1
corridor 1
that 1
led 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
the 1
black 1
cannibal 1
to 1
the 1
camp 1
of 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
the 1
white 1
fiend 1
beside 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
impenetrable 1
thickets 1
that 1
fringed 1
the 1
path 1
rising 1
to 1
arch 1
above 1
it 1
and 1
shut 1
out 1
the 1
moon 1
the 1
girl 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
stealthy 1
muffled 1
footfalls 1
of 1
great 1
beasts 1
and 1
ever 1
round 1
about 1
them 1
rose 1
the 1
deafening 1
roars 1
of 1
hunting 1
lions 1
until 1
the 1
earth 1
trembled 1
to 1
the 1
mighty 1
sound 1
the 1
porters 1
lighted 1
torches 1
now 1
and 1
waved 1
them 1
upon 1
either 1
hand 1
to 1
frighten 1
off 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
prey 1
rokoff 1
urged 1
them 1
to 1
greater 1
speed 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
quavering 1
note 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
jane 1
clayton 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
weak 1
from 1
terror 1
the 1
sounds 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
night 1
recalled 1
most 1
vividly 1
the 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
spent 1
in 1
a 1
similar 1
jungle 1
with 1
her 1
forest 1
god 1
with 1
the 1
fearless 1
and 1
unconquerable 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
then 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
no 1
thoughts 1
of 1
terror 1
though 1
the 1
jungle 1
noises 1
were 1
new 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
the 1
roar 1
of 1
a 1
lion 1
had 1
seemed 1
the 1
most 1
awe 1
inspiring 1
sound 1
upon 1
the 1
great 1
earth 1
how 1
different 1
would 1
it 1
be 1
now 1
if 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
somewhere 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
wilderness 1
seeking 1
her 1
then 1
indeed 1
would 1
there 1
be 1
that 1
for 1
which 1
to 1
live 1
and 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
succour 1
was 1
close 1
at 1
hand 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
it 1
was 1
incredible 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
there 1
seemed 1
no 1
place 1
in 1
death 1
for 1
that 1
great 1
body 1
and 1
those 1
mighty 1
thews 1
had 1
rokoff 1
been 1
the 1
one 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
of 1
her 1
lord 1
s 1
passing 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
known 1
that 1
he 1
lied 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
reason 1
she 1
thought 1
why 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
should 1
have 1
deceived 1
her 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
russian 1
had 1
talked 1
with 1
the 1
savage 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
before 1
the 1
chief 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
her 1
with 1
his 1
tale 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
rude 1
boma 1
that 1
rokoff 1
s 1
porters 1
had 1
thrown 1
up 1
round 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
camp 1
here 1
they 1
found 1
all 1
in 1
turmoil 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
about 1
but 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
rokoff 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
and 1
from 1
bits 1
of 1
conversation 1
which 1
she 1
could 1
translate 1
she 1
gleaned 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
further 1
desertions 1
while 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
absent 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
deserters 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
bulk 1
of 1
his 1
food 1
and 1
ammunition 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
venting 1
his 1
rage 1
upon 1
those 1
who 1
remained 1
he 1
returned 1
to 1
where 1
jane 1
stood 1
under 1
guard 1
of 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
his 1
white 1
sailors 1
he 1
grasped 1
her 1
roughly 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
and 1
started 1
to 1
drag 1
her 1
toward 1
his 1
tent 1
the 1
girl 1
struggled 1
and 1
fought 1
to 1
free 1
herself 1
while 1
the 1
two 1
sailors 1
stood 1
by 1
laughing 1
at 1
the 1
rare 1
treat 1
rokoff 1
did 1
not 1
hesitate 1
to 1
use 1
rough 1
methods 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
have 1
difficulty 1
in 1
carrying 1
out 1
his 1
designs 1
repeatedly 1
he 1
struck 1
jane 1
clayton 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
half 1
conscious 1
she 1
was 1
dragged 1
within 1
his 1
tent 1
rokoff 1
s 1
boy 1
had 1
lighted 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
lamp 1
and 1
now 1
at 1
a 1
word 1
from 1
his 1
master 1
he 1
made 1
himself 1
scarce 1
jane 1
had 1
sunk 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
enclosure 1
slowly 1
her 1
numbed 1
senses 1
were 1
returning 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
commencing 1
to 1
think 1
very 1
fast 1
indeed 1
quickly 1
her 1
eyes 1
ran 1
round 1
the 1
interior 1
of 1
the 1
tent 1
taking 1
in 1
every 1
detail 1
of 1
its 1
equipment 1
and 1
contents 1
now 1
the 1
russian 1
was 1
lifting 1
her 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
attempting 1
to 1
drag 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
camp 1
cot 1
that 1
stood 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
tent 1
at 1
his 1
belt 1
hung 1
a 1
heavy 1
revolver 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
eyes 1
riveted 1
themselves 1
upon 1
it 1
her 1
palm 1
itched 1
to 1
grasp 1
the 1
huge 1
butt 1
she 1
feigned 1
again 1
to 1
swoon 1
but 1
through 1
her 1
half 1
closed 1
lids 1
she 1
waited 1
her 1
opportunity 1
it 1
came 1
just 1
as 1
rokoff 1
was 1
lifting 1
her 1
upon 1
the 1
cot 1
a 1
noise 1
at 1
the 1
tent 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
brought 1
his 1
head 1
quickly 1
about 1
and 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
girl 1
the 1
butt 1
of 1
the 1
gun 1
was 1
not 1
an 1
inch 1
from 1
her 1
hand 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
lightning 1
like 1
move 1
she 1
snatched 1
the 1
weapon 1
from 1
its 1
holster 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
rokoff 1
turned 1
back 1
toward 1
her 1
realizing 1
his 1
peril 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
dare 1
fire 1
for 1
fear 1
the 1
shot 1
would 1
bring 1
his 1
people 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
with 1
rokoff 1
dead 1
she 1
would 1
fall 1
into 1
hands 1
no 1
better 1
than 1
his 1
and 1
to 1
a 1
fate 1
probably 1
even 1
worse 1
than 1
he 1
alone 1
could 1
have 1
imagined 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
brutes 1
who 1
stood 1
and 1
laughed 1
as 1
rokoff 1
struck 1
her 1
was 1
still 1
vivid 1
as 1
the 1
rage 1
and 1
fear 1
filled 1
countenance 1
of 1
the 1
slav 1
turned 1
toward 1
her 1
jane 1
clayton 1
raised 1
the 1
heavy 1
revolver 1
high 1
above 1
the 1
pasty 1
face 1
and 1
with 1
all 1
her 1
strength 1
dealt 1
the 1
man 1
a 1
terrific 1
blow 1
between 1
the 1
eyes 1
without 1
a 1
sound 1
he 1
sank 1
limp 1
and 1
unconscious 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
girl 1
stood 1
beside 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
at 1
least 1
free 1
from 1
the 1
menace 1
of 1
his 1
lust 1
outside 1
the 1
tent 1
she 1
again 1
heard 1
the 1
noise 1
that 1
had 1
distracted 1
rokoff 1
s 1
attention 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
but 1
fearing 1
the 1
return 1
of 1
the 1
servant 1
and 1
the 1
discovery 1
of 1
her 1
deed 1
she 1
stepped 1
quickly 1
to 1
the 1
camp 1
table 1
upon 1
which 1
burned 1
the 1
oil 1
lamp 1
and 1
extinguished 1
the 1
smudgy 1
evil 1
smelling 1
flame 1
in 1
the 1
total 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
interior 1
she 1
paused 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
collect 1
her 1
wits 1
and 1
plan 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
step 1
in 1
her 1
venture 1
for 1
freedom 1
about 1
her 1
was 1
a 1
camp 1
of 1
enemies 1
beyond 1
these 1
foes 1
a 1
black 1
wilderness 1
of 1
savage 1
jungle 1
peopled 1
by 1
hideous 1
beasts 1
of 1
prey 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
hideous 1
human 1
beasts 1
there 1
was 1
little 1
or 1
no 1
chance 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
survive 1
even 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
constant 1
dangers 1
that 1
would 1
confront 1
her 1
there 1
but 1
the 1
knowledge 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
already 1
passed 1
through 1
so 1
many 1
perils 1
unscathed 1
and 1
that 1
somewhere 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
faraway 1
world 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
was 1
doubtless 1
at 1
that 1
very 1
moment 1
crying 1
for 1
her 1
filled 1
her 1
with 1
determination 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
effort 1
to 1
accomplish 1
the 1
seemingly 1
impossible 1
and 1
cross 1
that 1
awful 1
land 1
of 1
horror 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
the 1
remote 1
chance 1
of 1
succour 1
she 1
might 1
find 1
there 1
rokoff 1
s 1
tent 1
stood 1
almost 1
exactly 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
boma 1
surrounding 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
tents 1
and 1
shelters 1
of 1
his 1
white 1
companions 1
and 1
the 1
natives 1
of 1
his 1
safari 1
to 1
pass 1
through 1
these 1
and 1
find 1
egress 1
through 1
the 1
boma 1
seemed 1
a 1
task 1
too 1
fraught 1
with 1
insurmountable 1
obstacles 1
to 1
warrant 1
even 1
the 1
slightest 1
consideration 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
tent 1
until 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
discovered 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
set 1
at 1
naught 1
all 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
risked 1
to 1
gain 1
her 1
freedom 1
and 1
so 1
with 1
stealthy 1
step 1
and 1
every 1
sense 1
alert 1
she 1
approached 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
tent 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
first 1
stage 1
of 1
her 1
adventure 1
groping 1
along 1
the 1
rear 1
of 1
the 1
canvas 1
wall 1
she 1
found 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
opening 1
there 1
quickly 1
she 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
unconscious 1
russian 1
in 1
his 1
belt 1
her 1
groping 1
fingers 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
hilt 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
hunting 1
knife 1
and 1
with 1
this 1
she 1
cut 1
a 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
wall 1
of 1
the 1
tent 1
silently 1
she 1
stepped 1
without 1
to 1
her 1
immense 1
relief 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
camp 1
was 1
apparently 1
asleep 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
and 1
flickering 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
fires 1
she 1
saw 1
but 1
a 1
single 1
sentry 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
dozing 1
upon 1
his 1
haunches 1
at 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
enclosure 1
keeping 1
the 1
tent 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
herself 1
she 1
crossed 1
between 1
the 1
small 1
shelters 1
of 1
the 1
native 1
porters 1
to 1
the 1
boma 1
wall 1
beyond 1
outside 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
tangled 1
jungle 1
she 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
roaring 1
of 1
lions 1
the 1
laughing 1
of 1
hyenas 1
and 1
the 1
countless 1
nameless 1
noises 1
of 1
the 1
midnight 1
jungle 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
she 1
hesitated 1
trembling 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
prowling 1
beasts 1
out 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
was 1
appalling 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
brave 1
toss 1
of 1
her 1
head 1
she 1
attacked 1
the 1
thorny 1
boma 1
wall 1
with 1
her 1
delicate 1
hands 1
torn 1
and 1
bleeding 1
though 1
they 1
were 1
she 1
worked 1
on 1
breathlessly 1
until 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
an 1
opening 1
through 1
which 1
she 1
could 1
worm 1
her 1
body 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
stood 1
outside 1
the 1
enclosure 1
behind 1
her 1
lay 1
a 1
fate 1
worse 1
than 1
death 1
at 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
human 1
beings 1
before 1
her 1
lay 1
an 1
almost 1
certain 1
fate 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
death 1
sudden 1
merciful 1
and 1
honourable 1
death 1
without 1
a 1
tremor 1
and 1
without 1
regret 1
she 1
darted 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
camp 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
mysterious 1
jungle 1
had 1
closed 1
about 1
her 1
chapter 1
14 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
tambudza 1
leading 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
toward 1
the 1
camp 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
moved 1
very 1
slowly 1
along 1
the 1
winding 1
jungle 1
path 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
old 1
and 1
her 1
legs 1
stiff 1
with 1
rheumatism 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
runners 1
dispatched 1
by 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
to 1
warn 1
rokoff 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
giant 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
village 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
slain 1
that 1
night 1
reached 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
camp 1
before 1
tarzan 1
and 1
his 1
ancient 1
guide 1
had 1
covered 1
half 1
the 1
distance 1
the 1
guides 1
found 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
s 1
camp 1
in 1
a 1
turmoil 1
rokoff 1
had 1
that 1
morning 1
been 1
discovered 1
stunned 1
and 1
bleeding 1
within 1
his 1
tent 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
recovered 1
his 1
senses 1
and 1
realized 1
that 1
jane 1
clayton 1
had 1
escaped 1
his 1
rage 1
was 1
boundless 1
rushing 1
about 1
the 1
camp 1
with 1
his 1
rifle 1
he 1
had 1
sought 1
to 1
shoot 1
down 1
the 1
native 1
sentries 1
who 1
had 1
allowed 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
to 1
elude 1
their 1
vigilance 1
but 1
several 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
whites 1
realizing 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
already 1
in 1
a 1
precarious 1
position 1
owing 1
to 1
the 1
numerous 1
desertions 1
that 1
rokoff 1
s 1
cruelty 1
had 1
brought 1
about 1
seized 1
and 1
disarmed 1
him 1
then 1
came 1
the 1
messengers 1
from 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
but 1
scarce 1
had 1
they 1
told 1
their 1
story 1
and 1
rokoff 1
was 1
preparing 1
to 1
depart 1
with 1
them 1
for 1
their 1
village 1
when 1
other 1
runners 1
panting 1
from 1
the 1
exertions 1
of 1
their 1
swift 1
flight 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
rushed 1
breathless 1
into 1
the 1
firelight 1
crying 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
white 1
giant 1
had 1
escaped 1
from 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
and 1
was 1
already 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
wreak 1
vengeance 1
against 1
his 1
enemies 1
instantly 1
confusion 1
reigned 1
within 1
the 1
encircling 1
boma 1
the 1
blacks 1
belonging 1
to 1
rokoff 1
s 1
safari 1
were 1
terror 1
stricken 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
proximity 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
giant 1
who 1
hunted 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
with 1
a 1
fierce 1
pack 1
of 1
apes 1
and 1
panthers 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
before 1
the 1
whites 1
realized 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
the 1
superstitious 1
fears 1
of 1
the 1
natives 1
had 1
sent 1
them 1
scurrying 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
their 1
own 1
carriers 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
messengers 1
from 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
but 1
even 1
in 1
their 1
haste 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
neglected 1
to 1
take 1
with 1
them 1
every 1
article 1
of 1
value 1
upon 1
which 1
they 1
could 1
lay 1
their 1
hands 1
thus 1
rokoff 1
and 1
the 1
seven 1
white 1
sailors 1
found 1
themselves 1
deserted 1
and 1
robbed 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
wilderness 1
the 1
russian 1
following 1
his 1
usual 1
custom 1
berated 1
his 1
companions 1
laying 1
all 1
the 1
blame 1
upon 1
their 1
shoulders 1
for 1
the 1
events 1
which 1
had 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
almost 1
hopeless 1
condition 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
now 1
found 1
themselves 1
but 1
the 1
sailors 1
were 1
in 1
no 1
mood 1
to 1
brook 1
his 1
insults 1
and 1
his 1
cursing 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
this 1
tirade 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
drew 1
a 1
revolver 1
and 1
fired 1
point 1
blank 1
at 1
the 1
russian 1
the 1
fellow 1
s 1
aim 1
was 1
poor 1
but 1
his 1
act 1
so 1
terrified 1
rokoff 1
that 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
fled 1
for 1
his 1
tent 1
as 1
he 1
ran 1
his 1
eyes 1
chanced 1
to 1
pass 1
beyond 1
the 1
boma 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
that 1
which 1
sent 1
his 1
craven 1
heart 1
cold 1
with 1
a 1
fear 1
that 1
almost 1
expunged 1
his 1
terror 1
of 1
the 1
seven 1
men 1
at 1
his 1
back 1
who 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
were 1
all 1
firing 1
in 1
hate 1
and 1
revenge 1
at 1
his 1
retreating 1
figure 1
what 1
he 1
saw 1
was 1
the 1
giant 1
figure 1
of 1
an 1
almost 1
naked 1
white 1
man 1
emerging 1
from 1
the 1
bush 1
darting 1
into 1
his 1
tent 1
the 1
russian 1
did 1
not 1
halt 1
in 1
his 1
flight 1
but 1
kept 1
right 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
rear 1
wall 1
taking 1
advantage 1
of 1
the 1
long 1
slit 1
that 1
jane 1
clayton 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
the 1
terror 1
stricken 1
muscovite 1
scurried 1
like 1
a 1
hunted 1
rabbit 1
through 1
the 1
hole 1
that 1
still 1
gaped 1
in 1
the 1
boma 1
s 1
wall 1
at 1
the 1
point 1
where 1
his 1
own 1
prey 1
had 1
escaped 1
and 1
as 1
tarzan 1
approached 1
the 1
camp 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
rokoff 1
disappeared 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
in 1
the 1
wake 1
of 1
jane 1
clayton 1
as 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
entered 1
the 1
boma 1
with 1
old 1
tambudza 1
at 1
his 1
elbow 1
the 1
seven 1
sailors 1
recognizing 1
him 1
turned 1
and 1
fled 1
in 1
the 1
opposite 1
direction 1
tarzan 1
saw 1
that 1
rokoff 1
was 1
not 1
among 1
them 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
their 1
way 1
his 1
business 1
was 1
with 1
the 1
russian 1
whom 1
he 1
expected 1
to 1
find 1
in 1
his 1
tent 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
sailors 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
jungle 1
would 1
exact 1
from 1
them 1
expiation 1
for 1
their 1
villainies 1
nor 1
doubtless 1
was 1
he 1
wrong 1
for 1
his 1
were 1
the 1
last 1
white 1
man 1
s 1
eyes 1
to 1
rest 1
upon 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
finding 1
rokoff 1
s 1
tent 1
empty 1
tarzan 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
when 1
tambudza 1
suggested 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
departure 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
resulted 1
from 1
word 1
reaching 1
him 1
from 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
that 1
tarzan 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
village 1
he 1
has 1
doubtless 1
hastened 1
there 1
argued 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
find 1
him 1
let 1
us 1
return 1
at 1
once 1
tarzan 1
himself 1
thought 1
that 1
this 1
would 1
probably 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
fact 1
so 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
waste 1
time 1
in 1
an 1
endeavour 1
to 1
locate 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
trail 1
but 1
instead 1
set 1
out 1
briskly 1
for 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
leaving 1
tambudza 1
to 1
plod 1
slowly 1
in 1
his 1
wake 1
his 1
one 1
hope 1
was 1
that 1
jane 1
was 1
still 1
safe 1
and 1
with 1
rokoff 1
if 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
case 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
but 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
more 1
before 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
wrest 1
her 1
from 1
the 1
russian 1
he 1
knew 1
now 1
that 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
was 1
treacherous 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
to 1
fight 1
to 1
regain 1
possession 1
of 1
his 1
wife 1
he 1
wished 1
that 1
mugambi 1
sheeta 1
akut 1
and 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
were 1
with 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
realized 1
that 1
single 1
handed 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
child 1
s 1
play 1
to 1
bring 1
jane 1
safely 1
from 1
the 1
clutches 1
of 1
two 1
such 1
scoundrels 1
as 1
rokoff 1
and 1
the 1
wily 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
to 1
his 1
surprise 1
he 1
found 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
either 1
rokoff 1
or 1
jane 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
trust 1
the 1
word 1
of 1
the 1
chief 1
he 1
wasted 1
no 1
time 1
in 1
futile 1
inquiry 1
so 1
sudden 1
and 1
unexpected 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
return 1
and 1
so 1
quickly 1
had 1
he 1
vanished 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
after 1
learning 1
that 1
those 1
he 1
sought 1
were 1
not 1
among 1
the 1
waganwazam 1
that 1
old 1
m 1
ganwazam 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
prevent 1
his 1
going 1
swinging 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
he 1
hastened 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
deserted 1
camp 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
recently 1
left 1
for 1
here 1
he 1
knew 1
was 1
the 1
logical 1
place 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
the 1
trail 1
of 1
rokoff 1
and 1
jane 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
boma 1
he 1
circled 1
carefully 1
about 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
enclosure 1
until 1
opposite 1
a 1
break 1
in 1
the 1
thorny 1
wall 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
indications 1
that 1
something 1
had 1
recently 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
his 1
acute 1
sense 1
of 1
smell 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
both 1
of 1
those 1
he 1
sought 1
had 1
fled 1
from 1
the 1
camp 1
in 1
this 1
direction 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
up 1
the 1
trail 1
and 1
was 1
following 1
the 1
faint 1
spoor 1
far 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
a 1
terror 1
stricken 1
young 1
woman 1
was 1
slinking 1
along 1
a 1
narrow 1
game 1
trail 1
fearful 1
that 1
the 1
next 1
moment 1
would 1
bring 1
her 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
with 1
some 1
savage 1
beast 1
or 1
equally 1
savage 1
man 1
as 1
she 1
ran 1
on 1
hoping 1
against 1
hope 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
hit 1
upon 1
the 1
direction 1
that 1
would 1
lead 1
her 1
eventually 1
to 1
the 1
great 1
river 1
she 1
came 1
suddenly 1
upon 1
a 1
familiar 1
spot 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
trail 1
beneath 1
a 1
giant 1
tree 1
lay 1
a 1
little 1
heap 1
of 1
loosely 1
piled 1
brush 1
to 1
her 1
dying 1
day 1
that 1
little 1
spot 1
of 1
jungle 1
would 1
be 1
indelibly 1
impressed 1
upon 1
her 1
memory 1
it 1
was 1
where 1
anderssen 1
had 1
hidden 1
her 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
the 1
vain 1
effort 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
from 1
rokoff 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
it 1
she 1
recalled 1
the 1
rifle 1
and 1
ammunition 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
had 1
thrust 1
upon 1
her 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
moment 1
until 1
now 1
she 1
had 1
forgotten 1
them 1
entirely 1
still 1
clutched 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
was 1
the 1
revolver 1
she 1
had 1
snatched 1
from 1
rokoff 1
s 1
belt 1
but 1
that 1
could 1
contain 1
at 1
most 1
not 1
over 1
six 1
cartridges 1
not 1
enough 1
to 1
furnish 1
her 1
with 1
food 1
and 1
protection 1
both 1
on 1
the 1
long 1
journey 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
with 1
bated 1
breath 1
she 1
groped 1
beneath 1
the 1
little 1
mound 1
scarce 1
daring 1
to 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
treasure 1
remained 1
where 1
she 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
but 1
to 1
her 1
infinite 1
relief 1
and 1
joy 1
her 1
hand 1
came 1
at 1
once 1
upon 1
the 1
barrel 1
of 1
the 1
heavy 1
weapon 1
and 1
then 1
upon 1
the 1
bandoleer 1
of 1
cartridges 1
as 1
she 1
threw 1
the 1
latter 1
about 1
her 1
shoulder 1
and 1
felt 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
the 1
big 1
game 1
gun 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
a 1
sudden 1
sense 1
of 1
security 1
suffused 1
her 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
new 1
hope 1
and 1
a 1
feeling 1
almost 1
of 1
assured 1
success 1
that 1
she 1
again 1
set 1
forward 1
upon 1
her 1
journey 1
that 1
night 1
she 1
slept 1
in 1
the 1
crotch 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
as 1
tarzan 1
had 1
so 1
often 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
accustomed 1
to 1
doing 1
and 1
early 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
was 1
upon 1
her 1
way 1
again 1
late 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
cross 1
a 1
little 1
clearing 1
she 1
was 1
startled 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
huge 1
ape 1
coming 1
from 1
the 1
jungle 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
the 1
wind 1
was 1
blowing 1
directly 1
across 1
the 1
clearing 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
jane 1
lost 1
no 1
time 1
in 1
putting 1
herself 1
downwind 1
from 1
the 1
huge 1
creature 1
then 1
she 1
hid 1
in 1
a 1
clump 1
of 1
heavy 1
bush 1
and 1
watched 1
holding 1
the 1
rifle 1
ready 1
for 1
instant 1
use 1
to 1
her 1
consternation 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
apes 1
were 1
pausing 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
clearing 1
they 1
came 1
together 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
knot 1
where 1
they 1
stood 1
looking 1
backward 1
as 1
though 1
in 1
expectation 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
others 1
of 1
their 1
tribe 1
jane 1
wished 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
go 1
on 1
for 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
some 1
little 1
eddying 1
gust 1
of 1
wind 1
might 1
carry 1
her 1
scent 1
down 1
to 1
their 1
nostrils 1
and 1
then 1
what 1
would 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
her 1
rifle 1
amount 1
to 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
those 1
gigantic 1
muscles 1
and 1
mighty 1
fangs 1
her 1
eyes 1
moved 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
between 1
the 1
apes 1
and 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
toward 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
gazing 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
perceived 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
their 1
halt 1
and 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
they 1
awaited 1
they 1
were 1
being 1
stalked 1
of 1
this 1
she 1
was 1
positive 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
lithe 1
sinewy 1
form 1
of 1
a 1
panther 1
glide 1
noiselessly 1
from 1
the 1
jungle 1
at 1
the 1
point 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
apes 1
had 1
emerged 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
before 1
quickly 1
the 1
beast 1
trotted 1
across 1
the 1
clearing 1
toward 1
the 1
anthropoids 1
jane 1
wondered 1
at 1
their 1
apparent 1
apathy 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
her 1
wonder 1
turned 1
to 1
amazement 1
as 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
great 1
cat 1
come 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
apes 1
who 1
appeared 1
entirely 1
unconcerned 1
by 1
its 1
presence 1
and 1
squatting 1
down 1
in 1
their 1
midst 1
fell 1
assiduously 1
to 1
the 1
business 1
of 1
preening 1
which 1
occupies 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
waking 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
cat 1
family 1
if 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
was 1
surprised 1
by 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
these 1
natural 1
enemies 1
fraternizing 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
emotions 1
little 1
short 1
of 1
fear 1
for 1
her 1
own 1
sanity 1
that 1
she 1
presently 1
saw 1
a 1
tall 1
muscular 1
warrior 1
enter 1
the 1
clearing 1
and 1
join 1
the 1
group 1
of 1
savage 1
beasts 1
assembled 1
there 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
positive 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
torn 1
to 1
pieces 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
half 1
risen 1
from 1
her 1
shelter 1
raising 1
her 1
rifle 1
to 1
her 1
shoulder 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
she 1
could 1
to 1
avert 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
terrible 1
fate 1
now 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
seemed 1
actually 1
conversing 1
with 1
the 1
beasts 1
issuing 1
orders 1
to 1
them 1
presently 1
the 1
entire 1
company 1
filed 1
on 1
across 1
the 1
clearing 1
and 1
disappeared 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
with 1
a 1
gasp 1
of 1
mingled 1
incredulity 1
and 1
relief 1
jane 1
clayton 1
staggered 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
fled 1
on 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
terrible 1
horde 1
that 1
had 1
just 1
passed 1
her 1
while 1
a 1
half 1
mile 1
behind 1
her 1
another 1
individual 1
following 1
the 1
same 1
trail 1
as 1
she 1
lay 1
frozen 1
with 1
terror 1
behind 1
an 1
ant 1
hill 1
as 1
the 1
hideous 1
band 1
passed 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
him 1
this 1
one 1
was 1
rokoff 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
recognized 1
the 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
awful 1
aggregation 1
as 1
allies 1
of 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
no 1
sooner 1
therefore 1
had 1
the 1
beasts 1
passed 1
him 1
than 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
raced 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
put 1
as 1
much 1
distance 1
as 1
possible 1
between 1
himself 1
and 1
these 1
frightful 1
beasts 1
so 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
as 1
jane 1
clayton 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
down 1
which 1
she 1
hoped 1
to 1
float 1
to 1
the 1
ocean 1
and 1
eventual 1
rescue 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
in 1
her 1
rear 1
upon 1
the 1
bank 1
the 1
girl 1
saw 1
a 1
great 1
dugout 1
drawn 1
half 1
way 1
from 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
tied 1
securely 1
to 1
a 1
near 1
by 1
tree 1
this 1
she 1
felt 1
would 1
solve 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
transportation 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
could 1
she 1
but 1
launch 1
the 1
huge 1
unwieldy 1
craft 1
unfastening 1
the 1
rope 1
that 1
had 1
moored 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
jane 1
pushed 1
frantically 1
upon 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
heavy 1
canoe 1
but 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
results 1
that 1
were 1
apparent 1
she 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
have 1
been 1
attempting 1
to 1
shove 1
the 1
earth 1
out 1
of 1
its 1
orbit 1
she 1
was 1
about 1
winded 1
when 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
try 1
working 1
the 1
dugout 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
by 1
loading 1
the 1
stern 1
with 1
ballast 1
and 1
then 1
rocking 1
the 1
bow 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
along 1
the 1
bank 1
until 1
the 1
craft 1
eventually 1
worked 1
itself 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
stones 1
or 1
rocks 1
available 1
but 1
along 1
the 1
shore 1
she 1
found 1
quantities 1
of 1
driftwood 1
deposited 1
by 1
the 1
river 1
at 1
a 1
slightly 1
higher 1
stage 1
these 1
she 1
gathered 1
and 1
piled 1
far 1
in 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
her 1
immense 1
relief 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
bow 1
rise 1
gently 1
from 1
the 1
mud 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
the 1
stern 1
drift 1
slowly 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
until 1
it 1
again 1
lodged 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
farther 1
down 1
stream 1
jane 1
found 1
that 1
by 1
running 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
between 1
the 1
bow 1
and 1
stern 1
she 1
could 1
alternately 1
raise 1
and 1
lower 1
each 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
as 1
she 1
shifted 1
her 1
weight 1
from 1
one 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
with 1
the 1
result 1
that 1
each 1
time 1
she 1
leaped 1
to 1
the 1
stern 1
the 1
canoe 1
moved 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
farther 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
as 1
the 1
success 1
of 1
her 1
plan 1
approached 1
more 1
closely 1
to 1
fruition 1
she 1
became 1
so 1
wrapped 1
in 1
her 1
efforts 1
that 1
she 1
failed 1
to 1
note 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
standing 1
beneath 1
a 1
huge 1
tree 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
emerged 1
he 1
watched 1
her 1
and 1
her 1
labours 1
with 1
a 1
cruel 1
and 1
malicious 1
grin 1
upon 1
his 1
swarthy 1
countenance 1
the 1
boat 1
at 1
last 1
became 1
so 1
nearly 1
free 1
of 1
the 1
retarding 1
mud 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
bank 1
that 1
jane 1
felt 1
positive 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
pole 1
it 1
off 1
into 1
deeper 1
water 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
paddles 1
which 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
rude 1
craft 1
with 1
this 1
end 1
in 1
view 1
she 1
seized 1
upon 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
implements 1
and 1
had 1
just 1
plunged 1
it 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
bottom 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
when 1
her 1
eyes 1
happened 1
to 1
rise 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
as 1
her 1
gaze 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
terror 1
rose 1
to 1
her 1
lips 1
it 1
was 1
rokoff 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
toward 1
her 1
now 1
and 1
shouting 1
to 1
her 1
to 1
wait 1
or 1
he 1
would 1
shoot 1
though 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
entirely 1
unarmed 1
it 1
was 1
difficult 1
to 1
discover 1
just 1
how 1
he 1
intended 1
making 1
good 1
his 1
threat 1
jane 1
clayton 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
misfortunes 1
that 1
had 1
befallen 1
the 1
russian 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
escaped 1
from 1
his 1
tent 1
so 1
she 1
believed 1
that 1
his 1
followers 1
must 1
be 1
close 1
at 1
hand 1
however 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
intention 1
of 1
falling 1
again 1
into 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
clutches 1
she 1
would 1
rather 1
die 1
at 1
once 1
than 1
that 1
that 1
should 1
happen 1
to 1
her 1
another 1
minute 1
and 1
the 1
boat 1
would 1
be 1
free 1
once 1
in 1
the 1
current 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
beyond 1
rokoff 1
s 1
power 1
to 1
stop 1
her 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
boat 1
upon 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
no 1
man 1
and 1
certainly 1
not 1
the 1
cowardly 1
rokoff 1
would 1
dare 1
to 1
attempt 1
to 1
swim 1
the 1
crocodile 1
infested 1
water 1
in 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
overtake 1
her 1
rokoff 1
on 1
his 1
part 1
was 1
bent 1
more 1
upon 1
escape 1
than 1
aught 1
else 1
he 1
would 1
gladly 1
have 1
forgone 1
any 1
designs 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
had 1
upon 1
jane 1
clayton 1
would 1
she 1
but 1
permit 1
him 1
to 1
share 1
this 1
means 1
of 1
escape 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
discovered 1
he 1
would 1
promise 1
anything 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
let 1
him 1
come 1
aboard 1
the 1
dugout 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
easily 1
reach 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
before 1
it 1
cleared 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
then 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
necessary 1
to 1
make 1
promises 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
not 1
that 1
rokoff 1
would 1
have 1
felt 1
the 1
slightest 1
compunction 1
in 1
ignoring 1
any 1
promises 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
made 1
the 1
girl 1
but 1
he 1
disliked 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
having 1
to 1
sue 1
for 1
favour 1
with 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
so 1
recently 1
assaulted 1
and 1
escaped 1
him 1
already 1
he 1
was 1
gloating 1
over 1
the 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
of 1
revenge 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
his 1
while 1
the 1
heavy 1
dugout 1
drifted 1
its 1
slow 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
ocean 1
jane 1
clayton 1
working 1
furiously 1
to 1
shove 1
the 1
boat 1
beyond 1
his 1
reach 1
suddenly 1
realized 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
successful 1
for 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
lurch 1
the 1
dugout 1
swung 1
quickly 1
into 1
the 1
current 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
russian 1
reached 1
out 1
to 1
place 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
its 1
bow 1
his 1
fingers 1
did 1
not 1
miss 1
their 1
goal 1
by 1
a 1
half 1
dozen 1
inches 1
the 1
girl 1
almost 1
collapsed 1
with 1
the 1
reaction 1
from 1
the 1
terrific 1
mental 1
physical 1
and 1
nervous 1
strain 1
under 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
labouring 1
for 1
the 1
past 1
few 1
minutes 1
but 1
thank 1
heaven 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
was 1
safe 1
even 1
as 1
she 1
breathed 1
a 1
silent 1
prayer 1
of 1
thanksgiving 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
sudden 1
expression 1
of 1
triumph 1
lighten 1
the 1
features 1
of 1
the 1
cursing 1
russian 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
he 1
dropped 1
suddenly 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
grasping 1
firmly 1
upon 1
something 1
which 1
wriggled 1
through 1
the 1
mud 1
toward 1
the 1
water 1
jane 1
clayton 1
crouched 1
wide 1
eyed 1
and 1
horror 1
stricken 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
as 1
she 1
realized 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
instant 1
success 1
had 1
been 1
turned 1
to 1
failure 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
indeed 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
the 1
malignant 1
rokoff 1
for 1
the 1
thing 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
had 1
seen 1
and 1
grasped 1
was 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
trailing 1
rope 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
dugout 1
had 1
been 1
moored 1
to 1
the 1
tree 1
chapter 1
15 1
down 1
the 1
ugambi 1
halfway 1
between 1
the 1
ugambi 1
and 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
the 1
waganwazam 1
tarzan 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
pack 1
moving 1
slowly 1
along 1
his 1
old 1
spoor 1
mugambi 1
could 1
scarce 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
trail 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
and 1
the 1
mate 1
of 1
his 1
savage 1
master 1
had 1
passed 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
it 1
seemed 1
incredible 1
that 1
two 1
human 1
beings 1
should 1
have 1
come 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
them 1
without 1
having 1
been 1
detected 1
by 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
marvellously 1
keen 1
and 1
alert 1
beasts 1
but 1
tarzan 1
pointed 1
out 1
the 1
spoor 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
he 1
trailed 1
and 1
at 1
certain 1
points 1
the 1
black 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
woman 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
hiding 1
as 1
the 1
pack 1
passed 1
them 1
watching 1
every 1
move 1
of 1
the 1
ferocious 1
creatures 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
apparent 1
to 1
tarzan 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
jane 1
and 1
rokoff 1
were 1
not 1
travelling 1
together 1
the 1
spoor 1
showed 1
distinctly 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
considerable 1
distance 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
at 1
first 1
though 1
the 1
farther 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
continued 1
along 1
the 1
trail 1
the 1
more 1
obvious 1
it 1
became 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
rapidly 1
overhauling 1
his 1
quarry 1
at 1
first 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
spoor 1
of 1
wild 1
beasts 1
over 1
the 1
footprints 1
of 1
jane 1
clayton 1
while 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
all 1
rokoff 1
s 1
spoor 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
over 1
the 1
trail 1
after 1
the 1
animals 1
had 1
left 1
their 1
records 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
but 1
later 1
there 1
were 1
fewer 1
and 1
fewer 1
animal 1
imprints 1
occurring 1
between 1
those 1
of 1
jane 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
feet 1
until 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
the 1
river 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
became 1
aware 1
that 1
rokoff 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
few 1
hundred 1
yards 1
behind 1
the 1
girl 1
he 1
felt 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
close 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
now 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
thrill 1
of 1
expectation 1
he 1
leaped 1
rapidly 1
forward 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
swinging 1
swiftly 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
point 1
at 1
which 1
rokoff 1
had 1
overhauled 1
jane 1
as 1
she 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
launch 1
the 1
cumbersome 1
dugout 1
in 1
the 1
mud 1
along 1
the 1
bank 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
saw 1
the 1
footprints 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
he 1
sought 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
neither 1
boat 1
nor 1
people 1
there 1
when 1
he 1
arrived 1
nor 1
at 1
first 1
glance 1
any 1
sign 1
of 1
their 1
whereabouts 1
it 1
was 1
plain 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
shoved 1
off 1
a 1
native 1
canoe 1
and 1
embarked 1
upon 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
eye 1
ran 1
swiftly 1
down 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
beneath 1
the 1
shadows 1
of 1
the 1
overarching 1
trees 1
he 1
saw 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
rounded 1
a 1
bend 1
that 1
shut 1
it 1
off 1
from 1
his 1
view 1
a 1
drifting 1
dugout 1
in 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
pack 1
came 1
in 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
they 1
saw 1
their 1
agile 1
leader 1
racing 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
bank 1
leaping 1
from 1
hummock 1
to 1
hummock 1
of 1
the 1
swampy 1
ground 1
that 1
spread 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
promontory 1
which 1
rose 1
just 1
where 1
the 1
river 1
curved 1
inward 1
from 1
their 1
sight 1
to 1
follow 1
him 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
heavy 1
cumbersome 1
apes 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
wide 1
detour 1
and 1
sheeta 1
too 1
who 1
hated 1
water 1
mugambi 1
followed 1
after 1
them 1
as 1
rapidly 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
in 1
the 1
wake 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
white 1
master 1
a 1
half 1
hour 1
of 1
rapid 1
travelling 1
across 1
the 1
swampy 1
neck 1
of 1
land 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
rising 1
promontory 1
brought 1
tarzan 1
by 1
a 1
short 1
cut 1
to 1
the 1
inward 1
bend 1
of 1
the 1
winding 1
river 1
and 1
there 1
before 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
dugout 1
and 1
in 1
its 1
stern 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
jane 1
was 1
not 1
with 1
the 1
russian 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
his 1
enemy 1
the 1
broad 1
scar 1
upon 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
brow 1
burned 1
scarlet 1
and 1
there 1
rose 1
to 1
his 1
lips 1
the 1
hideous 1
bestial 1
challenge 1
of 1
the 1
bull 1
ape 1
rokoff 1
shuddered 1
as 1
the 1
weird 1
and 1
terrible 1
alarm 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
ears 1
cowering 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
his 1
teeth 1
chattering 1
in 1
terror 1
he 1
watched 1
the 1
man 1
he 1
feared 1
above 1
all 1
other 1
creatures 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
as 1
he 1
ran 1
quickly 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
even 1
though 1
the 1
russian 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
from 1
his 1
enemy 1
the 1
very 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
threw 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
frenzy 1
of 1
trembling 1
cowardice 1
which 1
became 1
frantic 1
hysteria 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
white 1
giant 1
dive 1
fearlessly 1
into 1
the 1
forbidding 1
waters 1
of 1
the 1
tropical 1
river 1
with 1
steady 1
powerful 1
strokes 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
forged 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
toward 1
the 1
drifting 1
dugout 1
now 1
rokoff 1
seized 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
paddles 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
craft 1
and 1
with 1
terrorwide 1
eyes 1
still 1
glued 1
upon 1
the 1
living 1
death 1
that 1
pursued 1
him 1
struck 1
out 1
madly 1
in 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
augment 1
the 1
speed 1
of 1
the 1
unwieldy 1
canoe 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
opposite 1
bank 1
a 1
sinister 1
ripple 1
unseen 1
by 1
either 1
man 1
moved 1
steadily 1
toward 1
the 1
half 1
naked 1
swimmer 1
tarzan 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
the 1
craft 1
at 1
last 1
one 1
hand 1
upstretched 1
grasped 1
the 1
gunwale 1
rokoff 1
sat 1
frozen 1
with 1
fear 1
unable 1
to 1
move 1
a 1
hand 1
or 1
foot 1
his 1
eyes 1
riveted 1
upon 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
his 1
nemesis 1
then 1
a 1
sudden 1
commotion 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
behind 1
the 1
swimmer 1
caught 1
his 1
attention 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
ripple 1
and 1
he 1
knew 1
what 1
caused 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
tarzan 1
felt 1
mighty 1
jaws 1
close 1
upon 1
his 1
right 1
leg 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
struggle 1
free 1
and 1
raise 1
himself 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
his 1
efforts 1
would 1
have 1
succeeded 1
had 1
not 1
this 1
unexpected 1
interruption 1
galvanized 1
the 1
malign 1
brain 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
into 1
instant 1
action 1
with 1
its 1
sudden 1
promise 1
of 1
deliverance 1
and 1
revenge 1
like 1
a 1
venomous 1
snake 1
the 1
man 1
leaped 1
toward 1
the 1
stern 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
swift 1
blow 1
struck 1
tarzan 1
across 1
the 1
head 1
with 1
the 1
heavy 1
paddle 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
fingers 1
slipped 1
from 1
their 1
hold 1
upon 1
the 1
gunwale 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
short 1
struggle 1
at 1
the 1
surface 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
swirl 1
of 1
waters 1
a 1
little 1
eddy 1
and 1
a 1
burst 1
of 1
bubbles 1
soon 1
smoothed 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
flowing 1
current 1
marked 1
for 1
the 1
instant 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
lord 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
disappeared 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
men 1
beneath 1
the 1
gloomy 1
waters 1
of 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
forbidding 1
ugambi 1
weak 1
from 1
terror 1
rokoff 1
sank 1
shuddering 1
into 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
dugout 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
realize 1
the 1
good 1
fortune 1
that 1
had 1
befallen 1
him 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
was 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
silent 1
struggling 1
white 1
man 1
disappearing 1
beneath 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
unthinkable 1
death 1
in 1
the 1
slimy 1
mud 1
of 1
the 1
bottom 1
slowly 1
all 1
that 1
it 1
meant 1
to 1
him 1
filtered 1
into 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
cruel 1
smile 1
of 1
relief 1
and 1
triumph 1
touched 1
his 1
lips 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
short 1
lived 1
for 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
congratulating 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
comparatively 1
safe 1
to 1
proceed 1
upon 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
coast 1
unmolested 1
a 1
mighty 1
pandemonium 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
close 1
by 1
as 1
his 1
eyes 1
sought 1
the 1
authors 1
of 1
the 1
frightful 1
sound 1
he 1
saw 1
standing 1
upon 1
the 1
shore 1
glaring 1
at 1
him 1
with 1
hate 1
filled 1
eyes 1
a 1
devil 1
faced 1
panther 1
surrounded 1
by 1
the 1
hideous 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
forefront 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
giant 1
black 1
warrior 1
who 1
shook 1
his 1
fist 1
at 1
him 1
threatening 1
him 1
with 1
terrible 1
death 1
the 1
nightmare 1
of 1
that 1
flight 1
down 1
the 1
ugambi 1
with 1
the 1
hideous 1
horde 1
racing 1
after 1
him 1
by 1
day 1
and 1
by 1
night 1
now 1
abreast 1
of 1
him 1
now 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
mazes 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
far 1
behind 1
for 1
hours 1
and 1
once 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
day 1
only 1
to 1
reappear 1
again 1
upon 1
his 1
trail 1
grim 1
relentless 1
and 1
terrible 1
reduced 1
the 1
russian 1
from 1
a 1
strong 1
and 1
robust 1
man 1
to 1
an 1
emaciated 1
white 1
haired 1
fear 1
gibbering 1
thing 1
before 1
ever 1
the 1
bay 1
and 1
the 1
ocean 1
broke 1
upon 1
his 1
hopeless 1
vision 1
past 1
populous 1
villages 1
he 1
had 1
fled 1
time 1
and 1
again 1
warriors 1
had 1
put 1
out 1
in 1
their 1
canoes 1
to 1
intercept 1
him 1
but 1
each 1
time 1
the 1
hideous 1
horde 1
had 1
swept 1
into 1
view 1
to 1
send 1
the 1
terrified 1
natives 1
shrieking 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
to 1
lose 1
themselves 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
nowhere 1
in 1
his 1
flight 1
had 1
he 1
seen 1
aught 1
of 1
jane 1
clayton 1
not 1
once 1
had 1
his 1
eyes 1
rested 1
upon 1
her 1
since 1
that 1
moment 1
at 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
brim 1
his 1
hand 1
had 1
closed 1
upon 1
the 1
rope 1
attached 1
to 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
her 1
dugout 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
believed 1
her 1
safely 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
again 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
thwarted 1
an 1
instant 1
later 1
as 1
the 1
girl 1
snatched 1
up 1
a 1
heavy 1
express 1
rifle 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
craft 1
and 1
levelled 1
it 1
full 1
at 1
his 1
breast 1
quickly 1
he 1
had 1
dropped 1
the 1
rope 1
then 1
and 1
seen 1
her 1
float 1
away 1
beyond 1
his 1
reach 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
racing 1
up 1
stream 1
toward 1
a 1
little 1
tributary 1
in 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
hidden 1
the 1
canoe 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
party 1
had 1
come 1
thus 1
far 1
upon 1
their 1
journey 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
the 1
girl 1
and 1
anderssen 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
her 1
there 1
seemed 1
little 1
doubt 1
in 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
mind 1
however 1
but 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
captured 1
by 1
warriors 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
several 1
villages 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
compelled 1
to 1
pass 1
on 1
her 1
way 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
well 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
rid 1
of 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
human 1
enemies 1
but 1
at 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
gladly 1
have 1
had 1
them 1
all 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
could 1
he 1
thus 1
have 1
been 1
freed 1
from 1
the 1
menace 1
of 1
the 1
frightful 1
creatures 1
who 1
pursued 1
him 1
with 1
awful 1
relentlessness 1
screaming 1
and 1
growling 1
at 1
him 1
every 1
time 1
they 1
came 1
within 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
terror 1
was 1
the 1
panther 1
the 1
flaming 1
eyed 1
devil 1
faced 1
panther 1
whose 1
grinning 1
jaws 1
gaped 1
wide 1
at 1
him 1
by 1
day 1
and 1
whose 1
fiery 1
orbs 1
gleamed 1
wickedly 1
out 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
from 1
the 1
cimmerian 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
nights 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
filled 1
rokoff 1
with 1
renewed 1
hope 1
for 1
there 1
upon 1
the 1
yellow 1
waters 1
of 1
the 1
bay 1
floated 1
the 1
kincaid 1
at 1
anchor 1
he 1
had 1
sent 1
the 1
little 1
steamer 1
away 1
to 1
coal 1
while 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
leaving 1
paulvitch 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
her 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
cried 1
aloud 1
in 1
his 1
relief 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
returned 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
save 1
him 1
frantically 1
he 1
alternately 1
paddled 1
furiously 1
toward 1
her 1
and 1
rose 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
waving 1
his 1
paddle 1
and 1
crying 1
aloud 1
in 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
attract 1
the 1
attention 1
of 1
those 1
on 1
board 1
but 1
loud 1
as 1
he 1
screamed 1
his 1
cries 1
awakened 1
no 1
answering 1
challenge 1
from 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
silent 1
craft 1
upon 1
the 1
shore 1
behind 1
him 1
a 1
hurried 1
backward 1
glance 1
revealed 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
snarling 1
pack 1
even 1
now 1
he 1
thought 1
these 1
manlike 1
devils 1
might 1
yet 1
find 1
a 1
way 1
to 1
reach 1
him 1
even 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
steamer 1
unless 1
there 1
were 1
those 1
there 1
to 1
repel 1
them 1
with 1
firearms 1
what 1
could 1
have 1
happened 1
to 1
those 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
upon 1
the 1
kincaid 1
where 1
was 1
paulvitch 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
that 1
the 1
vessel 1
was 1
deserted 1
and 1
that 1
after 1
all 1
he 1
was 1
doomed 1
to 1
be 1
overtaken 1
by 1
the 1
terrible 1
fate 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
flying 1
from 1
through 1
all 1
these 1
hideous 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
he 1
shivered 1
as 1
might 1
one 1
upon 1
whose 1
brow 1
death 1
has 1
already 1
laid 1
his 1
clammy 1
finger 1
yet 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
cease 1
to 1
paddle 1
frantically 1
toward 1
the 1
steamer 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
after 1
what 1
seemed 1
an 1
eternity 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
dugout 1
bumped 1
against 1
the 1
timbers 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
over 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
side 1
hung 1
a 1
monkey 1
ladder 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
russian 1
grasped 1
it 1
to 1
ascend 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
warning 1
challenge 1
from 1
above 1
and 1
looking 1
up 1
gazed 1
into 1
the 1
cold 1
relentless 1
muzzle 1
of 1
a 1
rifle 1
after 1
jane 1
clayton 1
with 1
rifle 1
levelled 1
at 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
rokoff 1
had 1
succeeded 1
in 1
holding 1
him 1
off 1
until 1
the 1
dugout 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
taken 1
refuge 1
had 1
drifted 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
beyond 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
reach 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
no 1
time 1
in 1
paddling 1
to 1
the 1
swiftest 1
sweep 1
of 1
the 1
channel 1
nor 1
did 1
she 1
for 1
long 1
days 1
and 1
weary 1
nights 1
cease 1
to 1
hold 1
her 1
craft 1
to 1
the 1
most 1
rapidly 1
moving 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
except 1
when 1
during 1
the 1
hottest 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
wont 1
to 1
drift 1
as 1
the 1
current 1
would 1
take 1
her 1
lying 1
prone 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
her 1
face 1
sheltered 1
from 1
the 1
sun 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
palm 1
leaf 1
thus 1
only 1
did 1
she 1
gain 1
rest 1
upon 1
the 1
voyage 1
at 1
other 1
times 1
she 1
continually 1
sought 1
to 1
augment 1
the 1
movement 1
of 1
the 1
craft 1
by 1
wielding 1
the 1
heavy 1
paddle 1
rokoff 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
had 1
used 1
little 1
or 1
no 1
intelligence 1
in 1
his 1
flight 1
along 1
the 1
ugambi 1
so 1
that 1
more 1
often 1
than 1
not 1
his 1
craft 1
had 1
drifted 1
in 1
the 1
slow 1
going 1
eddies 1
for 1
he 1
habitually 1
hugged 1
the 1
bank 1
farthest 1
from 1
that 1
along 1
which 1
the 1
hideous 1
horde 1
pursued 1
and 1
menaced 1
him 1
thus 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
put 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
river 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
time 1
subsequent 1
to 1
the 1
girl 1
yet 1
she 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
bay 1
fully 1
two 1
hours 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
first 1
seen 1
the 1
anchored 1
ship 1
upon 1
the 1
quiet 1
water 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
heart 1
had 1
beat 1
fast 1
with 1
hope 1
and 1
thanksgiving 1
but 1
as 1
she 1
drew 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
craft 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
kincaid 1
her 1
pleasure 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
the 1
gravest 1
misgivings 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
however 1
to 1
turn 1
back 1
for 1
the 1
current 1
that 1
carried 1
her 1
toward 1
the 1
ship 1
was 1
much 1
too 1
strong 1
for 1
her 1
muscles 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
forced 1
the 1
heavy 1
dugout 1
up 1
stream 1
against 1
it 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
was 1
left 1
her 1
was 1
to 1
attempt 1
either 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
shore 1
without 1
being 1
seen 1
by 1
those 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
or 1
to 1
throw 1
herself 1
upon 1
their 1
mercy 1
otherwise 1
she 1
must 1
be 1
swept 1
out 1
to 1
sea 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
shore 1
held 1
little 1
hope 1
of 1
life 1
for 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
location 1
of 1
the 1
friendly 1
mosula 1
village 1
to 1
which 1
anderssen 1
had 1
taken 1
her 1
through 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
their 1
escape 1
from 1
the 1
kincaid 1
with 1
rokoff 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
steamer 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
possible 1
that 1
by 1
offering 1
those 1
in 1
charge 1
a 1
large 1
reward 1
they 1
could 1
be 1
induced 1
to 1
carry 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
nearest 1
civilized 1
port 1
it 1
was 1
worth 1
risking 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
make 1
the 1
steamer 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
current 1
was 1
bearing 1
her 1
swiftly 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
she 1
found 1
that 1
only 1
by 1
dint 1
of 1
the 1
utmost 1
exertion 1
could 1
she 1
direct 1
the 1
awkward 1
craft 1
toward 1
the 1
vicinity 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
having 1
reached 1
the 1
decision 1
to 1
board 1
the 1
steamer 1
she 1
now 1
looked 1
to 1
it 1
for 1
aid 1
but 1
to 1
her 1
surprise 1
the 1
decks 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
empty 1
and 1
she 1
saw 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
life 1
aboard 1
the 1
ship 1
the 1
dugout 1
was 1
drawing 1
closer 1
and 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
vessel 1
and 1
yet 1
no 1
hail 1
came 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
from 1
any 1
lookout 1
aboard 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
more 1
jane 1
realized 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
swept 1
beyond 1
the 1
steamer 1
and 1
then 1
unless 1
they 1
lowered 1
a 1
boat 1
to 1
rescue 1
her 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
carried 1
far 1
out 1
to 1
sea 1
by 1
the 1
current 1
and 1
the 1
swift 1
ebb 1
tide 1
that 1
was 1
running 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
called 1
loudly 1
for 1
assistance 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
reply 1
other 1
than 1
the 1
shrill 1
scream 1
of 1
some 1
savage 1
beast 1
upon 1
the 1
jungle 1
shrouded 1
shore 1
frantically 1
jane 1
wielded 1
the 1
paddle 1
in 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
carry 1
her 1
craft 1
close 1
alongside 1
the 1
steamer 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
miss 1
her 1
goal 1
by 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
but 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
moment 1
the 1
canoe 1
swung 1
close 1
beneath 1
the 1
steamer 1
s 1
bow 1
and 1
jane 1
barely 1
managed 1
to 1
grasp 1
the 1
anchor 1
chain 1
heroically 1
she 1
clung 1
to 1
the 1
heavy 1
iron 1
links 1
almost 1
dragged 1
from 1
the 1
canoe 1
by 1
the 1
strain 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
upon 1
her 1
craft 1
beyond 1
her 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
monkey 1
ladder 1
dangling 1
over 1
the 1
steamer 1
s 1
side 1
to 1
release 1
her 1
hold 1
upon 1
the 1
chain 1
and 1
chance 1
clambering 1
to 1
the 1
ladder 1
as 1
her 1
canoe 1
was 1
swept 1
beneath 1
it 1
seemed 1
beyond 1
the 1
pale 1
of 1
possibility 1
yet 1
to 1
remain 1
clinging 1
to 1
the 1
anchor 1
chain 1
appeared 1
equally 1
as 1
futile 1
finally 1
her 1
glance 1
chanced 1
to 1
fall 1
upon 1
the 1
rope 1
in 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
dugout 1
and 1
making 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
fast 1
to 1
the 1
chain 1
she 1
succeeded 1
in 1
drifting 1
the 1
canoe 1
slowly 1
down 1
until 1
it 1
lay 1
directly 1
beneath 1
the 1
ladder 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
her 1
rifle 1
slung 1
about 1
her 1
shoulders 1
she 1
had 1
clambered 1
safely 1
to 1
the 1
deserted 1
deck 1
her 1
first 1
task 1
was 1
to 1
explore 1
the 1
ship 1
and 1
this 1
she 1
did 1
her 1
rifle 1
ready 1
for 1
instant 1
use 1
should 1
she 1
meet 1
with 1
any 1
human 1
menace 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
in 1
discovering 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
apparently 1
deserted 1
condition 1
of 1
the 1
steamer 1
for 1
in 1
the 1
forecastle 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
sailors 1
who 1
had 1
evidently 1
been 1
left 1
to 1
guard 1
the 1
ship 1
deep 1
in 1
drunken 1
slumber 1
with 1
a 1
shudder 1
of 1
disgust 1
she 1
clambered 1
above 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
her 1
ability 1
closed 1
and 1
made 1
fast 1
the 1
hatch 1
above 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
the 1
sleeping 1
guard 1
next 1
she 1
sought 1
the 1
galley 1
and 1
food 1
and 1
having 1
appeased 1
her 1
hunger 1
she 1
took 1
her 1
place 1
on 1
deck 1
determined 1
that 1
none 1
should 1
board 1
the 1
kincaid 1
without 1
first 1
having 1
agreed 1
to 1
her 1
demands 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
nothing 1
appeared 1
upon 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
cause 1
her 1
alarm 1
but 1
then 1
about 1
a 1
bend 1
up 1
stream 1
she 1
saw 1
a 1
canoe 1
appear 1
in 1
which 1
sat 1
a 1
single 1
figure 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
proceeded 1
far 1
in 1
her 1
direction 1
before 1
she 1
recognized 1
the 1
occupant 1
as 1
rokoff 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
fellow 1
attempted 1
to 1
board 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
rifle 1
staring 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
when 1
the 1
russian 1
discovered 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
repelled 1
his 1
advance 1

became 1
furious 1
cursing 1
and 1
threatening 1
in 1
a 1
most 1
horrible 1
manner 1
but 1
finding 1
that 1
these 1
tactics 1
failed 1
to 1
frighten 1
or 1
move 1
the 1
girl 1
he 1
at 1
last 1
fell 1
to 1
pleading 1
and 1
promising 1
jane 1
had 1
but 1
a 1
single 1
reply 1
for 1
his 1
every 1
proposition 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
that 1
nothing 1
would 1
ever 1
persuade 1
her 1
to 1
permit 1
rokoff 1
upon 1
the 1

vessel 1
with 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
put 1
her 1
threats 1
into 1
action 1
and 1
shoot 1

he 1
persist 1
in 1
his 1
endeavour 1
to 1
board 1
the 1
ship 1
he 1
was 1
convinced 1
so 1
as 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
alternative 1
the 1
great 1
coward 1
dropped 1
back 1
into 1
his 1
dugout 1
and 1
at 1
imminent 1
risk 1
of 1
being 1
swept 1
to 1
sea 1
finally 1
succeeded 1
in 1
making 1
the 1
shore 1
far 1
down 1
the 1
bay 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
from 1
that 1
on 1
which 1
the 1

that 1
the 1
fellow 1
could 1
not 1
alone 1
and 1
unaided 1
bring 1
his 1
heavy 1
craft 1
back 1
up 1
stream 1
to 1
the 1

and 1
so 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
further 1
fear 1
of 1
an 1
attack 1
by 1
him 1

recognized 1

that 1

her 1
in 1

up 1

a 1

later 1
following 1
the 1

of 1
his 1
gaze 1
she 1
was 1
terrified 1
to 1
see 1
a 1

16 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
when 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
realized 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
grip 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
jaws 1
of 1
a 1
crocodile 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
as 1
an 1
ordinary 1
man 1
might 1
have 1
done 1
give 1
up 1
all 1
hope 1
and 1
resign 1
himself 1
to 1
his 1
fate 1
instead 1
he 1
filled 1
his 1
lungs 1
with 1
air 1
before 1
the 1
huge 1
reptile 1
dragged 1
him 1
beneath 1
the 1
surface 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
might 1
of 1
his 1
great 1
muscles 1
fought 1
bitterly 1
for 1
freedom 1
but 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
native 1
element 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
was 1
too 1
greatly 1
handicapped 1
to 1
do 1
more 1
than 1
excite 1
the 1
monster 1
to 1
greater 1
speed 1
as 1
it 1
dragged 1
its 1
prey 1
swiftly 1
through 1
the 1
water 1
tarzan 1
s 1
lungs 1
were 1
bursting 1
for 1
a 1
breath 1
of 1
pure 1
fresh 1
air 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
survive 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
more 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
paroxysm 1
of 1
his 1
suffering 1
he 1
did 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
avenge 1
his 1
own 1
death 1
his 1
body 1
trailed 1
out 1
beside 1
the 1
slimy 1
carcass 1
of 1
his 1
captor 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
tough 1
armour 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
attempted 1
to 1
plunge 1
his 1
stone 1
knife 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
borne 1
to 1
the 1
creature 1
s 1
horrid 1
den 1
his 1
efforts 1
but 1
served 1
to 1
accelerate 1
the 1
speed 1
of 1
the 1
crocodile 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
realized 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
limit 1
of 1
his 1
endurance 1
he 1
felt 1
his 1
body 1
dragged 1
to 1
a 1
muddy 1
bed 1
and 1
his 1
nostrils 1
rise 1
above 1
the 1
water 1
s 1
surface 1
all 1
about 1
him 1
was 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
pit 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
lay 1
gasping 1
for 1
breath 1
upon 1
the 1
slimy 1
evil 1
smelling 1
bed 1
to 1
which 1
the 1
animal 1
had 1
borne 1
him 1
close 1
at 1
his 1
side 1
he 1
could 1
feel 1
the 1
cold 1
hard 1
plates 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
s 1
coat 1
rising 1
and 1
falling 1
as 1
though 1
with 1
spasmodic 1
efforts 1
to 1
breathe 1
for 1
several 1
minutes 1
the 1
two 1
lay 1
thus 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
sudden 1
convulsion 1
of 1
the 1
giant 1
carcass 1
at 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
side 1
a 1
tremor 1
and 1
a 1
stiffening 1
brought 1
tarzan 1
to 1
his 1
knees 1
beside 1
the 1
crocodile 1
to 1
his 1
utter 1
amazement 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
beast 1
was 1
dead 1
the 1
slim 1
knife 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
vulnerable 1
spot 1
in 1
the 1
scaly 1
armour 1
staggering 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
groped 1
about 1
the 1
reeking 1
oozy 1
den 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
imprisoned 1
in 1
a 1
subterranean 1
chamber 1
amply 1
large 1
enough 1
to 1
have 1
accommodated 1
a 1
dozen 1
or 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
huge 1
animals 1
such 1
as 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
had 1
dragged 1
him 1
thither 1
he 1
realized 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
creature 1
s 1
hidden 1
nest 1
far 1
under 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
and 1
that 1
doubtless 1
the 1
only 1
means 1
of 1
ingress 1
or 1
egress 1
lay 1
through 1
the 1
submerged 1
opening 1
through 1
which 1
the 1
crocodile 1
had 1
brought 1
him 1
his 1
first 1
thought 1
of 1
course 1
was 1
of 1
escape 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
make 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
beyond 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
seemed 1
highly 1
improbable 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
turns 1
and 1
windings 1
in 1
the 1
neck 1
of 1
the 1
passage 1
or 1
most 1
to 1
be 1
feared 1
he 1
might 1
meet 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
slimy 1
inhabitants 1
of 1
the 1
retreat 1
upon 1
his 1
journey 1
outward 1
even 1
should 1
he 1
reach 1
the 1
river 1
in 1
safety 1
there 1
was 1
still 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
his 1
being 1
again 1
attacked 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
effect 1
a 1
safe 1
landing 1
still 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
alternative 1
and 1
filling 1
his 1
lungs 1
with 1
the 1
close 1
and 1
reeking 1
air 1
of 1
the 1
chamber 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
dived 1
into 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
watery 1
hole 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
but 1
had 1
felt 1
out 1
and 1
found 1
with 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
legs 1
the 1
leg 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
held 1
within 1
the 1
jaws 1
of 1
the 1
crocodile 1
was 1
badly 1
lacerated 1
but 1
the 1
bone 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
broken 1
nor 1
were 1
the 1
muscles 1
or 1
tendons 1
sufficiently 1
injured 1
to 1
render 1
it 1
useless 1
it 1
gave 1
him 1
excruciating 1
pain 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
but 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
was 1
accustomed 1
to 1
pain 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
no 1
further 1
thought 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
his 1
legs 1
was 1
not 1
greatly 1
impaired 1
by 1
the 1
sharp 1
teeth 1
of 1
the 1
monster 1
rapidly 1
he 1
crawled 1
and 1
swam 1
through 1
the 1
passage 1
which 1
inclined 1
downward 1
and 1
finally 1
upward 1
to 1
open 1
at 1
last 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
bottom 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
line 1
as 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
reached 1
the 1
surface 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
two 1
great 1
crocodiles 1
but 1
a 1
short 1
distance 1
from 1
him 1
they 1
were 1
making 1
rapidly 1
in 1
his 1
direction 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
superhuman 1
effort 1
the 1
man 1
struck 1
out 1
for 1
the 1
overhanging 1
branches 1
of 1
a 1
near 1
by 1
tree 1
nor 1
was 1
he 1
a 1
moment 1
too 1
soon 1
for 1
scarcely 1
had 1
he 1
drawn 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
the 1
limb 1
than 1
two 1
gaping 1
mouths 1
snapped 1
venomously 1
below 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
tarzan 1
rested 1
in 1
the 1
tree 1
that 1
had 1
proved 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
his 1
salvation 1
his 1
eyes 1
scanned 1
the 1
river 1
as 1
far 1
down 1
stream 1
as 1
the 1
tortuous 1
channel 1
would 1
permit 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
or 1
his 1
dugout 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
rested 1
and 1
bound 1
up 1
his 1
wounded 1
leg 1
he 1
started 1
on 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
the 1
drifting 1
canoe 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
to 1
that 1
at 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
entered 1
the 1
stream 1
but 1
as 1
his 1
quarry 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
it 1
made 1
little 1
difference 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
upon 1
which 1
side 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
pursuit 1
to 1
his 1
intense 1
chagrin 1
he 1
soon 1
found 1
that 1
his 1
leg 1
was 1
more 1
badly 1
injured 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
and 1
that 1
its 1
condition 1
seriously 1
impeded 1
his 1
progress 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
difficulty 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
proceed 1
faster 1
than 1
a 1
walk 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
trees 1
he 1
discovered 1
that 1
it 1
not 1
only 1
impeded 1
his 1
progress 1
but 1
rendered 1
travelling 1
distinctly 1
dangerous 1
from 1
the 1
old 1
negress 1
tambudza 1
tarzan 1
had 1
gathered 1
a 1
suggestion 1
that 1
now 1
filled 1
his 1
mind 1
with 1
doubts 1
and 1
misgivings 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
woman 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
death 1
she 1
had 1
also 1
added 1
that 1
the 1
white 1
woman 1
though 1
grief 1
stricken 1
had 1
confided 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
the 1
baby 1
was 1
not 1
hers 1
tarzan 1
could 1
see 1
no 1
reason 1
for 1
believing 1
that 1
jane 1
could 1
have 1
found 1
it 1
advisable 1
to 1
deny 1
her 1
identity 1
or 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
the 1
only 1
explanation 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
put 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
that 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
white 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
accompanied 1
his 1
son 1
and 1
the 1
swede 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
fastness 1
of 1
the 1
interior 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
jane 1
at 1
all 1
the 1
more 1
he 1
gave 1
thought 1
to 1
the 1
problem 1
the 1
more 1
firmly 1
convinced 1
he 1
became 1
that 1
his 1
son 1
was 1
dead 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
still 1
safe 1
in 1
london 1
and 1
in 1
ignorance 1
of 1
the 1
terrible 1
fate 1
that 1
had 1
overtaken 1
her 1
first 1
born 1
after 1
all 1
then 1
his 1
interpretation 1
of 1
rokoff 1
s 1
sinister 1
taunt 1
had 1
been 1
erroneous 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
bearing 1
the 1
burden 1
of 1
a 1
double 1
apprehension 1
needlessly 1
at 1
least 1
so 1
thought 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
from 1
this 1
belief 1
he 1
garnered 1
some 1
slight 1
surcease 1
from 1
the 1
numbing 1
grief 1
that 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
his 1
little 1
son 1
had 1
thrust 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
death 1
even 1
the 1
savage 1
beast 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
real 1
tarzan 1
inured 1
to 1
the 1
sufferings 1
and 1
horrors 1
of 1
the 1
grim 1
jungle 1
shuddered 1
as 1
he 1
contemplated 1
the 1
hideous 1
fate 1
that 1
had 1
overtaken 1
the 1
innocent 1
child 1
as 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
way 1
painfully 1
towards 1
the 1
coast 1
he 1
let 1
his 1
mind 1
dwell 1
so 1
constantly 1
upon 1
the 1
frightful 1
crimes 1
which 1
the 1
russian 1
had 1
perpetrated 1
against 1
his 1
loved 1
ones 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
scar 1
upon 1
his 1
forehead 1
stood 1
out 1
almost 1
continuously 1
in 1
the 1
vivid 1
scarlet 1
that 1
marked 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
most 1
relentless 1
and 1
bestial 1
moods 1
of 1
rage 1
at 1
times 1
he 1
startled 1
even 1
himself 1
and 1
sent 1
the 1
lesser 1
creatures 1
of 1
the 1
wild 1
jungle 1
scampering 1
to 1
their 1
hiding 1
places 1
as 1
involuntary 1
roars 1
and 1
growls 1
rumbled 1
from 1
his 1
throat 1
could 1
he 1
but 1
lay 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
russian 1
twice 1
upon 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
coast 1
bellicose 1
natives 1
ran 1
threateningly 1
from 1
their 1
villages 1
to 1
bar 1
his 1
further 1
progress 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
awful 1
cry 1
of 1
the 1
bull 1
ape 1
thundered 1
upon 1
their 1
affrighted 1
ears 1
and 1
the 1
great 1
white 1
giant 1
charged 1
bellowing 1
upon 1
them 1
they 1
had 1
turned 1
and 1
fled 1
into 1
the 1
bush 1
nor 1
ventured 1
thence 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
safely 1
passed 1
though 1
his 1
progress 1
seemed 1
tantalizingly 1
slow 1
to 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
whose 1
idea 1
of 1
speed 1
had 1
been 1
gained 1
by 1
such 1
standards 1
as 1
the 1
lesser 1
apes 1
attain 1
he 1
made 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fact 1
almost 1
as 1
rapid 1
progress 1
as 1
the 1
drifting 1
canoe 1
that 1
bore 1
rokoff 1
on 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
bay 1
and 1
within 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
ocean 1
just 1
after 1
darkness 1
had 1
fallen 1
upon 1
the 1
same 1
day 1
that 1
jane 1
clayton 1
and 1
the 1
russian 1
ended 1
their 1
flights 1
from 1
the 1
interior 1
the 1
darkness 1
lowered 1
so 1
heavily 1
upon 1
the 1
black 1
river 1
and 1
the 1
encircling 1
jungle 1
that 1
tarzan 1
even 1
with 1
eyes 1
accustomed 1
to 1
much 1
use 1
after 1
dark 1
could 1
make 1
out 1
nothing 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
from 1
him 1
his 1
idea 1
was 1
to 1
search 1
the 1
shore 1
that 1
night 1
for 1
signs 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
and 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
certain 1
must 1
have 1
preceded 1
rokoff 1
down 1
the 1
ugambi 1
that 1
the 1
kincaid 1
or 1
other 1
ship 1
lay 1
at 1
anchor 1
but 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
him 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
dream 1
for 1
no 1
light 1
showed 1
on 1
board 1
the 1
steamer 1
even 1
as 1
he 1
commenced 1
his 1
search 1
his 1
attention 1
was 1
suddenly 1
attracted 1
by 1
a 1
noise 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
at 1
first 1
perceived 1
the 1
stealthy 1
dip 1
of 1
paddles 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
some 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
about 1
opposite 1
the 1
point 1
at 1
which 1
he 1
stood 1
motionless 1
as 1
a 1
statue 1
he 1
stood 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
faint 1
sound 1
presently 1
it 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
shuffling 1
noise 1
that 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
trained 1
ears 1
could 1
interpret 1
as 1
resulting 1
from 1
but 1
a 1
single 1
cause 1
the 1
scraping 1
of 1
leather 1
shod 1
feet 1
upon 1
the 1
rounds 1
of 1
a 1
ship 1
s 1
monkey 1
ladder 1
and 1
yet 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
ship 1
there 1
nor 1
might 1
there 1
be 1
one 1
within 1
a 1
thousand 1
miles 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
thus 1
peering 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
cloud 1
enshrouded 1
night 1
there 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
from 1
across 1
the 1
water 1
like 1
a 1
slap 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
so 1
sudden 1
and 1
unexpected 1
was 1
it 1
the 1
sharp 1
staccato 1
of 1
an 1
exchange 1
of 1
shots 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
wounded 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
his 1
recent 1
horrible 1
experience 1
still 1
strong 1
upon 1
him 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
did 1
not 1
hesitate 1
as 1
the 1
notes 1
of 1
that 1
frightened 1
cry 1
rose 1
shrill 1
and 1
piercing 1
upon 1
the 1
still 1
night 1
air 1
with 1
a 1
bound 1
he 1
cleared 1
the 1
intervening 1
bush 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
splash 1
as 1
the 1
water 1
closed 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
powerful 1
strokes 1
he 1
swam 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
impenetrable 1
night 1
with 1
no 1
guide 1
save 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
an 1
illusive 1
cry 1
and 1
for 1
company 1
the 1
hideous 1
denizens 1
of 1
an 1
equatorial 1
river 1
the 1
boat 1
that 1
had 1
attracted 1
jane 1
s 1
attention 1
as 1
she 1
stood 1
guard 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
had 1
been 1
perceived 1
by 1
rokoff 1
upon 1
one 1
bank 1
and 1
mugambi 1
and 1
the 1
horde 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
the 1
cries 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
had 1
brought 1
the 1
dugout 1
first 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
after 1
a 1
conference 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
turned 1
toward 1
the 1
kincaid 1
but 1
before 1
ever 1
it 1
covered 1
half 1
the 1
distance 1
between 1
the 1
shore 1
and 1
the 1
steamer 1
a 1
rifle 1
had 1
spoken 1
from 1
the 1
latter 1
s 1
deck 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
sailors 1
in 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
had 1
crumpled 1
and 1
fallen 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
after 1
that 1
they 1
went 1
more 1
slowly 1
and 1
presently 1
when 1
jane 1
s 1
rifle 1
had 1
found 1
another 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
party 1
the 1
canoe 1
withdrew 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
where 1
it 1
lay 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
daylight 1
lasted 1
the 1
savage 1
snarling 1
pack 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
shore 1
had 1
been 1
directed 1
in 1
their 1
pursuit 1
by 1
the 1
black 1
warrior 1
mugambi 1
chief 1
of 1
the 1
wagambi 1
only 1
he 1
knew 1
which 1
might 1
be 1
foe 1
and 1
which 1
friend 1
of 1
their 1
lost 1
master 1
could 1
they 1
have 1
reached 1
either 1
the 1
canoe 1
or 1
the 1
kincaid 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
made 1
short 1
work 1
of 1
any 1
whom 1
they 1
found 1
there 1
but 1
the 1
gulf 1
of 1
black 1
water 1
intervening 1
shut 1
them 1
off 1
from 1
farther 1
advance 1
as 1
effectually 1
as 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
broad 1
ocean 1
that 1
separated 1
them 1
from 1
their 1
prey 1
mugambi 1
knew 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
occurrences 1
which 1
had 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
landing 1
of 1
tarzan 1
upon 1
jungle 1
island 1
and 1
the 1
pursuit 1
of 1
the 1
whites 1
up 1
the 1
ugambi 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
his 1
savage 1
master 1
sought 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
child 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
stolen 1
by 1
the 1
wicked 1
white 1
man 1
whom 1
they 1
had 1
followed 1
far 1
into 1
the 1
interior 1
and 1
now 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
he 1
believed 1
also 1
that 1
this 1
same 1
man 1
had 1
killed 1
the 1
great 1
white 1
giant 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
respect 1
and 1
love 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
loved 1
the 1
greatest 1
chiefs 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
people 1
and 1
so 1
in 1
the 1
wild 1
breast 1
of 1
mugambi 1
burned 1
an 1
iron 1
resolve 1
to 1
win 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
wicked 1
one 1
and 1
wreak 1
vengeance 1
upon 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
canoe 1
come 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
take 1
in 1
rokoff 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
make 1
for 1
the 1
kincaid 1
he 1
realized 1
that 1
only 1
by 1
possessing 1
himself 1
of 1
a 1
canoe 1
could 1
he 1
hope 1
to 1
transport 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
pack 1
within 1
striking 1
distance 1
of 1
the 1
enemy 1
so 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
even 1
before 1
jane 1
clayton 1
fired 1
the 1
first 1
shot 1
into 1
rokoff 1
s 1
canoe 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
tarzan 1
had 1
disappeared 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
after 1
the 1
russian 1
and 1
his 1
party 1
which 1
consisted 1
of 1
paulvitch 1
and 1
the 1
several 1
men 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
upon 1
the 1
kincaid 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
coaling 1
had 1
retreated 1
before 1
her 1
fire 1
jane 1
realized 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
but 1
a 1
temporary 1
respite 1
from 1
their 1
attentions 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
gained 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
conviction 1
came 1
a 1
determination 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
bold 1
and 1
final 1
stroke 1
for 1
freedom 1
from 1
the 1
menacing 1
threat 1
of 1
rokoff 1
s 1
evil 1
purpose 1
with 1
this 1
idea 1
in 1
view 1
she 1
opened 1
negotiations 1
with 1
the 1
two 1
sailors 1
she 1
had 1
imprisoned 1
in 1
the 1
forecastle 1
and 1
having 1
forced 1
their 1
consent 1
to 1
her 1
plans 1
upon 1
pain 1
of 1
death 1
should 1
they 1
attempt 1
disloyalty 1
she 1
released 1
them 1
just 1
as 1
darkness 1
closed 1
about 1
the 1
ship 1
with 1
ready 1
revolver 1
to 1
compel 1
obedience 1
she 1
let 1
them 1
up 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
searching 1
them 1
carefully 1
for 1
concealed 1
weapons 1
as 1
they 1
stood 1
with 1
hands 1
elevated 1
above 1
their 1
heads 1
once 1
satisfied 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
unarmed 1
she 1
set 1
them 1
to 1
work 1
cutting 1
the 1
cable 1
which 1
held 1
the 1
kincaid 1
to 1
her 1
anchorage 1
for 1
her 1
bold 1
plan 1
was 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
to 1
set 1
the 1
steamer 1
adrift 1
and 1
float 1
with 1
her 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
there 1
to 1
trust 1
to 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
the 1
elements 1
which 1
she 1
was 1
confident 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
more 1
merciless 1
than 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
should 1
he 1
again 1
capture 1
her 1
there 1
was 1
too 1
the 1
chance 1
that 1
the 1
kincaid 1
might 1
be 1
sighted 1
by 1
some 1
passing 1
ship 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
well 1
stocked 1
with 1
provisions 1
and 1
water 1
the 1
men 1
had 1
assured 1
her 1
of 1
this 1
fact 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
season 1
of 1

over 1
she 1
had 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
hope 1
for 1
the 1
eventual 1
success 1
of 1
her 1
plan 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
deeply 1
overcast 1
heavy 1
clouds 1
riding 1
low 1
above 1
the 1
jungle 1
and 1
the 1
water 1
only 1
to 1
the 1
west 1
where 1
the 1
broad 1
ocean 1
spread 1
beyond 1
the 1

was 1
there 1
a 1
suggestion 1
of 1
lessening 1

it 1
was 1
a 1
perfect 1
night 1
for 1
the 1
purposes 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
in 1
hand 1
her 1
enemies 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
the 1
activity 1
aboard 1
the 1
ship 1
nor 1
mark 1
her 1
course 1
as 1
the 1
swift 1
current 1
bore 1
her 1
outward 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
before 1
daylight 1
broke 1
the 1
ebb 1
tide 1
would 1
have 1
carried 1
the 1
kincaid 1
well 1
into 1
the 1
benguela 1
current 1
which 1
flows 1
northward 1
along 1
the 1
coast 1
of 1
africa 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
south 1
wind 1
was 1
prevailing 1
jane 1
hoped 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
before 1
rokoff 1
could 1
become 1
aware 1
of 1
the 1
departure 1
of 1
the 1
steamer 1
standing 1
over 1
the 1
labouring 1
seamen 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
breathed 1
a 1
sigh 1
of 1
relief 1
as 1
the 1
last 1
strand 1
of 1
the 1
cable 1
parted 1
and 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
vessel 1
was 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
maw 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
ugambi 1
with 1
her 1
two 1
prisoners 1
still 1
beneath 1
the 1
coercing 1
influence 1
of 1
her 1
rifle 1
she 1
ordered 1
them 1
upon 1
deck 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
of 1
again 1
imprisoning 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
forecastle 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
she 1
permitted 1
herself 1
to 1
be 1
influenced 1
by 1
their 1
promises 1
of 1
loyalty 1
and 1
the 1
arguments 1
which 1
they 1
put 1
forth 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
be 1
of 1
service 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
permitted 1
them 1
to 1
remain 1
above 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
the 1
kincaid 1
drifted 1
rapidly 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
a 1
grinding 1
jar 1
she 1
stopped 1
in 1
midstream 1
the 1
ship 1
had 1
run 1
upon 1
a 1
low 1
lying 1
bar 1
that 1
splits 1
the 1
channel 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
from 1
the 1
sea 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
she 1
hung 1
there 1
and 1
then 1
swinging 1
round 1
until 1
her 1
bow 1
pointed 1
toward 1
the 1
shore 1
she 1
broke 1
adrift 1
once 1
more 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
just 1
as 1
jane 1
clayton 1
was 1
congratulating 1
herself 1
that 1
the 1
ship 1
was 1
once 1
more 1
free 1
there 1
fell 1
upon 1
her 1
ears 1
from 1
a 1
point 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
about 1
where 1
the 1
kincaid 1
had 1
been 1
anchored 1
the 1
rattle 1
of 1
musketry 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
scream 1
shrill 1
piercing 1
fear 1
laden 1
the 1
sailors 1
heard 1
the 1
shots 1
with 1
certain 1
conviction 1
that 1
they 1
announced 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
their 1
employer 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
no 1
relish 1
for 1
the 1
plan 1
that 1
would 1
consign 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
a 1
drifting 1
derelict 1
they 1
whispered 1
together 1
a 1
hurried 1
plan 1
to 1
overcome 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
and 1
hail 1
rokoff 1
and 1
their 1
companions 1
to 1
their 1
rescue 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
fate 1
would 1
play 1
into 1
their 1
hands 1
for 1
with 1
the 1
reports 1
of 1
the 1
guns 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
attention 1
had 1
been 1
distracted 1
from 1
her 1
unwilling 1
assistants 1
and 1
instead 1
of 1
keeping 1
one 1
eye 1
upon 1
them 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
intended 1
doing 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
to 1
peer 1
through 1
the 1
darkness 1
toward 1
the 1
source 1
of 1
the 1
disturbance 1
upon 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
bosom 1
seeing 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
off 1
her 1
guard 1
the 1
two 1
sailors 1
crept 1
stealthily 1
upon 1
her 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
scraping 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
shoes 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
startled 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
a 1
sudden 1
appreciation 1
of 1
her 1
danger 1
but 1
the 1
warning 1
had 1
come 1
too 1
late 1
as 1
she 1
turned 1
both 1
men 1
leaped 1
upon 1
her 1
and 1
bore 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
down 1
beneath 1
them 1
she 1
saw 1
outlined 1
against 1
the 1
lesser 1
gloom 1
of 1
the 1
ocean 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
another 1
man 1
clamber 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
after 1
all 1
her 1
pains 1
her 1
heroic 1
struggle 1
for 1
freedom 1
had 1
failed 1
with 1
a 1
stifled 1
sob 1
she 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
unequal 1
battle 1
chapter 1
17 1
on 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
when 1
mugambi 1
had 1
turned 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
with 1
the 1
pack 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
definite 1
purpose 1
in 1
view 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
obtain 1
a 1
dugout 1
wherewith 1
to 1
transport 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
tarzan 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
nor 1
was 1
he 1
long 1
in 1
coming 1
upon 1
the 1
object 1
which 1
he 1
sought 1
just 1
at 1
dusk 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
canoe 1
moored 1
to 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
a 1
small 1
tributary 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
at 1
a 1
point 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
felt 1
certain 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
find 1
one 1
without 1
loss 1
of 1
time 1
he 1
piled 1
his 1
hideous 1
fellows 1
into 1
the 1
craft 1
and 1
shoved 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
so 1
quickly 1
had 1
they 1
taken 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
canoe 1
that 1
the 1
warrior 1
had 1
not 1
noticed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
already 1
occupied 1
the 1
huddled 1
figure 1
sleeping 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
had 1
entirely 1
escaped 1
his 1
observation 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
that 1
had 1
now 1
fallen 1
but 1
no 1
sooner 1
were 1
they 1
afloat 1
than 1
a 1
savage 1
growling 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
directly 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
dugout 1
attracted 1
his 1
attention 1
to 1
a 1
shivering 1
and 1
cowering 1
figure 1
that 1
trembled 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
great 1
anthropoid 1
to 1
mugambi 1
s 1
astonishment 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
native 1
woman 1
with 1
difficulty 1
he 1
kept 1
the 1
ape 1
from 1
her 1
throat 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
succeeded 1
in 1
quelling 1
her 1
fears 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
fleeing 1
from 1
marriage 1
with 1
an 1
old 1
man 1
she 1
loathed 1
and 1
had 1
taken 1
refuge 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
she 1
had 1
found 1
upon 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
edge 1
mugambi 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
her 1
presence 1
but 1
there 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
rather 1
than 1
lose 1
time 1
by 1
returning 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
the 1
black 1
permitted 1
her 1
to 1
remain 1
on 1
board 1
the 1
canoe 1
as 1
quickly 1
as 1
his 1
awkward 1
companions 1
could 1
paddle 1
the 1
dugout 1
down 1
stream 1
toward 1
the 1
ugambi 1
and 1
the 1
kincaid 1
they 1
moved 1
through 1
the 1
darkness 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
difficulty 1
that 1
mugambi 1
could 1
make 1
out 1
the 1
shadowy 1
form 1
of 1
the 1
steamer 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
it 1
between 1
himself 1
and 1
the 1
ocean 1
it 1
was 1
much 1
more 1
apparent 1
than 1
to 1
one 1
upon 1
either 1
shore 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
it 1
he 1
was 1
amazed 1
to 1
note 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
receding 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
finally 1
he 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
vessel 1
was 1
moving 1
down 1
stream 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
urge 1
his 1
creatures 1
to 1
renewed 1
efforts 1
to 1
overtake 1
the 1
steamer 1
the 1
outline 1
of 1
another 1
canoe 1
burst 1
suddenly 1
into 1
view 1
not 1
three 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
craft 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
the 1
occupants 1
of 1
the 1
stranger 1
discovered 1
the 1
proximity 1
of 1
mugambi 1
s 1
horde 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
at 1
first 1
recognize 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
fearful 1
crew 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
oncoming 1
boat 1
challenged 1
them 1
just 1
as 1
the 1
two 1
dugouts 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
touch 1
for 1
answer 1
came 1
the 1
menacing 1
growl 1
of 1
a 1
panther 1
and 1
the 1
fellow 1
found 1
himself 1
gazing 1
into 1
the 1
flaming 1
eyes 1
of 1
sheeta 1
who 1
had 1
raised 1
himself 1
with 1
his 1
forepaws 1
upon 1
the 1
bow 1
of 1
the 1
boat 1
ready 1
to 1
leap 1
in 1
upon 1
the 1
occupants 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
craft 1
instantly 1
rokoff 1
realized 1
the 1
peril 1
that 1
confronted 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
fellows 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
quick 1
command 1
to 1
fire 1
upon 1
the 1
occupants 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
canoe 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
volley 1
and 1
the 1
scream 1
of 1
the 1
terrified 1
native 1
woman 1
in 1
the 1
canoe 1
with 1
mugambi 1
that 1
both 1
tarzan 1
and 1
jane 1
had 1
heard 1
before 1
the 1
slower 1
and 1
less 1
skilled 1
paddlers 1
in 1
mugambi 1
s 1
canoe 1
could 1
press 1
their 1
advantage 1
and 1
effect 1
a 1
boarding 1
of 1
the 1
enemy 1
the 1
latter 1
had 1
turned 1
swiftly 1
down 1
stream 1
and 1
were 1
paddling 1
for 1
their 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
which 1
was 1
now 1
visible 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
vessel 1
after 1
striking 1
upon 1
the 1
bar 1
had 1
swung 1
loose 1
again 1
into 1
a 1
slow 1
moving 1
eddy 1
which 1
returns 1
up 1
stream 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
southern 1
shore 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
only 1
to 1
circle 1
out 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
join 1
the 1
downward 1
flow 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
or 1
so 1
farther 1
up 1
thus 1
the 1
kincaid 1
was 1
returning 1
jane 1
clayton 1
directly 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
her 1
enemies 1
it 1
so 1
happened 1
that 1
as 1
tarzan 1
sprang 1
into 1
the 1
river 1
the 1
vessel 1
was 1
not 1
visible 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
swam 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
night 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
a 1
ship 1
drifted 1
so 1
close 1
at 1
hand 1
he 1
was 1
guided 1
by 1
the 1
sounds 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
coming 1
from 1
the 1
two 1
canoes 1
as 1
he 1
swam 1
he 1
had 1
vivid 1
recollections 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
occasion 1
upon 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
swum 1
in 1
the 1
waters 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
and 1
with 1
them 1
a 1
sudden 1
shudder 1
shook 1
the 1
frame 1
of 1
the 1
giant 1
but 1
though 1
he 1
twice 1
felt 1
something 1
brush 1
his 1
legs 1
from 1
the 1
slimy 1
depths 1
below 1
him 1
nothing 1
seized 1
him 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
he 1
quite 1
forgot 1
about 1
crocodiles 1
in 1
the 1
astonishment 1
of 1
seeing 1
a 1
dark 1
mass 1
loom 1
suddenly 1
before 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
still 1
expected 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
open 1
river 1
so 1
close 1
was 1
it 1
that 1
a 1
few 1
strokes 1
brought 1
him 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
thing 1
when 1
to 1
his 1
amazement 1
his 1
outstretched 1
hand 1
came 1
in 1
contact 1
with 1
a 1
ship 1
s 1
side 1
as 1
the 1
agile 1
ape 1
man 1
clambered 1
over 1
the 1
vessel 1
s 1
rail 1
there 1
came 1
to 1
his 1
sensitive 1
ears 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1
struggle 1
at 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
deck 1
noiselessly 1
he 1
sped 1
across 1
the 1
intervening 1
space 1
the 1
moon 1
had 1
risen 1
now 1
and 1
though 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
still 1
banked 1
with 1
clouds 1
a 1
lesser 1
darkness 1
enveloped 1
the 1
scene 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
had 1
blotted 1
out 1
all 1
sight 1
earlier 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
his 1
keen 1
eyes 1
therefore 1
saw 1
the 1
figures 1
of 1
two 1
men 1
grappling 1
with 1
a 1
woman 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
accompanied 1
anderssen 1
toward 1
the 1
interior 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
though 1
he 1
suspected 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
quite 1
certain 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
upon 1
which 1
chance 1
had 1
led 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
wasted 1
little 1
time 1
in 1
idle 1
speculation 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
woman 1
in 1
danger 1
of 1
harm 1
from 1
two 1
ruffians 1
which 1
was 1
enough 1
excuse 1
for 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
to 1
project 1
his 1
giant 1
thews 1
into 1
the 1
conflict 1
without 1
further 1
investigation 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
either 1
of 1
the 1
sailors 1
knew 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
force 1
at 1
work 1
upon 1
the 1
ship 1
was 1
the 1
falling 1
of 1
a 1
mighty 1
hand 1
upon 1
a 1
shoulder 1
of 1
each 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
grip 1
of 1
a 1
fly 1
wheel 1
they 1
were 1
jerked 1
suddenly 1
from 1
their 1
prey 1
what 1
means 1
this 1
asked 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
in 1
their 1
ears 1
they 1
were 1
given 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
reply 1
however 1
for 1
at 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
that 1
voice 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
had 1
sprung 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
joy 1
leaped 1
toward 1
their 1
assailant 1
tarzan 1
she 1
cried 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
hurled 1
the 1
two 1
sailors 1
across 1
the 1
deck 1
where 1
they 1
rolled 1
stunned 1
and 1
terrified 1
into 1
the 1
scuppers 1
upon 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
and 1
with 1
an 1
exclamation 1
of 1
incredulity 1
gathered 1
the 1
girl 1
into 1
his 1
arms 1
brief 1
however 1
were 1
the 1
moments 1
for 1
their 1
greeting 1
scarcely 1
had 1
they 1
recognized 1
one 1
another 1
than 1
the 1
clouds 1
above 1
them 1
parted 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
figures 1
of 1
a 1
half 1
dozen 1
men 1
clambering 1
over 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
to 1
the 1
steamer 1
s 1
deck 1
foremost 1
among 1
them 1
was 1
the 1
russian 1
as 1
the 1
brilliant 1
rays 1
of 1
the 1
equatorial 1
moon 1
lighted 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
he 1
realized 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
before 1
him 1
was 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
he 1
screamed 1
hysterical 1
commands 1
to 1
his 1
followers 1
to 1
fire 1
upon 1
the 1
two 1
tarzan 1
pushed 1
jane 1
behind 1
the 1
cabin 1
near 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
standing 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
quick 1
bound 1
started 1
for 1
rokoff 1
the 1
men 1
behind 1
the 1
russian 1
at 1
least 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
raised 1
their 1
rifles 1
and 1
fired 1
at 1
the 1
charging 1
ape 1
man 1
but 1
those 1
behind 1
them 1
were 1
otherwise 1
engaged 1
for 1
up 1
the 1
monkey 1
ladder 1
in 1
their 1
rear 1
was 1
thronging 1
a 1
hideous 1
horde 1
first 1
came 1
five 1
snarling 1
apes 1
huge 1
manlike 1
beasts 1
with 1
bared 1
fangs 1
and 1
slavering 1
jaws 1
and 1
after 1
them 1
a 1
giant 1
black 1
warrior 1
his 1
long 1
spear 1
gleaming 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
behind 1
him 1
again 1
scrambled 1
another 1
creature 1
and 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
horrid 1
horde 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
they 1
most 1
feared 1
sheeta 1
the 1
panther 1
with 1
gleaming 1
jaws 1
agape 1
and 1
fiery 1
eyes 1
blazing 1
at 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
mightiness 1
of 1
his 1
hate 1
and 1
of 1
his 1
blood 1
lust 1
the 1
shots 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
fired 1
at 1
tarzan 1
missed 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
upon 1
rokoff 1
in 1
another 1
instant 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
great 1
coward 1
dodged 1
backward 1
between 1
his 1
two 1
henchmen 1
and 1
screaming 1
in 1
hysterical 1
terror 1
bolted 1
forward 1
toward 1
the 1
forecastle 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
tarzan 1
s 1
attention 1
was 1
distracted 1
by 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
before 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
pursue 1
the 1
russian 1
about 1
him 1
the 1
apes 1
and 1
mugambi 1
were 1
battling 1
with 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
party 1
beneath 1
the 1
terrible 1
ferocity 1
of 1
the 1
beasts 1
the 1
men 1
were 1
soon 1
scampering 1
in 1
all 1
directions 1
those 1
who 1
still 1
lived 1
to 1
scamper 1
for 1
the 1
great 1
fangs 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
and 1
the 1
tearing 1
talons 1
of 1
sheeta 1
already 1
had 1
found 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
single 1
victim 1
four 1
however 1
escaped 1
and 1
disappeared 1
into 1
the 1
forecastle 1
where 1
they 1
hoped 1
to 1
barricade 1
themselves 1
against 1
further 1
assault 1
here 1
they 1
found 1
rokoff 1
and 1
enraged 1
at 1
his 1
desertion 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
moment 1
of 1
peril 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
at 1
the 1
uniformly 1
brutal 1
treatment 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
wont 1
to 1
accord 1
them 1
they 1
gloated 1
upon 1
the 1
opportunity 1
now 1
offered 1
them 1
to 1
revenge 1
themselves 1
in 1
part 1
upon 1
their 1
hated 1
employer 1
despite 1
his 1
prayers 1
and 1
grovelling 1
pleas 1
therefore 1
they 1
hurled 1
him 1
bodily 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
delivering 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
the 1
fearful 1
things 1
from 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
themselves 1
just 1
escaped 1
tarzan 1
saw 1
the 1
man 1
emerge 1
from 1
the 1
forecastle 1
saw 1
and 1
recognized 1
his 1
enemy 1
but 1
another 1
saw 1
him 1
even 1
as 1
soon 1
it 1
was 1
sheeta 1
and 1
with 1
grinning 1
jaws 1
the 1
mighty 1
beast 1
slunk 1
silently 1
toward 1
the 1
terror 1
stricken 1
man 1
when 1
rokoff 1
saw 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
stalked 1
him 1
his 1
shrieks 1
for 1
help 1
filled 1
the 1
air 1
as 1
with 1
trembling 1
knees 1
he 1
stood 1
as 1
one 1
paralyzed 1
before 1
the 1
hideous 1
death 1
that 1
was 1
creeping 1
upon 1
him 1
tarzan 1
took 1
a 1
step 1
toward 1
the 1
russian 1
his 1
brain 1
burning 1
with 1
a 1
raging 1
fire 1
of 1
vengeance 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
murderer 1
of 1
his 1
son 1
at 1
his 1
mercy 1
his 1
was 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
avenge 1
once 1
jane 1
had 1
stayed 1
his 1
hand 1
that 1
time 1
that 1
he 1
sought 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
law 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
power 1
and 1
mete 1
to 1
rokoff 1
the 1
death 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
so 1
long 1
merited 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
none 1
should 1
stay 1
him 1
his 1
fingers 1
clenched 1
and 1
unclenched 1
spasmodically 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
the 1
trembling 1
russ 1
beastlike 1
and 1
ominous 1
as 1
a 1
brute 1
of 1
prey 1
presently 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
sheeta 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
forestall 1
him 1
robbing 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
fruits 1
of 1
his 1
great 1
hate 1
he 1
called 1
sharply 1
to 1
the 1
panther 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
broken 1
a 1
hideous 1
spell 1
that 1
had 1
held 1
the 1
russian 1
galvanized 1
him 1
into 1
sudden 1
action 1
with 1
a 1
scream 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
fled 1
toward 1
the 1
bridge 1
after 1
him 1
pounced 1
sheeta 1
the 1
panther 1
unmindful 1
of 1
his 1
master 1
s 1
warning 1
voice 1
tarzan 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
leap 1
after 1
the 1
two 1
when 1
he 1
felt 1
a 1
light 1
touch 1
upon 1
his 1
arm 1
turning 1
he 1
found 1
jane 1
at 1
his 1
elbow 1
do 1
not 1
leave 1
me 1
she 1
whispered 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
tarzan 1
glanced 1
behind 1
her 1
all 1
about 1
were 1
the 1
hideous 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
some 1
even 1
were 1
approaching 1
the 1
young 1
woman 1
with 1
bared 1
fangs 1
and 1
menacing 1
guttural 1
warnings 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
warned 1
them 1
back 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
these 1
were 1
but 1
beasts 1
unable 1
to 1
differentiate 1
his 1
friends 1
and 1
his 1
foes 1
their 1
savage 1
natures 1
were 1
roused 1
by 1
their 1
recent 1
battle 1
with 1
the 1
sailors 1
and 1
now 1
all 1
flesh 1
outside 1
the 1
pack 1
was 1
meat 1
to 1
them 1
tarzan 1
turned 1
again 1
toward 1
the 1
russian 1
chagrined 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
to 1
forgo 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
personal 1
revenge 1
unless 1
the 1
man 1
should 1
escape 1
sheeta 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
hope 1
of 1
that 1
the 1
fellow 1
had 1
retreated 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
bridge 1
where 1
he 1
now 1
stood 1
trembling 1
and 1
wide 1
eyed 1
facing 1
the 1
beast 1
that 1
moved 1
slowly 1
toward 1
him 1
the 1
panther 1
crawled 1
with 1
belly 1
to 1
the 1
planking 1
uttering 1
uncanny 1
mouthings 1
rokoff 1
stood 1
as 1
though 1
petrified 1
his 1
eyes 1
protruding 1
from 1
their 1
sockets 1
his 1
mouth 1
agape 1
and 1
the 1
cold 1
sweat 1
of 1
terror 1
clammy 1
upon 1
his 1
brow 1
below 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
great 1
anthropoids 1
and 1
so 1
had 1
not 1
dared 1
to 1
seek 1
escape 1
in 1
that 1
direction 1
in 1
fact 1
even 1
now 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
brutes 1
was 1
leaping 1
to 1
seize 1
the 1
bridge 1
rail 1
and 1
draw 1
himself 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
side 1
before 1
him 1
was 1
the 1
panther 1
silent 1
and 1
crouched 1
rokoff 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
his 1
knees 1
trembled 1
his 1
voice 1
broke 1
in 1
inarticulate 1
shrieks 1
with 1
a 1
last 1
piercing 1
wail 1
he 1
sank 1
to 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
then 1
sheeta 1
sprang 1
full 1
upon 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
breast 1
the 1
tawny 1
body 1
hurtled 1
tumbling 1
the 1
russian 1
to 1
his 1
back 1
as 1
the 1
great 1
fangs 1
tore 1
at 1
the 1
throat 1
and 1
chest 1
jane 1
clayton 1
turned 1
away 1
in 1
horror 1
but 1
not 1
so 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
a 1
cold 1
smile 1
of 1
satisfaction 1
touched 1

him 1
for 1
all 1

was 1

in 1

of 1
the 1
hideous 1
death 1

what 1
remained 1

the 1

threatening 1
even 1

loved 1
in 1

that 1
rather 1
than 1
kill 1
his 1

beneath 1

as 1
the 1
morning 1
dawned 1
there 1
came 1
with 1
it 1
a 1
heavy 1
gale 1
from 1
the 1
west 1
which 1
raised 1
a 1
sea 1
into 1
which 1
the 1
mate 1
of 1

kincaid 1
dared 1
not 1
venture 1
all 1
that 1

within 1

witnessed 1
a 1
lessening 1
of 1

was 1
thought 1
safer 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
daylight 1
before 1
attempting 1
the 1
navigation 1
of 1

for 1
they 1
had 1
soon 1
learned 1
through 1

mugambi 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
harm 1
no 1
one 1

at 1
night 1
they 1
were 1
confined 1
below 1
tarzan 1
s 1
joy 1
had 1
been 1
unbounded 1
when 1
he 1
learned 1
from 1
his 1
wife 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
child 1
who 1
had 1
died 1

the 1

or 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
their 1

they 1
could 1
not 1
imagine 1
and 1
as 1
both 1
rokoff 1

paulvitch 1
were 1
gone 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
discovering 1
there 1
was 1
however 1
a 1
certain 1
sense 1
of 1
relief 1
in 1
the 1
knowledge 1
that 1
they 1
might 1
yet 1
hope 1
until 1
positive 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1

reached 1

up 1

assured 1

again 1
that 1

upon 1

recounting 1
to 1
one 1

the 1

of 1

through 1
which 1

had 1
passed 1
since 1

had 1

in 1

at 1

from 1

scowling 1

a 1
hidden 1
watcher 1
upon 1
the 1
shore 1
through 1
the 1
man 1
s 1

passed 1
plan 1
after 1
plan 1
whereby 1
he 1
might 1
thwart 1
the 1
escape 1
of 1
the 1
englishman 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
for 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
vital 1
spark 1
remained 1
within 1
the 1
vindictive 1
brain 1
of 1
alexander 1
paulvitch 1
none 1
who 1
had 1
aroused 1
the 1
enmity 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
might 1
be 1
entirely 1
safe 1
plan 1
after 1
plan 1
he 1
formed 1
only 1
to 1
discard 1
each 1
either 1
as 1
impracticable 1
or 1
unworthy 1
the 1
vengeance 1
his 1
wrongs 1
demanded 1
so 1
warped 1
by 1
faulty 1
reasoning 1
was 1
the 1
criminal 1
mind 1
of 1
rokoff 1
s 1
lieutenant 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
grasp 1
the 1
real 1
truth 1
of 1
that 1
which 1
lay 1
between 1
himself 1
and 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
and 1
see 1
that 1
always 1
the 1
fault 1
had 1
been 1
not 1
with 1
the 1
english 1
lord 1
but 1
with 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
confederate 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
rejection 1
of 1
each 1
new 1
scheme 1
paulvitch 1
arrived 1
always 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
conclusion 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
accomplish 1
naught 1
while 1
half 1
the 1
breadth 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
separated 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
his 1
hatred 1
but 1
how 1
was 1
he 1
to 1
span 1
the 1
crocodile 1
infested 1
waters 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
canoe 1
nearer 1
than 1
the 1
mosula 1
village 1
and 1
paulvitch 1
was 1
none 1
too 1
sure 1
that 1
the 1
kincaid 1
would 1
still 1
be 1
at 1
anchor 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
should 1
he 1
take 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
traverse 1
the 1
jungle 1
to 1
the 1
distant 1
village 1
and 1
return 1
with 1
a 1
canoe 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
and 1
so 1
convinced 1
that 1
thus 1
alone 1
might 1
he 1
hope 1
to 1
reach 1
his 1
prey 1
paulvitch 1
with 1
a 1
parting 1
scowl 1
at 1
the 1
two 1
figures 1
upon 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
deck 1
turned 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
river 1
hastening 1
through 1
the 1
dense 1
jungle 1
his 1
mind 1
centred 1
upon 1
his 1
one 1
fetich 1
revenge 1
the 1
russian 1
forgot 1
even 1
his 1
terror 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
world 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
moved 1
baffled 1
and 1
beaten 1
at 1
every 1
turn 1
of 1
fortune 1
s 1
wheel 1
reacted 1
upon 1
time 1
after 1
time 1
by 1
his 1
own 1
malign 1
plotting 1
the 1
principal 1
victim 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
criminality 1
paulvitch 1
was 1
yet 1
so 1
blind 1
as 1
to 1
imagine 1
that 1
his 1
greatest 1
happiness 1
lay 1
in 1
a 1
continuation 1
of 1
the 1
plottings 1
and 1
schemings 1
which 1
had 1
ever 1
brought 1
him 1
and 1
rokoff 1
to 1
disaster 1
and 1
the 1
latter 1
finally 1
to 1
a 1
hideous 1
death 1
as 1
the 1
russian 1
stumbled 1
on 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
toward 1
the 1
mosula 1
village 1
there 1
presently 1
crystallized 1
within 1
his 1
brain 1
a 1
plan 1
which 1
seemed 1
more 1
feasible 1
than 1
any 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
as 1
yet 1
considered 1
he 1
would 1
come 1
by 1
night 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
and 1
once 1
aboard 1
would 1
search 1
out 1
the 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
original 1
crew 1
who 1
had 1
survived 1
the 1
terrors 1
of 1
this 1
frightful 1
expedition 1
and 1
enlist 1
them 1
in 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
wrest 1
the 1
vessel 1
from 1
tarzan 1
and 1
his 1
beasts 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
were 1
arms 1
and 1
ammunition 1
and 1
hidden 1
in 1
a 1
secret 1
receptacle 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
table 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
infernal 1
machines 1
the 1
construction 1
of 1
which 1
had 1
occupied 1
much 1
of 1
paulvitch 1
s 1
spare 1
time 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
stood 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
confidence 1
of 1
the 1
nihilists 1
of 1
his 1
native 1
land 1
that 1
was 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
sold 1
them 1
out 1
for 1
immunity 1
and 1
gold 1
to 1
the 1
police 1
of 1
petrograd 1
paulvitch 1
winced 1
as 1
he 1
recalled 1
the 1
denunciation 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
had 1
fallen 1
from 1
the 1
lips 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
former 1
comrades 1
ere 1
the 1
poor 1
devil 1
expiated 1
his 1
political 1
sins 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
hempen 1
rope 1
but 1
the 1
infernal 1
machine 1
was 1
the 1
thing 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
now 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
much 1
with 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
get 1
his 1
hands 1
upon 1
it 1
within 1
the 1
little 1
hardwood 1
case 1
hidden 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
table 1
rested 1
sufficient 1
potential 1
destructiveness 1
to 1
wipe 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
fraction 1
of 1
a 1
second 1
every 1
enemy 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
paulvitch 1
licked 1
his 1
lips 1
in 1
anticipatory 1
joy 1
and 1
urged 1
his 1
tired 1
legs 1
to 1
greater 1
speed 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
anchorage 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
his 1
designs 1
all 1
depended 1
of 1
course 1
upon 1
when 1
the 1
kincaid 1
departed 1
the 1
russian 1
realized 1
that 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
accomplished 1
beneath 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
darkness 1
must 1
shroud 1
his 1
approach 1
to 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
side 1
for 1
should 1
he 1
be 1
sighted 1
by 1
tarzan 1
or 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
no 1
chance 1
to 1
board 1
the 1
vessel 1
the 1
gale 1
that 1
was 1
blowing 1
was 1
he 1
believed 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
delay 1
in 1
getting 1
the 1
kincaid 1
under 1
way 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
continued 1
to 1
blow 1
until 1
night 1
then 1
the 1
chances 1
were 1
all 1
in 1
his 1
favour 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
little 1
likelihood 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
attempting 1
to 1
navigate 1
the 1
tortuous 1
channel 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
while 1
darkness 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
water 1
hiding 1
the 1
many 1
bars 1
and 1
the 1
numerous 1
small 1
islands 1
which 1
are 1
scattered 1
over 1
the 1
expanse 1
of 1
the 1

mouth 1
it 1
was 1
well 1
after 1
noon 1
when 1
paulvitch 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
mosula 1
village 1
upon 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
the 1
tributary 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
here 1
he 1
was 1
received 1
with 1
suspicion 1
and 1
unfriendliness 1
by 1
the 1
native 1
chief 1
who 1
like 1

who 1
came 1
in 1

had 1
suffered 1
in 1
some 1
manner 1
from 1
the 1
greed 1
the 1
cruelty 1
or 1
the 1
lust 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
muscovites 1
when 1
paulvitch 1
demanded 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
a 1
canoe 1
the 1
chief 1
grumbled 1
a 1
surly 1
refusal 1
and 1
ordered 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
surrounded 1
by 1
angry 1
muttering 1
warriors 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
but 1
waiting 1
some 1
slight 1
pretext 1
to 1
transfix 1
him 1
with 1
their 1
menacing 1
spears 1
the 1
russian 1
could 1
do 1
naught 1
else 1
than 1
withdraw 1
a 1
dozen 1
fighting 1
men 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
clearing 1
leaving 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
warning 1
never 1
to 1
show 1
himself 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
vicinity 1
of 1
their 1
village 1
stifling 1
his 1
anger 1
paulvitch 1
slunk 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
but 1
once 1
beyond 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
warriors 1
he 1
paused 1
and 1
listened 1
intently 1
he 1
could 1
hear 1
the 1
voices 1
of 1
his 1
escort 1
as 1
the 1
men 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
sure 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
following 1
him 1
he 1
wormed 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
bushes 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
still 1
determined 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
obtain 1
a 1
canoe 1
life 1
itself 1
depended 1
upon 1
his 1
reaching 1
the 1
kincaid 1
and 1
enlisting 1
the 1
survivors 1
of 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
crew 1
in 1
his 1
service 1
for 1
to 1
be 1
abandoned 1
here 1
amidst 1
the 1
dangers 1
of 1
the 1
african 1
jungle 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
enmity 1
of 1
the 1
natives 1
was 1
he 1
well 1
knew 1
practically 1
equivalent 1
to 1
a 1
sentence 1
of 1
death 1
a 1
desire 1
for 1
revenge 1
acted 1
as 1
an 1
almost 1
equally 1
powerful 1
incentive 1
to 1
spur 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
danger 1
to 1
accomplish 1
his 1
design 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
desperate 1
man 1
that 1
lay 1
hidden 1
in 1
the 1
foliage 1
beside 1
the 1
little 1
river 1
searching 1
with 1
eager 1
eyes 1
for 1
some 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
small 1
canoe 1
which 1
might 1
be 1
easily 1
handled 1
by 1
a 1
single 1
paddle 1
nor 1
had 1
the 1
russian 1
long 1
to 1
wait 1
before 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
awkward 1
little 1
skiffs 1
which 1
the 1
mosula 1
fashion 1
came 1
in 1
sight 1
upon 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
a 1
youth 1
was 1
paddling 1
lazily 1
out 1
into 1
midstream 1
from 1
a 1
point 1
beside 1
the 1
village 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
channel 1
he 1
allowed 1
the 1
sluggish 1
current 1
to 1
carry 1
him 1
slowly 1
along 1
while 1
he 1
lolled 1
indolently 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
his 1
crude 1
canoe 1
all 1
ignorant 1
of 1
the 1
unseen 1
enemy 1
upon 1
the 1
river 1
s 1
bank 1
the 1
lad 1
floated 1
slowly 1
down 1
the 1
stream 1
while 1
paulvitch 1
followed 1
along 1
the 1
jungle 1
path 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
behind 1
him 1
a 1
mile 1
below 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
black 1
boy 1
dipped 1
his 1
paddle 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
forced 1
his 1
skiff 1
toward 1
the 1
bank 1
paulvitch 1
elated 1
by 1
the 1
chance 1
which 1
had 1
drawn 1
the 1
youth 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
as 1
that 1
along 1
which 1
he 1
followed 1
rather 1
than 1
to 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
where 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
beyond 1
the 1
stalker 1
s 1
reach 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
brush 1
close 1
beside 1
the 1
point 1
at 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
the 1
skiff 1
would 1
touch 1
the 1
bank 1
of 1
the 1
slow 1
moving 1
stream 1
which 1
seemed 1
jealous 1
of 1
each 1
fleeting 1
instant 1
which 1
drew 1
it 1
nearer 1
to 1
the 1
broad 1
and 1
muddy 1
ugambi 1
where 1
it 1
must 1
for 1
ever 1
lose 1
its 1
identity 1
in 1
the 1
larger 1
stream 1
that 1
would 1
presently 1
cast 1
its 1
waters 1
into 1
the 1
great 1
ocean 1
equally 1
indolent 1
were 1
the 1
motions 1
of 1
the 1
mosula 1
youth 1
as 1
he 1
drew 1
his 1
skiff 1
beneath 1
an 1
overhanging 1
limb 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
tree 1
that 1
leaned 1
down 1
to 1
implant 1
a 1
farewell 1
kiss 1
upon 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
the 1
departing 1
water 1
caressing 1
with 1
green 1
fronds 1
the 1
soft 1
breast 1
of 1
its 1
languorous 1
love 1
and 1
snake 1
like 1
amidst 1
the 1
concealing 1
foliage 1
lay 1
the 1
malevolent 1
russ 1
cruel 1
shifty 1
eyes 1
gloated 1
upon 1
the 1
outlines 1
of 1
the 1
coveted 1
canoe 1
and 1
measured 1
the 1
stature 1
of 1
its 1
owner 1
while 1
the 1
crafty 1
brain 1
weighed 1
the 1
chances 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
should 1
physical 1
encounter 1
with 1
the 1
black 1
become 1
necessary 1
only 1
direct 1
necessity 1
could 1
drive 1
alexander 1
paulvitch 1
to 1
personal 1
conflict 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
dire 1
necessity 1
which 1
goaded 1
him 1
on 1
to 1
action 1
now 1
there 1
was 1
time 1
just 1
time 1
enough 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
kincaid 1
by 1
nightfall 1
would 1
the 1
black 1
fool 1
never 1
quit 1
his 1
skiff 1
paulvitch 1
squirmed 1
and 1
fidgeted 1
the 1
lad 1
yawned 1
and 1
stretched 1
with 1
exasperating 1
deliberateness 1
he 1
examined 1
the 1
arrows 1
in 1
his 1
quiver 1
tested 1
his 1
bow 1
and 1
looked 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
upon 1
the 1
hunting 1
knife 1
in 1
his 1
loin 1
cloth 1
again 1
he 1
stretched 1
and 1
yawned 1
glanced 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
his 1
canoe 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
nap 1
before 1
he 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
after 1
the 1
prey 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
forth 1
to 1
hunt 1
paulvitch 1
half 1
rose 1
and 1
with 1
tensed 1
muscles 1
stood 1
glaring 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
unsuspecting 1
victim 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
lids 1
drooped 1
and 1
closed 1
presently 1
his 1
breast 1
rose 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
deep 1
breaths 1
of 1
slumber 1
the 1
time 1
had 1
come 1
the 1
russian 1
crept 1
stealthily 1
nearer 1
a 1
branch 1
rustled 1
beneath 1
his 1
weight 1
and 1
the 1
lad 1
stirred 1
in 1
his 1
sleep 1
paulvitch 1
drew 1
his 1
revolver 1
and 1
levelled 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
black 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
remained 1
in 1
rigid 1
quiet 1
and 1
then 1
again 1
the 1
youth 1
relapsed 1
into 1
undisturbed 1
slumber 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
crept 1
closer 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
chance 1
a 1
shot 1
until 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
risk 1
of 1
missing 1
presently 1
he 1
leaned 1
close 1
above 1
the 1
mosula 1
the 1
cold 1
steel 1
of 1
the 1
revolver 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
insinuated 1
itself 1
nearer 1
and 1
nearer 1
to 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
the 1
unconscious 1
lad 1
now 1
it 1
stopped 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
above 1
the 1
strongly 1
beating 1
heart 1
but 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
a 1
finger 1
lay 1
between 1
the 1
harmless 1
boy 1
and 1
eternity 1
the 1
soft 1
bloom 1
of 1
youth 1
still 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
brown 1
cheek 1
a 1
smile 1
half 1
parted 1
the 1
beardless 1
lips 1
did 1
any 1
qualm 1
of 1
conscience 1
point 1
its 1
disquieting 1
finger 1
of 1
reproach 1
at 1
the 1
murderer 1
to 1
all 1
such 1
was 1
alexander 1
paulvitch 1
immune 1
a 1
sneer 1
curled 1
his 1
bearded 1
lip 1
as 1
his 1
forefinger 1
closed 1
upon 1
the 1
trigger 1
of 1
his 1
revolver 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
loud 1
report 1
a 1
little 1
hole 1
appeared 1
above 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
sleeping 1
boy 1
a 1
little 1
hole 1
about 1
which 1
lay 1
a 1
blackened 1
rim 1
of 1
powder 1
burned 1
flesh 1
the 1
youthful 1
body 1
half 1
rose 1
to 1
a 1
sitting 1
posture 1
the 1
smiling 1
lips 1
tensed 1
to 1
the 1
nervous 1
shock 1
of 1
a 1
momentary 1
agony 1
which 1
the 1
conscious 1
mind 1
never 1
apprehended 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
dead 1
sank 1
limply 1
back 1
into 1
that 1
deepest 1
of 1
slumbers 1
from 1
which 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
awakening 1
the 1
killer 1
dropped 1
quickly 1
into 1
the 1
skiff 1
beside 1
the 1
killed 1
ruthless 1
hands 1
seized 1
the 1
dead 1
boy 1
heartlessly 1
and 1
raised 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
low 1
gunwale 1
a 1
little 1
shove 1
a 1
splash 1
some 1
widening 1
ripples 1
broken 1
by 1
the 1
sudden 1
surge 1
of 1
a 1
dark 1
hidden 1
body 1
from 1
the 1
slimy 1
depths 1
and 1
the 1
coveted 1
canoe 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
sole 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
man 1
more 1
savage 1
than 1
the 1
youth 1
whose 1
life 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
casting 1
off 1
the 1
tie 1
rope 1
and 1
seizing 1
the 1
paddle 1
paulvitch 1
bent 1
feverishly 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
driving 1
the 1
skiff 1
downward 1
toward 1
the 1
ugambi 1
at 1
top 1
speed 1
night 1
had 1
fallen 1
when 1
the 1
prow 1
of 1
the 1
bloodstained 1
craft 1
shot 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
current 1
of 1
the 1
larger 1
stream 1
constantly 1
the 1
russian 1
strained 1
his 1
eyes 1
into 1
the 1
increasing 1
darkness 1
ahead 1
in 1
vain 1
endeavour 1
to 1
pierce 1
the 1
black 1
shadows 1
which 1
lay 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
anchorage 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
was 1
the 1
ship 1
still 1
riding 1
there 1
upon 1
the 1
waters 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
or 1
had 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
at 1
last 1
persuaded 1
himself 1
of 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
venturing 1
forth 1
into 1
the 1
abating 1
storm 1
as 1
paulvitch 1
forged 1
ahead 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
he 1
asked 1
himself 1
these 1
questions 1
and 1
many 1
more 1
beside 1
not 1
the 1
least 1
disquieting 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
those 1
which 1
related 1
to 1
his 1
future 1
should 1
it 1
chance 1
that 1
the 1
kincaid 1
had 1
already 1
steamed 1
away 1
leaving 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
merciless 1
horrors 1
of 1
the 1
savage 1
wilderness 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
the 1
paddler 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
fairly 1
flying 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
become 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
ship 1
had 1
left 1
her 1
moorings 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
already 1
passed 1
the 1
spot 1
at 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
lain 1
earlier 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
when 1
there 1
appeared 1
before 1
him 1
beyond 1
a 1
projecting 1
point 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
but 1
just 1
rounded 1
the 1
flickering 1
light 1
from 1
a 1
ship 1
s 1
lantern 1
alexander 1
paulvitch 1
could 1
scarce 1
restrain 1
an 1
exclamation 1
of 1
triumph 1
the 1
kincaid 1
had 1
not 1
departed 1
life 1
and 1
vengeance 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
elude 1
him 1
after 1
all 1
he 1
stopped 1
paddling 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
he 1
descried 1
the 1
gleaming 1
beacon 1
of 1
hope 1
ahead 1
of 1
him 1
silently 1
he 1
drifted 1
down 1
the 1
muddy 1
waters 1
of 1
the 1
ugambi 1
occasionally 1
dipping 1
his 1
paddle 1
s 1
blade 1
gently 1
into 1
the 1
current 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
guide 1
his 1
primitive 1
craft 1
to 1
the 1
vessel 1
s 1
side 1
as 1
he 1
approached 1
more 1
closely 1
the 1
dark 1
bulk 1
of 1
a 1
ship 1
loomed 1
before 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
no 1
sound 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
vessel 1
s 1
deck 1
paulvitch 1
drifted 1
unseen 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
side 1
only 1
the 1
momentary 1
scraping 1
of 1
his 1
canoe 1
s 1
nose 1
against 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
planking 1
broke 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
trembling 1
with 1
nervous 1
excitement 1
the 1
russian 1
remained 1
motionless 1
for 1
several 1
minutes 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sound 1
from 1
the 1
great 1
bulk 1
above 1
him 1
to 1
indicate 1
that 1
his 1
coming 1
had 1
been 1
noted 1
stealthily 1
he 1
worked 1
his 1
craft 1
forward 1
until 1
the 1
stays 1
of 1
the 1
bowsprit 1
were 1
directly 1
above 1
him 1
he 1
could 1
just 1
reach 1
them 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
canoe 1
fast 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
but 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
man 1
raised 1
himself 1
quietly 1
aloft 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
he 1
dropped 1
softly 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
thoughts 1
of 1
the 1
hideous 1
pack 1
which 1
tenanted 1
the 1
ship 1
induced 1
cold 1
tremors 1
along 1
the 1
spine 1
of 1
the 1
cowardly 1
prowler 1
but 1
life 1
itself 1
depended 1
upon 1
the 1
success 1
of 1
his 1
venture 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
was 1
enabled 1
to 1
steel 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
frightful 1
chances 1
which 1
lay 1
before 1
him 1
no 1
sound 1
or 1
sign 1
of 1
watch 1
appeared 1
upon 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
deck 1
paulvitch 1
crept 1
stealthily 1
toward 1
the 1
forecastle 1
all 1
was 1
silence 1
the 1
hatch 1
was 1
raised 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
man 1
peered 1
downward 1
he 1
saw 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
crew 1
reading 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
smoky 1
lantern 1
depending 1
from 1
the 1
ceiling 1
of 1
the 1
crew 1
s 1
quarters 1
paulvitch 1
knew 1
the 1
man 1
well 1
a 1
surly 1
cut 1
throat 1
upon 1
whom 1
he 1
figured 1
strongly 1
in 1
the 1
carrying 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
plan 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
conceived 1
gently 1
the 1
russ 1
lowered 1
himself 1
through 1
the 1
aperture 1
to 1
the 1
rounds 1
of 1
the 1
ladder 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
the 1
forecastle 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
eyes 1
turned 1
upon 1
the 1
reading 1
man 1
ready 1
to 1
warn 1
him 1
to 1
silence 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
the 1
fellow 1
discovered 1
him 1
but 1
so 1
deeply 1
immersed 1
was 1
the 1
sailor 1
in 1
the 1
magazine 1
that 1
the 1
russian 1
came 1
unobserved 1
to 1
the 1
forecastle 1
floor 1
there 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
whispered 1
the 1
reader 1
s 1
name 1
the 1
man 1
raised 1
his 1
eyes 1
from 1
the 1
magazine 1
eyes 1
that 1
went 1
wide 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
as 1
they 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
familiar 1
countenance 1
of 1
rokoff 1
s 1
lieutenant 1
only 1
to 1
narrow 1
instantly 1
in 1
a 1
scowl 1
of 1
disapproval 1
the 1
devil 1
he 1
ejaculated 1
where 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
from 1
we 1
all 1
thought 1
you 1
were 1
done 1
for 1
and 1
gone 1
where 1
you 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
ago 1
his 1
lordship 1
will 1
be 1
mighty 1
pleased 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
paulvitch 1
crossed 1
to 1
the 1
sailor 1
s 1
side 1
a 1
friendly 1
smile 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
lips 1
and 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
was 1
extended 1
in 1
greeting 1
as 1
though 1
the 1
other 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
dear 1
and 1
long 1
lost 1
friend 1
the 1
sailor 1
ignored 1
the 1
proffered 1
hand 1
nor 1
did 1
he 1
return 1
the 1
other 1
s 1
smile 1
i 1
ve 1
come 1
to 1

paulvitch 1

of 1
the 1
englishman 1
and 1
his 1
beasts 1

there 1
will 1
be 1
no 1
danger 1
from 1
the 1
law 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
civilization 1
we 1
can 1
sneak 1
in 1
on 1
them 1
while 1
they 1
sleep 1
that 1

greystoke 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
that 1
black 1
scoundrel 1
mugambi 1
afterward 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
simple 1
matter 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
the 1
beasts 1
where 1
are 1
they 1
they 1
re 1
below 1
replied 1
the 1
sailor 1
but 1
just 1
let 1
me 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
paulvitch 1

haven 1
t 1

no 1
more 1
show 1
to 1
turn 1
us 1
men 1
against 1
the 1
englishman 1
than 1
nothing 1
we 1
had 1
all 1

wanted 1
of 1

before 1
long 1
you 1
two 1

like 1
dogs 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
think 1
we 1
got 1
any 1
love 1
for 1
you 1
you 1
better 1
forget 1
it 1
you 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
re 1
going 1
to 1
turn 1
against 1
me 1
demanded 1
paulvitch 1
the 1
other 1
nodded 1
and 1
then 1
after 1
a 1
momentary 1
pause 1
during 1
which 1
an 1
idea 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
spoke 1
again 1
unless 1
he 1
said 1
you 1
can 1
make 1
it 1
worth 1
my 1
while 1
to 1
let 1
you 1
go 1
before 1
the 1
englishman 1
finds 1

here 1

wouldn 1
t 1
turn 1
me 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1

paulvitch 1

in 1
a 1
week 1

d 1

replied 1
the 1
sailor 1
here 1

wouldn 1
t 1

no 1

why 1

paulvitch 1

that 1
the 1
englishman 1
will 1
have 1
you 1
all 1
hanged 1
when 1
he 1
gets 1
you 1
back 1
where 1
the 1
law 1

no 1
he 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
replied 1
the 1
sailor 1
he 1
s 1
told 1
us 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
he 1
says 1
that 1
there 1
wasn 1
t 1
nobody 1
to 1
blame 1
but 1
you 1
and 1
rokoff 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
was 1
just 1
tools 1
see 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
russian 1
pleaded 1
or 1
threatened 1
as 1
the 1
mood 1
seized 1
him 1
sometimes 1
he 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
tears 1
and 1
again 1
he 1
was 1
promising 1
his 1
listener 1
either 1
fabulous 1
rewards 1
or 1
condign 1
punishment 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
was 1
obdurate 1
condign 1
of 1
equal 1
value 1
he 1
made 1
it 1
plain 1
to 1
the 1
russian 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
but 1
two 1
plans 1
open 1
to 1
him 1
either 1
he 1
must 1
consent 1
to 1
being 1
turned 1
over 1
immediately 1
to 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
or 1
he 1
must 1
pay 1
to 1
the 1
sailor 1
as 1
a 1
price 1
for 1
permission 1
to 1
quit 1
the 1
kincaid 1
unmolested 1
every 1
cent 1
of 1
money 1
and 1
article 1
of 1
value 1
upon 1
his 1
person 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
cabin 1
and 1
you 1
ll 1
have 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
your 1
mind 1
mighty 1
quick 1
growled 1
the 1
man 1
for 1
i 1

his 1
lordship 1
or 1
the 1
jungle 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
sorry 1
for 1
this 1
grumbled 1
the 1
russian 1
shut 1
up 1
admonished 1
the 1
sailor 1
if 1
you 1
get 1
funny 1
i 1
may 1
change 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
keep 1
you 1
here 1
after 1
all 1
now 1
paulvitch 1
had 1
no 1
intention 1
of 1
permitting 1
himself 1
to 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
possibly 1
avoid 1
it 1
and 1
while 1
the 1
terrors 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
appalled 1
him 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
his 1
mind 1
infinitely 1
preferable 1
to 1
the 1
certain 1
death 1
which 1
he 1
knew 1
he 1
merited 1
and 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
might 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
is 1
anyone 1
sleeping 1
in 1
my 1
cabin 1
he 1
asked 1
the 1
sailor 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
no 1

said 1

and 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
one 1

yours 1
i 1
ll 1
go 1
and 1
get 1
my 1
valuables 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
paulvitch 1
i 1
ll 1
go 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
try 1
any 1
funny 1
business 1
said 1
the 1
sailor 1
and 1
he 1
followed 1
the 1
russian 1
up 1
the 1
ladder 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
at 1
the 1
cabin 1
entrance 1
the 1
sailor 1
halted 1
to 1
watch 1
permitting 1
paulvitch 1
to 1
go 1
alone 1
to 1
his 1
cabin 1
here 1
he 1
gathered 1
together 1
his 1
few 1
belongings 1
that 1
were 1
to 1
buy 1
him 1
the 1
uncertain 1
safety 1
of 1
escape 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
stood 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
beside 1
the 1
little 1
table 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
piled 1
them 1
he 1
searched 1
his 1
brain 1
for 1
some 1
feasible 1
plan 1
either 1
to 1
ensure 1
his 1
safety 1
or 1
to 1
bring 1
revenge 1
upon 1
his 1
enemies 1
and 1
presently 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
there 1
recurred 1
to 1
his 1
memory 1
the 1
little 1
black 1
box 1
which 1
lay 1
hidden 1
in 1
a 1
secret 1
receptacle 1
beneath 1
a 1
false 1
top 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
where 1
his 1
hand 1
rested 1
the 1
russian 1
s 1
face 1
lighted 1
to 1
a 1
sinister 1
gleam 1
of 1
malevolent 1
satisfaction 1
as 1
he 1
stooped 1
and 1
felt 1
beneath 1
the 1
table 1
top 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
he 1
withdrew 1
from 1
its 1
hiding 1
place 1
the 1
thing 1
he 1
sought 1
he 1
had 1
lighted 1
the 1
lantern 1
swinging 1
from 1
the 1
beams 1
overhead 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
see 1
to 1
collect 1
his 1
belongings 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
held 1
the 1
black 1
box 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
rays 1
of 1
the 1
lamplight 1
while 1
he 1
fingered 1
at 1
the 1
clasp 1
that 1
fastened 1
its 1
lid 1
the 1
lifted 1
cover 1
revealed 1
two 1
compartments 1
within 1
the 1
box 1
in 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
mechanism 1
which 1
resembled 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
a 1
small 1
clock 1
there 1
also 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
battery 1
of 1
two 1
dry 1
cells 1
a 1
wire 1
ran 1

lay 1
within 1
the 1

compartment 1
was 1
not 1
visible 1
for 1
a 1
cover 1
lay 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
sealed 1
in 1
place 1
by 1
asphaltum 1
in 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
box 1
beside 1
the 1
clockwork 1
lay 1
a 1
key 1
and 1
this 1
paulvitch 1
now 1
withdrew 1
and 1
fitted 1
to 1
the 1
winding 1
stem 1
gently 1
he 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
muffling 1
the 1
noise 1
of 1
the 1
winding 1
operation 1
by 1
throwing 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
articles 1
of 1
clothing 1
over 1
the 1
box 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
he 1
listened 1
intently 1
for 1
any 1
sound 1
which 1
might 1
indicate 1
that 1
the 1
sailor 1
or 1
another 1
were 1
approaching 1
his 1
cabin 1
but 1
none 1
came 1
to 1
interrupt 1
his 1
work 1
when 1
the 1
winding 1
was 1
completed 1
the 1
russian 1
set 1
a 1
pointer 1
upon 1
a 1
small 1
dial 1
at 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
clockwork 1
then 1
he 1
replaced 1
the 1
cover 1
upon 1
the 1
black 1
box 1
and 1
returned 1
the 1
entire 1
machine 1
to 1
its 1
hiding 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
table 1
a 1
sinister 1
smile 1
curled 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
bearded 1
lips 1
as 1
he 1
gathered 1
up 1
his 1
valuables 1
blew 1
out 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
stepped 1
from 1
his 1
cabin 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
waiting 1
sailor 1
here 1
are 1
my 1
things 1
said 1
the 1
russian 1
now 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
i 1
ll 1
first 1
take 1
a 1
look 1
in 1
your 1
pockets 1
replied 1
the 1
sailor 1
you 1
might 1
have 1
overlooked 1
some 1
trifling 1
thing 1
that 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
but 1
that 1
ll 1
come 1
in 1
mighty 1
handy 1
to 1
a 1
poor 1
sailorman 1
in 1
london 1
ah 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
feared 1
he 1
ejaculated 1
an 1
instant 1
later 1
as 1
he 1
withdrew 1
a 1
roll 1
of 1
bank 1
notes 1
from 1
paulvitch 1
s 1
inside 1
coat 1
pocket 1
the 1
russian 1
scowled 1
muttering 1
an 1
imprecation 1
but 1
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
gained 1
by 1
argument 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
did 1
his 1
best 1
to 1
reconcile 1
himself 1
to 1
his 1
loss 1
in 1
the 1
knowledge 1
that 1
the 1
sailor 1
would 1
never 1
reach 1
london 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
fruits 1
of 1
his 1
thievery 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
difficulty 1
that 1
paulvitch 1
restrained 1
a 1
consuming 1
desire 1
to 1
taunt 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
suggestion 1
of 1
the 1
fate 1
that 1
would 1
presently 1
overtake 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
company 1
but 1
fearing 1
to 1
arouse 1
the 1
fellow 1
s 1
suspicions 1
he 1
crossed 1
the 1
deck 1
and 1
lowered 1
himself 1
in 1
silence 1
into 1
his 1
canoe 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
paddling 1
toward 1
the 1
shore 1
to 1
be 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
terrors 1
of 1
a 1
hideous 1
existence 1
from 1
which 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
had 1
even 1
a 1
slight 1
foreknowledge 1
of 1
what 1
awaited 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
long 1
years 1
to 1
come 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
fled 1
to 1
the 1
certain 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
rather 1
than 1
endure 1
it 1
the 1
sailor 1
having 1
made 1
sure 1
that 1
paulvitch 1
had 1
departed 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
forecastle 1
where 1
he 1
hid 1
away 1
his 1
booty 1
and 1
turned 1
into 1
his 1
bunk 1
while 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
that 1
had 1
belonged 1
to 1
the 1
russian 1
there 1
ticked 1
on 1

on 1
through 1
the 1
silences 1
of 1
the 1

the 1
little 1
mechanism 1
in 1
the 1

on 1

abated 1
the 1

was 1
cloudless 1

condition 1
seemed 1
ideal 1
for 1
the 1
commencement 1
of 1
the 1
return 1
voyage 1
to 1
jungle 1
island 1
where 1
the 1

were 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
and 1
then 1
home 1
the 1
ape 1

aroused 1
the 1
mate 1
and 1
gave 1
instructions 1
that 1
the 1

sail 1
at 1
the 1
earliest 1
possible 1

for 1
their 1
share 1
in 1
the 1

of 1

with 1
cheerful 1

to 1
their 1

from 1
the 1

of 1

wandered 1
about 1
the 1
deck 1
not 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
the 1
discomfiture 1
of 1
the 1
crew 1
in 1
whose 1
minds 1
there 1
remained 1
a 1
still 1
vivid 1
picture 1
of 1
the 1
savagery 1
of 1
the 1
beasts 1
in 1
conflict 1
with 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
their 1
deaths 1
beneath 1
the 1
fangs 1
and 1
talons 1
which 1
even 1
now 1
seemed 1
itching 1
for 1
the 1
soft 1
flesh 1
of 1
further 1
prey 1
beneath 1
the 1
watchful 1
eyes 1

so 1
that 1
the 1

worked 1
about 1
the 1
deck 1
amongst 1
them 1
in 1
far 1
greater 1
security 1
than 1
they 1
imagined 1
at 1

the 1

slipped 1
down 1
the 1
ugambi 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
shimmering 1
waters 1
of 1
the 1
atlantic 1
tarzan 1
and 1

in 1

for 1

the 1

left 1
his 1
native 1

without 1
one 1
single 1
pang 1
of 1
regret 1
no 1
ship 1
that 1
sailed 1
the 1
seven 1
seas 1
could 1
have 1
borne 1
him 1
away 1
from 1
africa 1
to 1
resume 1
his 1
search 1
for 1
his 1
lost 1
boy 1
with 1
half 1
the 1
speed 1
that 1
the 1
englishman 1
would 1
have 1
desired 1
and 1
the 1
slow 1
moving 1
kincaid 1
seemed 1
scarce 1
to 1
move 1
at 1
all 1
to 1
the 1
impatient 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
bereaved 1
father 1
yet 1
the 1
vessel 1
made 1
progress 1
even 1
when 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
standing 1
still 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
low 1
hills 1
of 1
jungle 1
island 1
became 1
distinctly 1
visible 1
upon 1
the 1
western 1
horizon 1
ahead 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1

the 1
black 1
box 1
ticked 1
ticked 1
ticked 1
with 1
apparently 1
unending 1
monotony 1
but 1
yet 1
second 1
by 1
second 1
a 1
little 1
arm 1
which 1
protruded 1
from 1
the 1
periphery 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
its 1
wheels 1
came 1
nearer 1
and 1
nearer 1
to 1
another 1
little 1
arm 1
which 1
projected 1
from 1
the 1
hand 1
which 1
paulvitch 1
had 1
set 1
at 1
a 1
certain 1
point 1
upon 1
the 1
dial 1
beside 1
the 1
clockwork 1
when 1
those 1
two 1
arms 1
touched 1
one 1
another 1
the 1

of 1

cease 1

jane 1

tarzan 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
bridge 1
looking 1
out 1
toward 1
jungle 1
island 1
the 1
men 1
were 1
forward 1
also 1
watching 1
the 1
land 1
grow 1
upward 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
ocean 1
the 1
beasts 1
had 1
sought 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
the 1
galley 1
where 1
they 1
were 1
curled 1
up 1
in 1
sleep 1
all 1
was 1
quiet 1
and 1
peace 1
upon 1
the 1
ship 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
waters 1
suddenly 1
without 1
warning 1
the 1
cabin 1
roof 1
shot 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
dense 1
smoke 1
puffed 1
far 1
above 1
the 1
kincaid 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
terrific 1
explosion 1
which 1
shook 1
the 1
vessel 1
from 1
stem 1
to 1
stern 1
instantly 1
pandemonium 1
broke 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
terrified 1
by 1
the 1
sound 1
ran 1
hither 1
and 1
thither 1
snarling 1
and 1
growling 1
sheeta 1
leaped 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
screaming 1
out 1
his 1
startled 1
terror 1
in 1
hideous 1
cries 1
that 1
sent 1
the 1
ice 1
of 1
fear 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
crew 1
mugambi 1
too 1
was 1
trembling 1
only 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
retained 1
their 1
composure 1
scarce 1
had 1
the 1
debris 1
settled 1
than 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
was 1
among 1
the 1
beasts 1
quieting 1
their 1
fears 1
talking 1
to 1
them 1
in 1
low 1
pacific 1
tones 1
stroking 1
their 1
shaggy 1
bodies 1
and 1
assuring 1
them 1
as 1
only 1
he 1
could 1
that 1
the 1
immediate 1
danger 1
was 1
over 1
an 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
wreckage 1
showed 1
that 1
their 1
greatest 1
danger 1
now 1
lay 1
in 1
fire 1
for 1
the 1
flames 1
were 1
licking 1
hungrily 1
at 1
the 1
splintered 1
wood 1
of 1
the 1
wrecked 1
cabin 1
and 1
had 1
already 1
found 1
a 1
foothold 1
upon 1
the 1
lower 1
deck 1
through 1
a 1
great 1
jagged 1
hole 1
which 1
the 1
explosion 1
had 1
opened 1
by 1
a 1
miracle 1
no 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
company 1
had 1
been 1
injured 1
by 1
the 1
blast 1
the 1
origin 1
of 1
which 1
remained 1
for 1
ever 1
a 1
total 1
mystery 1
to 1
all 1
but 1
one 1
the 1
sailor 1
who 1
knew 1
that 1
paulvitch 1
had 1
been 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
cabin 1
the 1
previous 1
night 1
he 1
guessed 1
the 1
truth 1
but 1
discretion 1
sealed 1
his 1
lips 1
it 1
would 1
doubtless 1
fare 1
none 1
too 1
well 1
for 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
permitted 1
the 1
arch 1
enemy 1
of 1
them 1
all 1
aboard 1
the 1
ship 1
in 1
the 1
watches 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
where 1
later 1
he 1
might 1
set 1
an 1
infernal 1
machine 1
to 1
blow 1
them 1
all 1
to 1
kingdom 1
come 1
no 1
the 1
man 1
decided 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
keep 1
this 1
knowledge 1
to 1
himself 1
as 1
the 1
flames 1
gained 1
headway 1
it 1
became 1
apparent 1
to 1
tarzan 1
that 1
whatever 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
explosion 1
had 1
scattered 1
some 1
highly 1
inflammable 1
substance 1
upon 1
the 1
surrounding 1
woodwork 1
for 1
the 1
water 1
which 1
they 1
poured 1
in 1
from 1
the 1
pump 1
seemed 1
rather 1
to 1
spread 1
than 1
to 1
extinguish 1
the 1
blaze 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
after 1
the 1
explosion 1
great 1
black 1
clouds 1
of 1
smoke 1
were 1
rising 1
from 1
the 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
doomed 1
vessel 1
the 1
flames 1
had 1
reached 1

half 1

you 1
however 1

the 1

are 1
far 1
too 1

for 1
my 1

it 1
is 1
you 1
whom 1
they 1

doubtless 1

you 1

you 1
are 1
always 1
making 1

stop 1
something 1
which 1
they 1
see 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
they 1
should 1
not 1
do 1
like 1
little 1
children 1
they 1
are 1
doubtless 1
delighted 1
at 1
this 1
opportunity 1
to 1
flee 1
from 1
the 1

of 1

come 1

laughed 1
tarzan 1
for 1
two 1
hours 1
after 1

watching 1
the 1

there 1
came 1
faintly 1
to 1

from 1
across 1

the 1
sound 1
of 1
a 1

settled 1
rapidly 1
almost 1
immediately 1

sank 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
second 1

was 1
less 1
a 1
mystery 1
than 1
that 1
of 1

the 1
flames 1
had 1
finally 1
reached 1
them 1
but 1
what 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
first 1
explosion 1
was 1
a 1
subject 1
of 1
considerable 1
speculation 1

again 1
the 1
first 1

of 1

to 1
locate 1
fresh 1

and 1
make 1
camp 1
for 1
all 1

that 1
their 1

might 1
be 1
drawn 1
out 1
to 1

nearest 1

to 1
this 1
he 1
immediately 1
led 1
the 1
party 1

fell 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
construct 1

not 1

in 1
the 1
most 1

from 1
a 1
lofty 1
pole 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
set 1
in 1

upon 1

that 1
might 1

the 1
tired 1
eyes 1
that 1
in 1
their 1
endless 1
hopeless 1
vigil 1
strained 1
daily 1
out 1
across 1
the 1
vast 1
expanse 1
of 1
ocean 1
it 1
was 1
tarzan 1
who 1
suggested 1
finally 1
that 1
they 1
attempt 1
to 1
construct 1
a 1
vessel 1
that 1
would 1
bear 1
them 1
back 1
to 1
the 1

he 1
alone 1
could 1
show 1
them 1
how 1
to 1
fashion 1

and 1
when 1
the 1
idea 1
had 1
taken 1
root 1
in 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
they 1
were 1
eager 1
to 1
commence 1
their 1
labours 1
but 1
as 1
time 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
the 1
herculean 1
nature 1
of 1
their 1
task 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
apparent 1
they 1
fell 1
to 1
grumbling 1
and 1
to 1
quarrelling 1
among 1
themselves 1
so 1
that 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
dangers 1
were 1
now 1
added 1
dissension 1
and 1

more 1
than 1
before 1

must 1
do 1
for 1
none 1
other 1
could 1
so 1
surely 1
go 1
forth 1
and 1
return 1
with 1
meat 1
as 1
he 1
sometimes 1
mugambi 1
spelled 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
hunting 1
but 1
the 1
black 1
s 1
spear 1
and 1
arrows 1
were 1
never 1
so 1
sure 1
of 1
results 1
as 1
the 1
rope 1
and 1
knife 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
finally 1
the 1
men 1
shirked 1
their 1
work 1
going 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
by 1
twos 1
to 1
explore 1
and 1
to 1
hunt 1

sometimes 1
met 1
them 1
in 1

he 1
hunted 1

as 1

from 1

fallen 1

seeds 1
of 1
discontent 1
were 1
therefore 1
already 1
planted 1
in 1
the 1
camp 1
of 1
the 1
mutineers 1
of 1
the 1
cowrie 1
at 1
the 1
north 1
edge 1
of 1
jungle 1
island 1
but 1
kai 1
shang 1
realized 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
act 1
with 1
circumspection 1
for 1
gust 1
alone 1
of 1
the 1
motley 1
horde 1
possessed 1
sufficient 1
knowledge 1
of 1
navigation 1
to 1
get 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
south 1
atlantic 1
and 1
around 1
the 1
cape 1
into 1
more 1
congenial 1
waters 1
where 1
they 1
might 1
find 1
a 1
market 1
for 1
their 1
ill 1
gotten 1
wealth 1
and 1
no 1
questions 1
asked 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
they 1
sighted 1
jungle 1
island 1
and 1
discovered 1
the 1
little 1
land 1
locked 1
harbour 1
upon 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
cowrie 1
now 1
rode 1
quietly 1
at 1
anchor 1
the 1
watch 1
had 1
discovered 1
the 1
smoke 1
and 1
funnels 1
of 1
a 1
warship 1
upon 1
the 1
southern 1
horizon 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
being 1
spoken 1
to 1
and 1
investigated 1
by 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
war 1
appealed 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
put 1
into 1
hiding 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
until 1
the 1
danger 1
should 1
have 1
passed 1
and 1
now 1
gust 1
did 1
not 1
wish 1
to 1
venture 1
out 1
to 1
sea 1
again 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
telling 1
he 1
insisted 1
but 1
that 1
the 1
ship 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
was 1
actually 1
searching 1
for 1
them 1
kai 1
shang 1
pointed 1
out 1
that 1
such 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
case 1
since 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
for 1
any 1
human 1
being 1
other 1
than 1
themselves 1
to 1
have 1
knowledge 1
of 1
what 1
had 1
transpired 1
aboard 1
the 1
cowrie 1
but 1
gust 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
persuaded 1
in 1
his 1
wicked 1
heart 1
he 1
nursed 1
a 1
scheme 1
whereby 1
he 1
might 1
increase 1
his 1
share 1
of 1
the 1
booty 1
by 1
something 1
like 1
one 1
hundred 1
per 1
cent 1
he 1
alone 1
could 1
sail 1
the 1
cowrie 1
therefore 1
the 1
others 1
could 1
not 1
leave 1
jungle 1
island 1
without 1
him 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
there 1
to 1
prevent 1
gust 1
with 1
just 1
sufficient 1
men 1
to 1
man 1
the 1
schooner 1
slipping 1
away 1
from 1
kai 1
shang 1
momulla 1
the 1
maori 1
and 1
some 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
crew 1
when 1
opportunity 1
presented 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
this 1
opportunity 1
that 1
gust 1
waited 1
some 1
day 1
there 1
would 1
come 1
a 1
moment 1
when 1
kai 1
shang 1
momulla 1
and 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
would 1
be 1
absent 1
from 1
camp 1
exploring 1
or 1
hunting 1
the 1
swede 1
racked 1
his 1
brain 1
for 1
some 1
plan 1
whereby 1
he 1
might 1
successfully 1
lure 1
from 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
anchored 1
ship 1
those 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
determined 1
to 1
abandon 1
to 1
this 1
end 1
he 1
organized 1
hunting 1
party 1
after 1
hunting 1
party 1
but 1
always 1
the 1
devil 1
of 1
perversity 1
seemed 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
soul 1
of 1
kai 1
shang 1
so 1
that 1
wily 1
celestial 1
would 1
never 1
hunt 1
except 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
gust 1
himself 1
one 1
day 1
kai 1
shang 1
spoke 1
secretly 1
with 1
momulla 1
the 1
maori 1
pouring 1
into 1
the 1
brown 1
ear 1
of 1
his 1
companion 1
the 1
suspicions 1
which 1
he 1
harboured 1
concerning 1
the 1
swede 1
momulla 1
was 1
for 1
going 1
immediately 1
and 1
running 1
a 1
long 1
knife 1
through 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
traitor 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
kai 1
shang 1
had 1
no 1
other 1
evidence 1
than 1
the 1
natural 1
cunning 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
knavish 1
soul 1
but 1
he 1
imagined 1
in 1
the 1
intentions 1
of 1
gust 1
what 1
he 1
himself 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
glad 1
to 1
accomplish 1
had 1
the 1
means 1
lain 1
at 1
hand 1
but 1
he 1
dared 1
not 1
let 1
momulla 1
slay 1
the 1
swede 1
upon 1
whom 1
they 1
depended 1
to 1
guide 1
them 1
to 1
their 1
destination 1
they 1
decided 1
however 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
do 1
no 1
harm 1
to 1
attempt 1
to 1
frighten 1
gust 1
into 1
acceding 1
to 1
their 1
demands 1
and 1
with 1
this 1
purpose 1
in 1
mind 1
the 1
maori 1
sought 1
out 1
the 1
self 1
constituted 1
commander 1
of 1
the 1
party 1
when 1
he 1
broached 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
immediate 1
departure 1
gust 1
again 1
raised 1
his 1
former 1
objection 1
that 1
the 1
warship 1
might 1
very 1
probably 1
be 1
patrolling 1
the 1
sea 1
directly 1
in 1
their 1
southern 1
path 1
waiting 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
attempt 1
to 1
reach 1
other 1
waters 1
momulla 1
scoffed 1
at 1
the 1
fears 1
of 1
his 1
fellow 1
pointing 1
out 1
that 1
as 1
no 1
one 1
aboard 1
any 1
warship 1
knew 1
of 1
their 1
mutiny 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
they 1
should 1
be 1
suspected 1
ah 1
exclaimed 1
gust 1
there 1
is 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
wrong 1
there 1
is 1
where 1
you 1
are 1
lucky 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
an 1
educated 1
man 1
like 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
you 1
are 1
an 1
ignorant 1
savage 1
momulla 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
wireless 1
the 1
maori 1
leaped 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
laid 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
hilt 1
of 1
his 1
knife 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
savage 1
he 1
shouted 1
i 1
was 1
only 1
joking 1
the 1
swede 1
hastened 1
to 1
explain 1
we 1
are 1
old 1
friends 1
momulla 1
we 1
cannot 1
afford 1
to 1
quarrel 1
at 1
least 1
not 1
while 1
old 1
kai 1
shang 1
is 1
plotting 1
to 1
steal 1
all 1
the 1
pearls 1
from 1
us 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
navigate 1
the 1
cowrie 1
he 1
would 1
leave 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
all 1
his 1
talk 1
about 1
getting 1
away 1
from 1
here 1
is 1
just 1
because 1
he 1
has 1
some 1
scheme 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
the 1
wireless 1
asked 1
momulla 1
what 1
has 1
the 1
wireless 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
our 1
remaining 1
here 1
oh 1
yes 1
replied 1
gust 1
scratching 1
his 1
head 1
he 1
was 1
wondering 1
if 1
the 1
maori 1
were 1
really 1
so 1
ignorant 1
as 1
to 1
believe 1
the 1
preposterous 1
lie 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
unload 1
upon 1
him 1
oh 1
yes 1
you 1
see 1
every 1
warship 1
is 1
equipped 1
with 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
a 1
wireless 1
apparatus 1
it 1
lets 1
them 1
talk 1
to 1
other 1
ships 1
hundreds 1
of 1
miles 1
away 1
and 1
it 1
lets 1
them 1
listen 1
to 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
said 1
on 1
these 1
other 1
ships 1
now 1
you 1
see 1
when 1
you 1
fellows 1
were 1
shooting 1
up 1
the 1
cowrie 1
you 1
did 1
a 1
whole 1
lot 1
of 1
loud 1
talking 1
and 1
there 1
isn 1
t 1
any 1
doubt 1
but 1
that 1
that 1
warship 1
was 1
a 1
lyin 1
off 1
south 1
of 1
us 1
listenin 1
to 1
it 1
all 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
learned 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
ship 1
but 1
they 1
heard 1
enough 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
crew 1
of 1
some 1
ship 1
was 1
mutinying 1
and 1
killin 1
her 1
officers 1
so 1
you 1
see 1
they 1
ll 1
be 1
waiting 1
to 1
search 1
every 1
ship 1
they 1
sight 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
they 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
far 1
away 1
now 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
ceased 1
speaking 1
the 1
swede 1
strove 1
to 1
assume 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
composure 1
that 1
his 1
listener 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
his 1
suspicions 1
aroused 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
truth 1
of 1
the 1
statements 1
that 1
had 1
just 1
been 1
made 1
momulla 1
sat 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
silence 1
eyeing 1
gust 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
rose 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
great 1
liar 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
get 1
us 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
by 1
tomorrow 1
you 1
ll 1
never 1
have 1
another 1
chance 1
to 1
lie 1
for 1
i 1
heard 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
saying 1
that 1
they 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
run 1
a 1
knife 1
into 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
kept 1
them 1
in 1
this 1
hole 1
any 1
longer 1
they 1
d 1
do 1
it 1
go 1
and 1
ask 1
kai 1
shang 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
wireless 1
replied 1
gust 1
he 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
and 1
that 1
vessels 1
can 1
talk 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
across 1
hundreds 1
of 1
miles 1
of 1
water 1
then 1
say 1
to 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
who 1
wish 1
to 1
kill 1
me 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
do 1
so 1
they 1
will 1
never 1
live 1
to 1
spend 1
their 1
share 1
of 1
the 1
swag 1
for 1
only 1
i 1
can 1
get 1
you 1
safely 1
to 1
any 1
port 1
so 1
momulla 1
went 1
to 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
such 1
an 1
apparatus 1
as 1
a 1
wireless 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
which 1
ships 1
could 1
talk 1
with 1
each 1
other 1
at 1
great 1
distances 1
and 1
kai 1
shang 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
momulla 1
was 1
puzzled 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
wished 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
was 1
willing 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
chances 1
on 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
rather 1
than 1
to 1
remain 1
longer 1
in 1
the 1
monotony 1
of 1
the 1
camp 1
if 1
we 1
only 1
had 1
someone 1
else 1
who 1
could 1
navigate 1
a 1
ship 1
wailed 1
kai 1
shang 1
that 1
afternoon 1
momulla 1
went 1
hunting 1
with 1
two 1
other 1
maoris 1
they 1
hunted 1
toward 1
the 1
south 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
far 1
from 1
camp 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
surprised 1
by 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
ahead 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
they 1
knew 1
that 1
none 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
men 1
had 1
preceded 1
them 1
and 1
as 1
all 1
were 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
island 1
was 1
uninhabited 1
they 1
were 1
inclined 1
to 1
flee 1
in 1
terror 1
on 1
the 1
hypothesis 1
that 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
haunted 1
possibly 1
by 1
the 1
ghosts 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
officers 1
and 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
cowrie 1
but 1
momulla 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
curious 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
superstitious 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
quelled 1
his 1
natural 1
desire 1
to 1
flee 1
from 1
the 1
supernatural 1
motioning 1
his 1
companions 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
example 1
he 1
dropped 1
to 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
crawling 1
forward 1
stealthily 1
and 1
with 1
quakings 1
of 1
heart 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
from 1
which 1
came 1
the 1
voices 1
of 1
the 1
unseen 1
speakers 1
presently 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
a 1
little 1
clearing 1
he 1
halted 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
breathed 1
a 1
deep 1

upon 1

to 1
the 1
mainland 1

a 1
day 1

note 1
the 1

of 1

maori 1
pricked 1
up 1
his 1
ears 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
smattering 1
of 1
every 1
tongue 1
that 1
is 1
spoken 1
upon 1
the 1
seas 1
and 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
few 1
times 1
had 1
he 1
sailed 1
on 1
english 1
ships 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
understood 1
fairly 1
well 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed 1
between 1
schneider 1
and 1
schmidt 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
stumbled 1
upon 1
them 1
he 1
rose 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
clearing 1
schneider 1
and 1
his 1
companion 1
started 1
as 1
nervously 1
as 1
though 1
a 1
ghost 1
had 1
risen 1
before 1
them 1
schneider 1
reached 1
for 1
his 1
revolver 1
momulla 1
raised 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
palm 1
forward 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
his 1
pacific 1
intentions 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
friend 1
he 1
said 1
i 1
heard 1
you 1
but 1
do 1
not 1
fear 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
reveal 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
said 1
i 1
can 1
help 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
help 1
me 1
he 1
was 1
addressing 1
schneider 1
you 1
can 1
navigate 1
a 1
ship 1
but 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
ship 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
ship 1
but 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
navigate 1
it 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
with 1
us 1
and 1
ask 1
no 1
questions 1
we 1
will 1
let 1
you 1
take 1
the 1
ship 1
where 1
you 1
will 1
after 1
you 1
have 1
landed 1
us 1
at 1
a 1
certain 1
port 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
which 1
we 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
later 1
you 1
can 1
take 1
the 1
woman 1
of 1
whom 1
you 1
speak 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
ask 1
no 1
questions 1
either 1
is 1
it 1
a 1
bargain 1
schneider 1
desired 1
more 1
information 1
and 1
got 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
momulla 1
thought 1
best 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
then 1
the 1
maori 1
suggested 1
that 1
they 1
speak 1
with 1
kai 1
shang 1
the 1
two 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
company 1
followed 1
momulla 1
and 1
his 1
fellows 1
to 1
a 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
close 1
by 1
the 1
camp 1
of 1
the 1
mutineers 1
here 1
momulla 1
hid 1
them 1
while 1
he 1
went 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
kai 1
shang 1
first 1
admonishing 1
his 1
maori 1
companions 1
to 1
stand 1
guard 1
over 1
the 1
two 1
sailors 1
lest 1
they 1
change 1
their 1
minds 1
and 1
attempt 1
to 1
escape 1
schneider 1
and 1
schmidt 1
were 1
virtually 1
prisoners 1
though 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
it 1
presently 1
momulla 1
returned 1
with 1
kai 1
shang 1
to 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
briefly 1
narrated 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
the 1
stroke 1
of 1
good 1
fortune 1
that 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
chinaman 1
spoke 1
at 1
length 1
with 1
schneider 1
until 1
notwithstanding 1
his 1
natural 1
suspicion 1
of 1
the 1
sincerity 1
of 1
all 1
men 1
he 1
became 1
quite 1
convinced 1
that 1
schneider 1
was 1
quite 1
as 1
much 1
a 1
rogue 1
as 1
himself 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
fellow 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
island 1
these 1
two 1
premises 1
accepted 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
little 1
doubt 1
that 1
schneider 1
would 1
prove 1
trustworthy 1
in 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
accepting 1
the 1
command 1
of 1
the 1
cowrie 1
was 1
concerned 1
after 1
that 1
kai 1
shang 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
means 1
to 1
coerce 1
the 1
man 1
into 1
submission 1
to 1
his 1
further 1
wishes 1
when 1
schneider 1
and 1
schmidt 1
left 1
them 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
camp 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
feelings 1
of 1
far 1
greater 1
relief 1
than 1
they 1
had 1
experienced 1
in 1
many 1
a 1
day 1
now 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
saw 1
a 1
feasible 1
plan 1
for 1
leaving 1
the 1
island 1
upon 1
a 1
seaworthy 1
craft 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
more 1
hard 1
labour 1
at 1
ship 1
building 1
and 1
no 1
risking 1
their 1
lives 1
upon 1
a 1
crudely 1
built 1
makeshift 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
quite 1
as 1
likely 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
mainland 1
also 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
assistance 1
in 1
capturing 1
the 1
woman 1
or 1
rather 1
women 1
for 1
when 1
momulla 1
had 1
learned 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
black 1
woman 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
camp 1
he 1
had 1
insisted 1
that 1
she 1
be 1
brought 1
along 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
white 1
woman 1
as 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
momulla 1
entered 1
their 1
camp 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
realization 1
that 1
they 1
no 1
longer 1
needed 1
gust 1
they 1
marched 1
straight 1
to 1
the 1
tent 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
might 1
expect 1
to 1
find 1
him 1
at 1
that 1
hour 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
for 1
though 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
more 1
comfortable 1
for 1
the 1
entire 1
party 1
to 1
remain 1
aboard 1
the 1
ship 1
they 1
had 1
mutually 1
decided 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
safer 1
for 1
all 1
concerned 1
were 1
they 1
to 1
pitch 1
their 1
camp 1
ashore 1
each 1
knew 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
was 1
sufficient 1
treachery 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
unsafe 1
for 1
any 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
party 1
to 1
go 1
ashore 1
leaving 1
the 1
others 1
in 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
cowrie 1
so 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
men 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
were 1
ever 1
permitted 1
aboard 1
the 1
vessel 1
unless 1
all 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
was 1
there 1
too 1
as 1
the 1
two 1
crossed 1
toward 1
gust 1
s 1
tent 1
the 1
maori 1
felt 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
his 1
long 1
knife 1
with 1
one 1
grimy 1
calloused 1
thumb 1
the 1
swede 1
would 1
have 1
felt 1
far 1
from 1
comfortable 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
seen 1
this 1
significant 1
action 1
or 1
read 1
what 1
was 1
passing 1
amid 1
the 1
convolutions 1
of 1
the 1
brown 1
man 1
s 1
cruel 1
brain 1
now 1
it 1
happened 1
that 1
gust 1
was 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
in 1
the 1
tent 1
occupied 1
by 1
the 1
cook 1
and 1
this 1
tent 1
stood 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
approach 1
of 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
momulla 1
though 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
of 1
course 1
dream 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
any 1
special 1
significance 1
for 1
him 1
chance 1
had 1
it 1
though 1
that 1
he 1
glanced 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
doorway 1
of 1
the 1
cook 1
s 1
tent 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
moment 1
that 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
momulla 1
approached 1
the 1
entrance 1
to 1
his 1
and 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
noted 1
a 1
stealthiness 1
in 1
their 1
movements 1
that 1
comported 1
poorly 1
with 1
amicable 1
or 1
friendly 1
intentions 1
and 1
then 1
just 1
as 1
they 1
two 1
slunk 1
within 1
the 1
interior 1
gust 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
the 1
long 1
knife 1
which 1
momulla 1
the 1
maori 1
was 1
then 1
carrying 1
behind 1
his 1
back 1
the 1
swede 1
s 1
eyes 1
opened 1
wide 1
and 1
a 1
funny 1
little 1
sensation 1
assailed 1
the 1
roots 1
of 1
his 1
hairs 1
also 1
he 1
turned 1
almost 1
white 1
beneath 1
his 1
tan 1
quite 1
precipitately 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
cook 1
s 1
tent 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
who 1
required 1
a 1
detailed 1
exposition 1
of 1
intentions 1
that 1
were 1
quite 1
all 1
too 1
obvious 1
as 1
surely 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
them 1
plotting 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
momulla 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
life 1
the 1
knowledge 1
that 1
he 1
alone 1
could 1
navigate 1
the 1
cowrie 1
had 1
up 1
to 1
now 1
been 1
sufficient 1
assurance 1
of 1
his 1
safety 1
but 1
quite 1
evidently 1
something 1
had 1
occurred 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
knowledge 1
that 1
would 1
make 1
it 1
quite 1
worth 1
the 1
while 1
of 1
his 1
co 1
conspirators 1
to 1
eliminate 1
him 1
without 1
a 1
pause 1
gust 1
darted 1
across 1
the 1
beach 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
uncanny 1
noises 1
that 1
were 1
indeed 1
frightful 1
came 1
forth 1
from 1
its 1
recesses 1
the 1

if 1

was 1

he 1

the 1

of 1
the 1

were 1
more 1

less 1
problematical 1
while 1
the 1
danger 1
that 1
menaced 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
his 1
companions 1
was 1
a 1
perfectly 1

might 1
be 1
expressed 1
in 1

in 1

by 1
dint 1
of 1
threats 1
and 1
promised 1
rewards 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
had 1
finally 1
succeeded 1
in 1
getting 1
the 1
hull 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
skiff 1
almost 1
completed 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
he 1
and 1
mugambi 1
had 1
done 1
with 1
their 1
own 1
hands 1
in 1
addition 1
to 1
furnishing 1
the 1
camp 1
with 1
meat 1
schneider 1
the 1
mate 1
had 1
been 1
doing 1
considerable 1
grumbling 1
and 1
had 1
at 1
last 1
openly 1
deserted 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
gone 1
off 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
with 1
schmidt 1
to 1
hunt 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
wanted 1
a 1
rest 1
and 1
tarzan 1
rather 1
than 1
add 1
to 1
the 1
unpleasantness 1
which 1
already 1
made 1
camp 1
life 1
almost 1
unendurable 1
had 1
permitted 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
to 1
depart 1
without 1
a 1
remonstrance 1
upon 1
the 1
following 1
day 1
however 1
schneider 1
affected 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
remorse 1
for 1
his 1
action 1
and 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
a 1
will 1
upon 1
the 1
skiff 1
schmidt 1
also 1
worked 1
good 1
naturedly 1
and 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
congratulated 1
himself 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
men 1
had 1
awakened 1
to 1
the 1
necessity 1
for 1
the 1
labour 1
which 1
was 1
being 1
asked 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
to 1
their 1
obligations 1
to 1
the 1
balance 1
of 1
the 1
party 1
it 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
greater 1
relief 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
experienced 1
for 1
many 1
a 1
day 1
that 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
that 1
noon 1
to 1
hunt 1
deep 1
in 1
the 1
jungle 1
for 1
a 1
herd 1
of 1
small 1
deer 1
which 1
schneider 1
reported 1
that 1
he 1
and 1
schmidt 1
had 1
seen 1
there 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
the 1
direction 1
in 1
which 1
schneider 1
had 1
reported 1
seeing 1
the 1
deer 1
was 1
toward 1
the 1
south 1
west 1
and 1
to 1
that 1
point 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
swung 1
easily 1
through 1
the 1
tangled 1
verdure 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
there 1
approached 1
from 1
the 1
north 1
a 1
half 1
dozen 1
ill 1
featured 1
men 1
who 1
went 1
stealthily 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
as 1
go 1
men 1
bent 1
upon 1
the 1
commission 1
of 1
a 1
wicked 1
act 1
they 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
travelled 1
unseen 1
but 1
behind 1
them 1
almost 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
they 1
quitted 1
their 1
own 1
camp 1
a 1
tall 1
man 1
crept 1
upon 1
their 1
trail 1
in 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
eyes 1
were 1
hate 1
and 1
fear 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
curiosity 1
why 1
went 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
momulla 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
thus 1
stealthily 1
toward 1
the 1
south 1
what 1
did 1
they 1
expect 1
to 1
find 1
there 1
gust 1
shook 1
his 1
low 1
browed 1
head 1
in 1
perplexity 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
know 1
he 1
would 1
follow 1
them 1
and 1
learn 1
their 1
plans 1
and 1
then 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
thwart 1
them 1
he 1
would 1
that 1
went 1
without 1
question 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
had 1
thought 1
that 1
they 1
searched 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
finally 1
his 1
better 1
judgment 1
assured 1
him 1
that 1
such 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
case 1
since 1
they 1
had 1
accomplished 1
all 1
they 1
really 1
desired 1
by 1
chasing 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
camp 1
never 1
would 1
kai 1
shang 1
or 1
momulla 1
go 1
to 1
such 1
pains 1
to 1
slay 1
him 1
or 1
another 1
unless 1
it 1
would 1
put 1
money 1
into 1
their 1
pockets 1
and 1
as 1
gust 1
had 1
no 1
money 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
searching 1
for 1
someone 1
else 1
presently 1
the 1
party 1
he 1
trailed 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
halt 1
its 1
members 1
concealed 1
themselves 1
in 1
the 1
foliage 1
bordering 1
the 1
game 1
trail 1
along 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
gust 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
the 1
better 1
observe 1
clambered 1
into 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
the 1
rear 1
of 1
them 1
being 1
careful 1
that 1
the 1
leafy 1
fronds 1
hid 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
view 1
of 1
his 1
erstwhile 1
mates 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
long 1
to 1
wait 1
before 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
strange 1
white 1
man 1
approach 1
carefully 1
along 1
the 1
trail 1
from 1
the 1
south 1
at 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
comer 1
momulla 1
and 1
kai 1
shang 1
arose 1
from 1
their 1
places 1
of 1
concealment 1
and 1
greeted 1
him 1
gust 1
could 1
not 1
overhear 1
what 1
passed 1
between 1
them 1
then 1
the 1
man 1
returned 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
from 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
he 1
was 1
schneider 1
nearing 1
his 1
camp 1
he 1
circled 1
to 1
the 1
opposite 1
side 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
presently 1
came 1
running 1
in 1
breathlessly 1
excitedly 1
he 1
hastened 1
to 1
mugambi 1
quick 1
he 1
cried 1
those 1
apes 1
of 1
yours 1
have 1
caught 1
schmidt 1
and 1
will 1
kill 1
him 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
hasten 1
to 1
his 1
aid 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
call 1
them 1
off 1
take 1
jones 1
and 1
sullivan 1
you 1
may 1
need 1
help 1
and 1
get 1
to 1
him 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
follow 1
the 1
game 1
trail 1
south 1
for 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
i 1
will 1
remain 1
here 1
i 1
am 1
too 1
spent 1
with 1
running 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
mate 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
threw 1
himself 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
panting 1
as 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
almost 1
done 1
for 1
mugambi 1
hesitated 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
to 1
guard 1
the 1
two 1
women 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
then 1
jane 1
clayton 1
who 1
had 1
heard 1
schneider 1
s 1
story 1
added 1
her 1
pleas 1
to 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
mate 1
do 1
not 1
delay 1
she 1
urged 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
here 1
mr 1
schneider 1
will 1
remain 1
with 1
us 1
go 1
mugambi 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
must 1
be 1
saved 1
schmidt 1
who 1
lay 1
hidden 1
in 1
a 1
bush 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
camp 1
grinned 1
mugambi 1
heeding 1
the 1
commands 1
of 1
his 1
mistress 1
though 1
still 1
doubtful 1
of 1
the 1
wisdom 1
of 1
his 1
action 1
started 1
off 1
toward 1
the 1
south 1
with 1
jones 1
and 1
sullivan 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
no 1
sooner 1
had 1
he 1
disappeared 1
than 1
schmidt 1
rose 1
and 1
darted 1
north 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
kai 1
shang 1
of 1
fachan 1
appeared 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
clearing 1
schneider 1
saw 1
the 1
chinaman 1
and 1
motioned 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
coast 1
was 1
clear 1
jane 1
clayton 1
and 1
the 1
mosula 1
woman 1
were 1
sitting 1
at 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
the 1
former 1
s 1
tent 1
their 1
backs 1
toward 1
the 1
approaching 1
ruffians 1
the 1
first 1
intimation 1
that 1
either 1
had 1
of 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
strangers 1
in 1
camp 1
was 1
the 1
sudden 1
appearance 1
of 1
a 1
half 1
dozen 1
ragged 1
villains 1
about 1
them 1
come 1
said 1
kai 1
shang 1
motioning 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
arise 1
and 1
follow 1
him 1
jane 1
clayton 1
sprang 1
to 1
her 1
feet 1
and 1
looked 1
about 1
for 1
schneider 1
only 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
standing 1
behind 1
the 1
newcomers 1
a 1
grin 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
at 1
his 1
side 1
stood 1
schmidt 1
instantly 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
made 1
the 1
victim 1
of 1
a 1
plot 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
she 1
asked 1
addressing 1
the 1
mate 1
it 1
means 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
now 1
escape 1
from 1
jungle 1
island 1
replied 1
the 1
man 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
send 1
mugambi 1
and 1
the 1
others 1
into 1
the 1
jungle 1
she 1
inquired 1
they 1
are 1
not 1
coming 1
with 1
us 1
only 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
and 1
the 1
mosula 1
woman 1
come 1
repeated 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
seized 1
jane 1
clayton 1
s 1
wrist 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
maoris 1
grasped 1
the 1
black 1
woman 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
screamed 1
struck 1
her 1
across 1
the 1
mouth 1
mugambi 1
raced 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
toward 1
the 1
south 1
jones 1
and 1
sullivan 1
trailed 1
far 1
behind 1
for 1
a 1
mile 1
he 1
continued 1
upon 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
relief 1
of 1
schmidt 1
but 1
no 1
signs 1
saw 1
he 1
of 1
the 1
missing 1
man 1
or 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
halted 1
and 1
called 1
aloud 1
the 1
summons 1
which 1
he 1
and 1
tarzan 1
had 1
used 1
to 1
hail 1
the 1
great 1
anthropoids 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
response 1
jones 1
and 1
sullivan 1
came 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
black 1
warrior 1
as 1
the 1
latter 1
stood 1
voicing 1
his 1
weird 1
call 1
for 1
another 1
half 1
mile 1
the 1
black 1
searched 1
calling 1
occasionally 1
finally 1
the 1
truth 1
flashed 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
then 1
like 1
a 1
frightened 1
deer 1
he 1
wheeled 1
and 1
dashed 1
back 1
toward 1
camp 1
arriving 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
moment 1
before 1
full 1
confirmation 1
of 1
his 1
fears 1
was 1
impressed 1
upon 1
him 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
and 1
the 1
mosula 1
woman 1
were 1
gone 1
so 1
likewise 1
was 1
schneider 1
when 1
jones 1
and 1
sullivan 1
joined 1
mugambi 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
killed 1
them 1
in 1
his 1
anger 1
thinking 1
them 1
parties 1
to 1
the 1
plot 1
but 1
they 1
finally 1
succeeded 1
in 1
partially 1
convincing 1
him 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
known 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
they 1
stood 1
speculating 1
upon 1
the 1
probable 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
and 1
their 1
abductor 1
and 1
the 1
purpose 1
which 1
schneider 1
had 1
in 1
mind 1
in 1
taking 1
them 1
from 1
camp 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
swung 1
from 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
a 1
tree 1
and 1
crossed 1
the 1
clearing 1
toward 1
them 1
his 1
keen 1
eyes 1
detected 1
at 1
once 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
radically 1
wrong 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
mugambi 1
s 1
story 1
his 1
jaws 1
clicked 1
angrily 1
together 1
as 1
he 1
knitted 1
his 1
brows 1
in 1
thought 1
what 1
could 1
the 1
mate 1
hope 1
to 1
accomplish 1
by 1
taking 1
jane 1
clayton 1
from 1
a 1
camp 1
upon 1
a 1
small 1
island 1
from 1
which 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
escape 1
from 1
the 1
vengeance 1
of 1
tarzan 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
could 1
not 1
believe 1
the 1
fellow 1
such 1
a 1
fool 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
slight 1
realization 1
of 1
the 1
truth 1
dawned 1
upon 1
him 1
schneider 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
committed 1
such 1
an 1
act 1
unless 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
reasonably 1
sure 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
way 1
by 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
quit 1
jungle 1
island 1
with 1
his 1
prisoners 1
but 1
why 1
had 1
he 1
taken 1
the 1
black 1
woman 1
as 1
well 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
others 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
wanted 1
the 1
dusky 1
female 1
come 1
said 1
tarzan 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
one 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
now 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
trail 1
as 1
he 1
finished 1
speaking 1
a 1
tall 1
ungainly 1
figure 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
jungle 1
north 1
of 1
the 1
camp 1
he 1
came 1
straight 1
toward 1
the 1
four 1
men 1
he 1
was 1
an 1
entire 1
stranger 1
to 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
had 1
dreamed 1
that 1
another 1
human 1
being 1
than 1
those 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
camp 1
dwelt 1
upon 1
the 1
unfriendly 1
shores 1
of 1
jungle 1
island 1
it 1
was 1
gust 1
he 1
came 1
directly 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
your 1
women 1
were 1
stolen 1
he 1
said 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
ever 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
again 1
come 1
quickly 1
and 1
follow 1
me 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
hurry 1
the 1
cowrie 1
will 1
be 1
standing 1
out 1
to 1
sea 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
we 1
reach 1
her 1
anchorage 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
asked 1
tarzan 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
of 1
the 1
theft 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
woman 1
i 1
heard 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
momulla 1
the 1
maori 1
plot 1
with 1
two 1
men 1
of 1
your 1
camp 1
they 1
had 1
chased 1
me 1
from 1
our 1
camp 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
killed 1
me 1
now 1
i 1
will 1
get 1
even 1
with 1
them 1
come 1
gust 1
led 1
the 1
four 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
camp 1
at 1
a 1
rapid 1
trot 1
through 1
the 1
jungle 1
toward 1
the 1
north 1
would 1
they 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
sea 1
in 1
time 1
but 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
minutes 1
would 1
answer 1
the 1
question 1
and 1
when 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
little 1
party 1
did 1
break 1
through 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
the 1
screening 1
foliage 1
and 1
the 1
harbour 1
and 1
the 1
ocean 1
lay 1
before 1
them 1
they 1
realized 1
that 1
fate 1
had 1
been 1
most 1
cruelly 1
unkind 1
for 1
the 1
cowrie 1
was 1
already 1
under 1
sail 1
and 1
moving 1
slowly 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
harbour 1
into 1
the 1
open 1
sea 1
what 1
were 1
they 1
to 1
do 1
tarzan 1
s 1
broad 1
chest 1
rose 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
his 1
pent 1
emotions 1
the 1
last 1
blow 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
fallen 1
and 1
if 1
ever 1
in 1
all 1
his 1
life 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
had 1
had 1
occasion 1
to 1
abandon 1
hope 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
ship 1
bearing 1
his 1
wife 1
to 1
some 1
frightful 1
fate 1
moving 1
gracefully 1
over 1
the 1
rippling 1
water 1
so 1
very 1
near 1
and 1
yet 1
so 1
hideously 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
silence 1
he 1
stood 1
watching 1
the 1
vessel 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
turn 1
toward 1
the 1
east 1
and 1
finally 1
disappear 1
around 1
a 1
headland 1
on 1
its 1
way 1
he 1
knew 1
not 1
whither 1
then 1
he 1
dropped 1
upon 1
his 1
haunches 1
and 1
buried 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
it 1
was 1
after 1
dark 1
that 1
the 1
five 1
men 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
camp 1
on 1
the 1
east 1
shore 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
hot 1
and 1
sultry 1
no 1
slightest 1
breeze 1
ruffled 1
the 1
foliage 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
or 1
rippled 1
the 1
mirror 1
like 1
surface 1
of 1
the 1
ocean 1
only 1
a 1
gentle 1
swell 1
rolled 1
softly 1
in 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
never 1
had 1
tarzan 1
seen 1
the 1
great 1
atlantic 1
so 1
ominously 1
at 1
peace 1
he 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
beach 1
gazing 1
out 1
to 1
sea 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
mainland 1
his 1
mind 1
filled 1
with 1
sorrow 1
and 1
hopelessness 1
when 1
from 1
the 1
jungle 1
close 1
behind 1
the 1
camp 1
came 1
the 1
uncanny 1
wail 1
of 1
a 1
panther 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
familiar 1
note 1
in 1
the 1
weird 1
cry 1
and 1
almost 1
mechanically 1
tarzan 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
answered 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
tawny 1
figure 1
of 1
sheeta 1
slunk 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
half 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
beach 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
moon 1
but 1
the 1
sky 1
was 1
brilliant 1
with 1
stars 1
silently 1
the 1
savage 1
brute 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
long 1
since 1
tarzan 1
had 1
seen 1
his 1
old 1
fighting 1
companion 1
but 1
the 1
soft 1
purr 1
was 1
sufficient 1
to 1
assure 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
animal 1
still 1
recalled 1
the 1
bonds 1
which 1
had 1
united 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
past 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
let 1
his 1
fingers 1
fall 1
upon 1
the 1
beast 1
s 1
coat 1
and 1
as 1
sheeta 1
pressed 1
close 1
against 1
his 1
leg 1
he 1
caressed 1
and 1
fondled 1
the 1
wicked 1
head 1
while 1
his 1
eyes 1
continued 1
to 1
search 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
waters 1
presently 1
he 1
started 1
what 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
strained 1
his 1
eyes 1
into 1
the 1
night 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
and 1
called 1
aloud 1
to 1
the 1
men 1
smoking 1
upon 1
their 1
blankets 1
in 1
the 1
camp 1
they 1
came 1
running 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
but 1
gust 1
hesitated 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
tarzan 1
s 1
companion 1
look 1
cried 1
tarzan 1
a 1
light 1
a 1
ship 1
s 1
light 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
cowrie 1
they 1
are 1
becalmed 1
and 1
then 1
with 1
an 1
exclamation 1
of 1
renewed 1
hope 1
we 1
can 1
reach 1
them 1
the 1
skiff 1
will 1
carry 1
us 1
easily 1
gust 1
demurred 1
they 1
are 1
well 1
armed 1
he 1
warned 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
the 1
ship 1
just 1
five 1
of 1
us 1
there 1
are 1
six 1
now 1
replied 1
tarzan 1
pointing 1
to 1
sheeta 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
have 1
more 1
still 1
in 1
a 1
half 1
hour 1
sheeta 1
is 1
the 1
equivalent 1
of 1
twenty 1
men 1
and 1
the 1
few 1
others 1
i 1
can 1
bring 1
will 1
add 1
full 1
a 1
hundred 1
to 1
our 1
fighting 1
strength 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
them 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
turned 1
and 1
raised 1
his 1
head 1
toward 1
the 1
jungle 1
while 1
there 1
pealed 1
from 1
his 1
lips 1
time 1
after 1
time 1
the 1
fearsome 1
cry 1
of 1
the 1
bull 1
ape 1
who 1
would 1
summon 1
his 1
fellows 1
presently 1
from 1
the 1
jungle 1
came 1
an 1
answering 1
cry 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
and 1
another 1
gust 1
shuddered 1
among 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
creatures 1
had 1
fate 1
thrown 1
him 1
were 1
not 1
kai 1
shang 1
and 1
momulla 1
to 1
be 1
preferred 1
to 1
this 1
great 1
white 1
giant 1
who 1
stroked 1
a 1
panther 1
and 1
called 1
to 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
came 1
crashing 1
through 1
the 1
underbrush 1
and 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
while 1
in 1
the 1
meantime 1
the 1
five 1
men 1
had 1
been 1
struggling 1
with 1
the 1
unwieldy 1
bulk 1
of 1
the 1
skiff 1
s 1
hull 1
by 1
dint 1
of 1
herculean 1
efforts 1
they 1
had 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
s 1
edge 1
the 1
oars 1
from 1
the 1
two 1
small 1
boats 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
washed 1
away 1
by 1
an 1
off 1
shore 1
wind 1
the 1
very 1
night 1
that 1
the 1
party 1
had 1
landed 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
use 1
to 1
support 1
the 1
canvas 1
of 1
the 1
sailcloth 1
tents 1
these 1
were 1
hastily 1
requisitioned 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
akut 1
and 1
his 1
followers 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
water 1
all 1
was 1
ready 1
for 1
embarkation 1
once 1
again 1
the 1
hideous 1
crew 1
entered 1
the 1
service 1
of 1
their 1
master 1
and 1
without 1
question 1
took 1
up 1
their 1
places 1
in 1
the 1
skiff 1
the 1
four 1
men 1
for 1
gust 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
prevailed 1
upon 1
to 1
accompany 1
the 1
party 1
fell 1
to 1
the 1
oars 1
using 1
them 1
paddle 1
wise 1
while 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
followed 1
their 1
example 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
ungainly 1
skiff 1
was 1
moving 1
quietly 1
out 1
to 1
sea 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
light 1
which 1
rose 1
and 1
fell 1
gently 1
with 1
the 1
swell 1
a 1
sleepy 1
sailor 1
kept 1
a 1
poor 1
vigil 1
upon 1
the 1
cowrie 1
s 1
deck 1
while 1
in 1
the 1
cabin 1
below 1
schneider 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
arguing 1
with 1
jane 1
clayton 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
revolver 1
in 1
a 1
table 1
drawer 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
locked 1
and 1
now 1
she 1
kept 1
the 1
mate 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
at 1
bay 1
with 1
the 1
weapon 1
the 1
mosula 1
woman 1
kneeled 1
behind 1
her 1
while 1
schneider 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
before 1
the 1
door 1
threatening 1
and 1
pleading 1
and 1
promising 1
but 1
all 1
to 1
no 1
avail 1
presently 1
from 1
the 1
deck 1
above 1
came 1
a 1
shout 1
of 1
warning 1
and 1
a 1
shot 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
jane 1
clayton 1
relaxed 1
her 1
vigilance 1
and 1
turned 1
her 1
eyes 1
toward 1
the 1
cabin 1
skylight 1
simultaneously 1
schneider 1
was 1
upon 1
her 1
the 1
first 1
intimation 1
the 1
watch 1
had 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
craft 1
within 1
a 1
thousand 1
miles 1
of 1
the 1
cowrie 1
came 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
shoulders 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
poked 1
over 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
side 1
instantly 1
the 1
fellow 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
and 1
levelled 1
his 1
revolver 1
at 1
the 1
intruder 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
cry 1
and 1
the 1
subsequent 1
report 1
of 1
the 1
revolver 1
which 1
threw 1
jane 1
clayton 1
off 1
her 1
guard 1
upon 1
deck 1
the 1
quiet 1
of 1
fancied 1
security 1
soon 1
gave 1
place 1
to 1
the 1
wildest 1
pandemonium 1
the 1
crew 1
of 1
the 1
cowrie 1
rushed 1
above 1
armed 1
with 1
revolvers 1
cutlasses 1
and 1
the 1
long 1
knives 1
that 1
many 1
of 1
them 1
habitually 1
wore 1
but 1
the 1
alarm 1
had 1
come 1
too 1
late 1
already 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
tarzan 1
were 1
upon 1
the 1
ship 1
s 1
deck 1
with 1
tarzan 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
kincaid 1
s 1
crew 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
frightful 1
beasts 1
the 1
courage 1
of 1
the 1
mutineers 1
wavered 1
and 1
broke 1
those 1
with 1
revolvers 1
fired 1
a 1
few 1
scattering 1
shots 1
and 1
then 1
raced 1
for 1
some 1
place 1
of 1
supposed 1
safety 1
into 1
the 1
shrouds 1
went 1
some 1
but 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
were 1
more 1
at 1
home 1
there 1
than 1
they 1
screaming 1
with 1
terror 1
the 1
maoris 1
were 1
dragged 1
from 1
their 1
lofty 1
perches 1
the 1
beasts 1
uncontrolled 1
by 1
tarzan 1
who 1
had 1
gone 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
jane 1
loosed 1
the 1
full 1
fury 1
of 1
their 1
savage 1
natures 1
upon 1
the 1
unhappy 1
wretches 1
who 1
fell 1
into 1
their 1
clutches 1
sheeta 1
in 1
the 1
meanwhile 1
had 1
felt 1
his 1
great 1
fangs 1
sink 1
into 1
but 1
a 1
single 1
jugular 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
mauled 1
the 1
corpse 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
spied 1
kai 1
shang 1
darting 1
down 1
the 1
companionway 1
toward 1
his 1
cabin 1
with 1
a 1
shrill 1
scream 1
sheeta 1
was 1
after 1
him 1
a 1
scream 1
which 1
awoke 1
an 1
almost 1
equally 1
uncanny 1
cry 1
in 1
the 1
throat 1
of 1
the 1
terror 1
stricken 1
chinaman 1
but 1
kai 1
shang 1
reached 1
his 1
cabin 1
a 1
fraction 1
of 1
a 1
second 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
panther 1
and 1
leaping 1
within 1
slammed 1
the 1
door 1
just 1
too 1
late 1
sheeta 1
s 1
great 1
body 1
hurtled 1
against 1
it 1
before 1
the 1
catch 1
engaged 1
and 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
kai 1
shang 1
was 1
gibbering 1
and 1
shrieking 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
an 1
upper 1
berth 1
lightly 1
sheeta 1
sprang 1
after 1
his 1
victim 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
wicked 1
days 1
of 1
kai 1
shang 1
of 1
fachan 1
were 1
ended 1
and 1
sheeta 1
was 1
gorging 1
himself 1
upon 1
tough 1
and 1
stringy 1
flesh 1
a 1
moment 1
scarcely 1
had 1
elapsed 1
after 1
schneider 1
leaped 1
upon 1
jane 1
clayton 1
and 1
wrenched 1
the 1
revolver 1
from 1
her 1
hand 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
cabin 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
tall 1
and 1
half 1
naked 1
white 1
man 1
stood 1
framed 1
within 1
the 1
portal 1
silently 1
he 1
leaped 1
across 1
the 1
cabin 1
schneider 1
felt 1
sinewy 1
fingers 1
at 1
his 1
throat 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
see 1
who 1
had 1
attacked 1
him 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
went 1
wide 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
close 1
above 1
his 1
own 1
grimly 1
the 1
fingers 1
tightened 1
upon 1
the 1
mate 1
s 1
throat 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
scream 1
to 1
plead 1
but 1
no 1
sound 1
came 1
forth 1
his 1
eyes 1
protruded 1
as 1
he 1
struggled 1
for 1
freedom 1
for 1
breath 1
for 1
life 1
jane 1
clayton 1
seized 1
her 1
husband 1
s 1
hands 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
drag 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
throat 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
man 1
but 1
tarzan 1
only 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
not 1
again 1
he 1
said 1
quietly 1
before 1
have 1
i 1
permitted 1
scoundrels 1
to 1
live 1
only 1
to 1
suffer 1
and 1
to 1
have 1
you 1
suffer 1
for 1
my 1
mercy 1
this 1
time 1
we 1
shall 1
make 1
sure 1
of 1
one 1
scoundrel 1
sure 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
never 1
again 1
harm 1
us 1
or 1
another 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
wrench 1
he 1
twisted 1
the 1
neck 1
of 1
the 1
perfidious 1
mate 1
until 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sharp 1
crack 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
s 1
body 1
lay 1
limp 1
and 1
motionless 1
in 1
the 1
ape 1
man 1
s 1
grasp 1
with 1
a 1
gesture 1
of 1
disgust 1
tarzan 1
tossed 1
the 1
corpse 1
aside 1
then 1
he 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
deck 1
followed 1
by 1
jane 1
and 1
the 1
mosula 1
woman 1
the 1
battle 1
there 1
was 1
over 1
schmidt 1
and 1
momulla 1
and 1
two 1
others 1
alone 1
remained 1
alive 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
the 1
cowrie 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
sanctuary 1
in 1
the 1
forecastle 1
the 1
others 1
had 1
died 1
horribly 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
deserved 1
beneath 1
the 1
fangs 1
and 1
talons 1
of 1
the 1
beasts 1
of 1
tarzan 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
sun 1
rose 1
on 1
a 1
grisly 1
sight 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
of 1
the 1
unhappy 1
cowrie 1
but 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
blood 1
which 1
stained 1
her 1
white 1
planking 1
was 1
the 1
blood 1
of 1
the 1
guilty 1
and 1
not 1
of 1
the 1
innocent 1
tarzan 1
brought 1
forth 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
had 1
hidden 1
in 1
the 1
forecastle 1
and 1
without 1
promises 1
of 1
immunity 1
from 1
punishment 1
forced 1
them 1
to 1
help 1
work 1
the 1
vessel 1
the 1
only 1
alternative 1
was 1
immediate 1
death 1
a 1
stiff 1
breeze 1
had 1
risen 1
with 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
with 1
canvas 1
spread 1
the 1
cowrie 1
set 1
in 1
toward 1
jungle 1
island 1
where 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
later 1
tarzan 1
picked 1
up 1
gust 1
and 1
bid 1
farewell 1
to 1
sheeta 1
and 1
the 1
apes 1
of 1
akut 1
for 1
here 1
he 1
set 1
the 1
beasts 1
ashore 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
wild 1
and 1
natural 1
life 1
they 1
loved 1
so 1
well 1
nor 1
did 1
they 1
lose 1
a 1
moment 1
s 1
time 1
in 1
disappearing 1
into 1
the 1
cool 1
depths 1
of 1
their 1
beloved 1
jungle 1
that 1
they 1
knew 1
that 1
tarzan 1
was 1
to 1
leave 1
them 1
may 1
be 1
doubted 1
except 1
possibly 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
more 1
intelligent 1
akut 1
who 1
alone 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
others 1
remained 1
upon 1
the 1
beach 1
as 1
the 1
small 1
boat 1
drew 1
away 1
toward 1
the 1
schooner 1
carrying 1
his 1
savage 1
lord 1
and 1
master 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
their 1
eyes 1
could 1
span 1
the 1
distance 1
jane 1
and 1
tarzan 1
standing 1
upon 1
the 1
deck 1
saw 1
the 1
lonely 1
figure 1
of 1
the 1
shaggy 1
anthropoid 1
motionless 1
upon 1
the 1
surf 1
beaten 1
sands 1
of 1
jungle 1
island 1
it 1
was 1
three 1
days 1
later 1
that 1
the 1
cowrie 1
fell 1
in 1
with 1
h 1
m 1
sloop 1
of 1
war 1
shorewater 1
through 1
whose 1
wireless 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
soon 1
got 1
in 1
communication 1
with 1
london 1
thus 1
he 1
learned 1
that 1
which 1
filled 1
his 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
s 1
heart 1
with 1
joy 1
and 1
thanksgiving 1
little 1
jack 1
was 1
safe 1
at 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
s 1
town 1
house 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
until 1
they 1
reached 1
london 1
that 1
they 1
learned 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
the 1
remarkable 1
chain 1
of 1
circumstances 1
that 1
had 1
preserved 1
the 1
infant 1
unharmed 1
it 1
developed 1
that 1
rokoff 1
fearing 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
child 1
aboard 1
the 1
kincaid 1
by 1
day 1
had 1
hidden 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
den 1
where 1
nameless 1
infants 1
were 1
harboured 1
intending 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
steamer 1
after 1
dark 1
his 1
confederate 1
and 1
chief 1
lieutenant 1
paulvitch 1
true 1
to 1
the 1
long 1
years 1
of 1
teaching 1
of 1
his 1
wily 1
master 1
had 1
at 1
last 1
succumbed 1
to 1
the 1
treachery 1
and 1
greed 1
that 1
had 1
always 1
marked 1
his 1
superior 1
and 1
lured 1
by 1
the 1
thoughts 1
of 1
the 1
immense 1
ransom 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
win 1
by 1
returning 1
the 1
child 1
unharmed 1
had 1
divulged 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
its 1
parentage 1
to 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
maintained 1
the 1
foundling 1
asylum 1
through 1
her 1
he 1
had 1
arranged 1
for 1
the 1
substitution 1
of 1
another 1
infant 1
knowing 1
full 1
well 1
that 1
never 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
would 1
rokoff 1
suspect 1
the 1
trick 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
played 1
upon 1
him 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
promised 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
child 1
until 1
paulvitch 1
returned 1
to 1
england 1
but 1
she 1
in 1
turn 1
had 1
been 1
tempted 1
to 1
betray 1
her 1
trust 1
by 1
the 1
lure 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
so 1
had 1
opened 1
negotiations 1
with 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
s 1
solicitors 1
for 1
the 1
return 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
esmeralda 1
the 1
old 1
negro 1
nurse 1
whose 1
absence 1
on 1
a 1
vacation 1
in 1
america 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
abduction 1
of 1
little 1
jack 1
had 1
been 1
attributed 1
by 1
her 1
as 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
calamity 1
had 1
returned 1
and 1
positively 1
identified 1
the 1
infant 1
the 1
ransom 1
had 1
been 1
paid 1
and 1
within 1
ten 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
his 1
kidnapping 1
the 1
future 1
lord 1
greystoke 1
none 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
his 1
experience 1
had 1
been 1
returned 1
to 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
home 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
last 1
and 1
greatest 1
of 1
nikolas 1
rokoff 1
s 1
many 1
rascalities 1
had 1
not 1
only 1
miserably 1
miscarried 1
through 1
the 1
treachery 1
he 1
had 1
taught 1
his 1
only 1
friend 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
resulted 1
in 1
the 1
arch 1
villain 1
s 1
death 1
and 1
given 1
to 1
lord 1
and 1
lady 1
greystoke 1
a 1
peace 1
of 1
mind 1
that 1
neither 1
could 1
ever 1
have 1
felt 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
the 1
vital 1
spark 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
russian 1
and 1
his 1
malign 1
mind 1
was 1
free 1
to 1
formulate 1
new 1
atrocities 1
against 1
them 1
rokoff 1
was 1
dead 1
and 1
while 1
the 1
fate 1
of 1
paulvitch 1
was 1
unknown 1
they 1
had 1
every 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
succumbed 1
to 1
the 1
dangers 1
of 1
the 1
jungle 1
where 1
last 1
they 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
the 1
malicious 1
tool 1
of 1
his 1
master 1
and 1
thus 1
in 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
they 1
might 1
know 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
freed 1
for 1
ever 1
from 1
the 1
menace 1
of 1
these 1
two 1
men 1
the 1
only 1
enemies 1
which 1
tarzan 1
of 1
the 1
apes 1
ever 1
had 1
had 1
occasion 1
to 1
fear 1
because 1
they 1
struck 1
at 1
him 1
cowardly 1
blows 1
through 1
those 1
he 1
loved 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
happy 1
family 1
party 1
that 1
were 1
reunited 1
in 1
greystoke 1
house 1
the 1
day 1
that 1
